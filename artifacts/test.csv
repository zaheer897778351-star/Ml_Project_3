Was a really great read just wish there would have been more of it. Hope to find more by this author.,0
Nope. I tried. Can't read it. I will take the greatest delight in deleting this from my Kindle. A total waste of time.,0
The story line just drug on and on. I did not like this book very much and if you are a mystery fan I would not tell you it is worth reading.,0
"I have read several angel books but this one did not work for me. I didn't really feel that there was much of a story line and I didn't fall in love with the characters. On a postive note: the author is very good at writing sex scenes, but I was tired of reading them. By the second one, I was skipping past them to get back to true story and find out what the conflict was going to be. I feel that the book was more about the sexual chemistry than about a dark angel / human conflict.",0
"Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The beginning is positively excrable.  I can see that this book was started when the author was very young.  The sex scences would be laughable if they did not make me squirm so much.  I have no problem with erotica, rather enjoy it on occassion, but her scenes are jarring.  One minute they are caressing and kissing, next his c@ck is pounding her... well, you get the idea.  Do not make the same mistake I did, you will just loathe yourself afterwards.",0
"Book 1 of 3 in ""Badlands"" series. Book 2 isTwo Wanted Men, Book 3Double Chance Claim. Note thatBadlandsappears to combine all three, in paperback.Plot:When her life in New York became unbearable, Clarissa signed on as a Mail Order Bride. Her choices narrowed when her fiancee married someone else just days before her train arrived. Luckily for her (?!) the wife Derek and Logan had ordered jumped off the train. Lots of sex later and a non-traditional marriage may well lead to a HEA in the Badlands.Comments:- 2170 kindle locations, 27,767 words- Set in ""The Badlands"", South Dakota, 1890.- m/f/m - they get into it very quickly (by chapter 3) and keep it up to the end! Frequent, explicit, generous.Opinion:A surprisingly nice little story. Lots and lots of Wild West cowboy menage; the whole book is really just two days of unbridled bonk-fest. Yet there is a nice little plot interweaved  that is thoroughly enjoyable and allows you to convince yourself you're not just reading smut. *grin* Good characters, nice story, happy ending.Aside:The Badlands books are written by ""Elle Saint James"" but looking around it appears this is a pseudonym. Does this matter? Probably not. And I'm not going to say who I believe it is, 'cause that would be telling... Okay, it's not difficult to work out but where would the fun be in that? If an author writes under multiple names, there's usually a reason. Often the author is testing a different voice, or a different genre. In this case I suspect she is using it to delve into the cowboy menage genre (not really featured under her other name). And ""Elle Saint James"" is an excellent name for Wild West author. Very evocative.***SPOILER***Derek and Logan's ordered wife, Miss Miranda Hetherington, jumped from the train. Her story is told in Book 2 ""Two Wanted Men"".-CR-",1
"There is nothing here that's remotely interesting beyond the travelogue of Australia. The author calls it a romantic comedy; for the life of me I could not find a single thing that was funny - only boring. The book seems like an attempt to preach some sort of message about love and relationships, but the the characters come across as two-dimensional, too serious, too predictable, too stilted, too artificial, too asexual, too pure. Honestly, if I ever met somebody like Drew I'd get as far away from him as fast as possible. He'd bore me to tears. She probably would too.",0
"Tip his is probably the 'darkest' book I've read, but I loved it. Judgement is scary because its probably realistic and the reality of the book would be horrible. But it's so well written you cannot put it down, and you need to know what's going to happen.",1
"First off, I must say A. McKinnon either is not reading this series, or cannot see the humor in the Halle Puma series.  This one was short, which is my only complaint.  This series is adorable, charming, enertaining and sexy.  Light, fluffy fun which does not warrant a long, overly wordy and dull review.  Got a couple of free hours and want some fun?  Read Sweet Dreams!",1
"I bought this jacket because I had bought a new Kindle and needed something to protect it in my purse.  The dimensions were absolutely correct after measuring my Kindle to make sure it would fit.  When I received the jacket, it was way too small for my Kindle.  Not going to return it because the shiipping cost would be too much.  :-(",0
"Would have given four stars but the ending I couldn't handle. Was pretty good read till then, it just ruined it for me.",0
"This story was very short but I expected that since it was free.  Unfortunately, it was also very pat, very rote.  This was a royal princess who had been reduced to slavery.  I found nothing regal about her in her thoughts, words or actions.  There was also the fact that she had not eaten in two weeks.  Really?  She certainly had enough energy to trash her quarters completely and to have sex with a complete stranger.  She seemed quite satisfied after eating an apple and one berry.  That just struck me as completely unbelievable.I'm afraid I skimmed most of the rest of the book.  It consisted mostly of sex and the full-grown Prince grovelling to his parents.  I don't agree really with the others that it ended too quickly.  I think the author wrapped up the story well enough.  They got their happily ever after and set it up to sell another story.I probably wont buy from the author again.  I don't like the H to be weak nor do I like the h to be a slut.  I can't imaging that her other stories will stray much from the basic outline of this one.  I just re-read this review and it sounds a bit harsh.  Unfortunately, I still believe every word so I'll post it as it stands.",0
"I read nearly all my books and magazines on Kindle.  I have had a paper subscription for the WSJ for several years but have trouble reading the small print.  Nevertheless, I renewed it via Amazon and Kindle in the apparently mistaken belief that I would be able to read it on more than my Kindle (I have two).  First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.  This isn't quite a disaster - but it comes close.If I were you, I'd buy the print/digital combination directly and use either the Kindle or the iPad - not the special app.Ok, I'm part of the disaster - I thought I was ordering the Kindle and print versions and somehow managed to just order the print version.  After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.  I can now read it on the Kindle Fire, my iMac - and if I can find my iPad, probably there.  All things considered, the product is a good one - but the price extracted for buying it thru Amazon is too high.  I suppose I'll have to change my email -",0
Man I wish these series were longer. I thought the book was really good. I was so into this book.,0
"This book was the very first bookmobile book I bought when I was in the school book club. I loved the story then and I bet a dollar to a donut I will love it again. If my memory serves, I bought this book in 5th grade. That would have been about 1961. I am looking forward to reliving the memories.",1
I paid for this and was VERY disappointed to find that it was only about 20 pages. SHAME on Amazon for charging for this short story that I read in about 10 minutes. I do enjoy the novels this author writes but this one should have been free on kindle. In the future I will be more careful and not get taken again....,0
This was entertaining. It seems it could have been the inspiration of the TV series LOST. So many things are so alike.,0
"I have relied on BBC for many years for international news coverage. I have, however, longed for the more in-depth coverage that can be represented in an excellent newspaper. As I live in a rural area such newspapers have been prohibitively expensive and untimely. The International Herald Tribune solves all these problems with well-selected news and well-written editorials.",1
Zsadist and Bella 's story was so sweet. Zsadist is loving and caring and I just love him. I wish all though thing didn't happen to him.,1
As always!!! Loved them!! Love the Westmoreland family. All five of the books were fantastic.  Looking forward to the next five.,1
"There are a couple of things you need to consider before you buy this book.  Are you a survivalist?  Do you spend your weekends thinking up ways to survive once society collapses?  Do you keep a store of medical supplies, canned foods, and firearms and practice using them in extreme conditions?  If this is the kind of thing you enjoy doing and thinking about, then ""The Birth of the Peacekeepers."" will be great fun for you and you will find much in common with the book's protagonist.  On the other hand, if think survivalists are nutcases and nightmares of a future world with no people haunt your nights, then you will not enjoy this book in the least.",1
"An ok read, but not one i would put on the top of my recommendation list. I am keen however to read something else by the author to compare it against. A second opportunity is deserved.",0
"I thought this was a real book that would give me great advice on marketing my book. When I finished reading what I thought was the Foreword or introduction, I realized I had just completed the entire book. Advice given was common sense, and I didn't learn anything. Besides, the format, grammar, and spelling is not what I would call top-notch for someone in the business.",0
"This was not anything special. I thought it might be a fun read, but not whatsoever. Starts out decent, but really doesn't go anywhere.",0
A great short that sticks with you.  It was remarkably powerful for a work of such a short length.  Congrats to Joe Hill for weaving such a strange but memorable tale!,1
"I'll be honest, this isn't my favorite series, but it's ok. I like the shifters and the inner battle of Maggie to get past her traumatic past and to embrace who she is fully. Like all of the books in this series it revolves around mates, Erik and Maggie. You have no choice who your mate is, it's just chemical and 'fated'. So in the midst of the story there is a bunch of sex think, a little sex but mostly just wishing. So this one has Maggie and Erik, along with Jared and TJ, going to the Wolf Games, an Olympics type event for wolves, and forces Maggie to take a hard look at herself. I like the writing, I like the story, the sex talk seemed forced and some of it even seemed slightly out of character. It's a very quick read and very similar to the first two, so if you liked those you'll like this. Although it could be a stand alone too.",0
Good read could have been better there was no epilogue and I wish there was one. And the H was kinda a jerk throughout the whole book he thought the h was lying to him even up to the last 4 pages of the book but he still wanted her believing she was a scheming liar. Any way the a HEA but you don't really get the details. But I was a nice story line.,0
"Not alot of violence or cursing.  I enjoyed the book and liked that the crew were tight friends.  No betrayal in part 1 although I feel that a couple of the members of the crew are going to set him up.  Lartesha is a ride or die chick.  I like the story line although it moved so slow, I still wanted to find out what was about to happen.  I like the book because it didn't make my blood pressure rise.  It was more fit to become a sitcom on TV because of the innocent story line.",1
And my but is very personal: I just don't want to get to know the main character who lays beside his wife in bed imagining how he could kill her with the knife he holds.  Don't need it.,0
"I liked this book, even if the begnning did drag. The emails, in the end, helped build the relationship between them. Kelly and Jae knew each other better than they thought they did thanks to those emails, otherwise I would be saying the sex and &#34; love you's&#34; came too fast. Something that was pointed out in another review was that Kelly took advantage of Will's past. Yes, Will was abused but Kelly didn't know about it until after sex had pretty much stopped between them. Also, Will mentioned wanting someone to &#34;save&#34; him, and maybe Will saw Kelly as that person and found comfort and not resentment in the nature of the relationship.I would have liked to see more of Jae's family, just for te humor of all of the angry Asian women he talked about... would have lightened up the book some. It had its angst, but nothing I felt was overplayed. The feelings were organic.I did become slightly... fed up with the on-again off-agin part. One thing would arise and one of them would run off, and a few weeks later they were together again... maybe three or four times. It got a little old.I did enjoy the humor of the book, though Will's title as &#34;all around slut&#34; was a little too raw.The characters were all ther own, and I absolutely loved Will. Would love to see a sequal involvng his father and Kevin.",1
another good paper to read and read a lot in these parts also. i read it when i can to get the info from all around.,1
"Tryon is caught up in mating heat.  He's desperately needed to navigate the ship, and is one of the few species that can sucessfully navigate through the astroids.  While he's in this state though, he can't help any one.  The only thing to do is get him a temporary mate...Calla knew from the first moment she saw Tryon that she wanted him.  When he went into heat, she was the first one to raise her hand to help.  Even though she is also a Tyger, she has no experience with heat, and soon finds herself with more than she may be able to handle.The story line is definately something I was attracted to.  This is an Erotic story, so if you are looking for a light romance, it's not the story for you.  There is a lot of sex of course, because after all, Tyron is in heat, and that's what he needs.Calla and Tryon do have chemistry, but for me it wasn't enough to see them together long term.  The bomb seemed more of a distraction than anything, and I don't think there was enough time spent developing the relationship between the two main characters.  That's really why I gave this story three stars, I also felt that it was a bit choppy in the writing style.  This writer does show a lot of promise though, so I will keep an eye out for her later books.",0
"This fantasy tale is short, touching and creative. The two main protagonists, both spirited and a tad bratty at times, won me over in the end - I did not question their bond in spite of their differences. This author definitely understands the concept of building an atmosphere and ""showing rather than telling"" - kudos!",1
"This review is a bit contradictory because what I loved about this story, made it quite lacking at well.*SPOILERS*The excerpt does a good job describing the story and how the hero (Xenos) was throughout the book, I loved that he was an alien crossbreed who looked and behaved like it. So many times, I've read the 'lazy- I-don't-want-make-my-audience-uncomfortable-version' of sci-fi romances where the only things alien about the characters are their names and customs!nLike the excerpt states, Xenos is jaded and hardened emotionally and I like that the author remained true to that definition of who he was. He grew up in a lab where he was tortured, experimented on, and reared where he never had any positive emotional contact with anyone. And, because of how he looked, he was always on guard with everyone. Moonlight entered the picture, offering him her body for her mother's freedom, but she was disgusted and revolted by who he was and how he looked. Sure, her body responded to him sexually even though she hated, but he knew how she felt, so beyond the physical demands of his body, his overwhelming purpose was tied to his mission to defy his leaders and to stop the breeding and testing in the labs. So building on the sexual desire, Moonlight became interested in the Xenos the person. Now some readers might see her interest as being one-sided as she made most of the overtures in the relationship, but while I do get that sometimes as readers we want to see reciprocity to 'even' a relationship, in this case I understood why it couldn't be so. To accept the relationship, you had to remember who Xenos was, how he grew up and the events that shaped his life. He never knew love, tenderness,acceptance, or even a relationship and he also was insecure therefore all approaches had to come from Moonlight. Moonlight was strong in that she didn't need the scorecard. I thought that she took responsibility for the fact that SHE wanted him and in her internal dialogue, we see she accepted the challenges and came with being with someone who was so closed off.That being said, I think the author missed the mark with Moonlight's overall development. I didn't feel like I knew enough about her and it made her character a tad bit underwhelming.The story also focused too much on the rebellion/mission and even though Xenos and Moonlight's relationship was developing, it was merely based on their sexual compatibility. Every time they came together, it was about sex. This is my contradictory peeve, because while I like how focused the author was on maintaining Xenos character, the story ultimately is a romance, and there could've been a little more on the romance side without necessarily jeopardizing the storyline. Also, the sex scenes were very repetitive...in fact, after the first one, every other scene felt like it was cut and pasted with just a word change here and there. Xenos basically did the same things, Moonlight gasped the same words over and over!!There are a few graphic elements that a potential reader should be aware of. It's not too crazy or overly descriptive, but it is there.Finally, the end of the book left much to be desired. I felt like the author was detached from the romance side and it showed through in the end. Nevertheless, its a book that I recommend!",0
Lindsey is tired of being used by men so she swears off them until she meets Brad. Lindsey was offed a position to renovate a room for sex in a hotel. She has no limits on what she can do with the room. Lindsey is ready to create her ultimate fantasy and Brad is just the man to help her. He is hired to help with the construction portion of the room but one look at Lindsey and he would like to be renovating other things as well like her and him together. Brad has his own insecurities about woman and most people in general he has big dreams that he has never gotten any backing in. This is a great book to read about an in charge woman giving up control to a man who doesn't usually take it because he is not sure if he will be rejected. The are a great pare that burn up the pages and learn that if you open up just a little then true love an truly find you.,1
"Since my father passed away in 2006, I have been looking for comfort finding stories shared by those who've had near death experiences and came across this book. I take comfort in knowing that others have seen and heard signs of their loved ones communicating with them after passing. I experienced some of this myself, initially quite often, now rarely, but it is such a wonderful feeling when it does!",1
"Love the Out of Uniform stories.  Good, quick reads.  Highly recommend to all erotica fans out there.  This is a good series.",1
It just wasn't good. I'd say it was written by a teenager after her first lesson of creative writing. And those pitiful sex scenes! Really not worth reading.,0
did not like how they had one of the girls all cracked out and losing her kids a basic book about strippers. Read this too many times. Did not like it. Sorry,0
Well written. Interesting to see Sideous (through Maul) maneuvering events to fit his plan. We see human nature at work. But no good guys to root for. Even Rurit is a helpless pawn.,0
"PRAY FOR US SINNERS is a nice, tight little mystery with what I found to be a quite unexpected climax, which I certainly appreciated.  I purchased this Kindle book because I especially enjoyed its prequel, SAINTS PRESERVE US, and the very flawed--like all of us!--Catholic family which are its central characters.  Unfortunately, in PRAY FOR US SINNERS' very last chapter, an epilogue of sorts, the reader learns that the main character, Ronnie, has unapologetically made a particularly poor decision which includes behavior inappropriate from a Catholic standpoint, not to mention its being a rather illogical development according to the story's details up to that point.  This ruins the book for Catholic readers who often search high and low for recreational reading that respects a Catholic lifestyle as something normal, instead of something psychologically and/or socially deranged.  (The disappointing bits of the final chapter may be the inspiration for the book's title, though, I suppose.)  I guess the author simply couldn't once again resist the pressure to cater to the whims of the secular culture.I am especially unhappy that, because of the last chapter's inclusion of new details concerning Ronnie's lifestyle decision, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to any of my close friends (or their teen-aged children), as I so enthusiastically did SAINTS PRESERVE US.There were a few copy and continuity errors, but otherwise, I don't think there is anything to excite the grammar police.",0
I tried to read it and finish it but I just couldn't!!!  This book was awful!  The lead character was not interesting..too whiny & pathetic.  I didn't like the plot it was sooo weird!!!  I didn't read the reviews before I purchased it because I was in a hurry....Never again!!!,0
"Deleted from my kindle after just the first chapter.  This was the weirdest, creepiest romance I've ever read.  I can understand one man with multiple wives, but one wife to four brothers.  UGH!",0
Oh I cried through this whole story. You can feel the pain and anguish and the joy and love. Definitely this book is now in my favorites setTeachakidd,1
"This review is split into two sections. The first section has to do with the subject matter and how it is presented. The second has to do with how it was formatted for Kindle.Part 1I picked this up for my Kindle because I teach The True Story of Hansel and Gretel. The main characters in the book flee from the Bialystok ghetto, and it is difficult to find detailed infromation.Midler's story almost seems designed as if it was something he told and then typed, which is possible because he did present to a class in CA. This makes the style at times slightly disconcerting, especially towards the end of the book. Midler chronicles his life during the war, as the only member of his immediate family to survive as well as his experiences during the birth of Isreal, his travels to the United States, and his return to Europe. The book not only allows the reader a view into not only the war but into the current situtation in the Middle East. Not only that, but Midler ties the events into current events.Part 2However, the reason why I gave it three stars instead of the four it deserves is that the Kindle edition is very badly formatted. There repeatitive FFFFFFFF (multiple letters), huge chunks of paragraphs are repeated and chapter headings sometimes appear in the middle of sentences. This doesn't happen on every page, but it happens enough to be very, very annoying. The formatting lets down the importance of the story, for this is something that should be read and should be used in schools.",0
I have the whole Desert Rogues series and it is awesome. The men are all alpha males the women are are all strong and well written. A must read.,1
I did enjoy thus book but do wish I had read it in its correct order. It explained a lot that I didn't understand about the book that came after,1
"This started out pretty good, but by the end, I felt some of the leaps in the story were simply weak. It was a good read, with good character development, but it lacked complexity. Many people may not care, as it's a novella, but I felt it could have offered more in the way of filling plot holes instead of glossing over them for a pat ending... to be fair, I believe this is a prequel, but it still didn't offer enough to satisfy my need to know.",0
"The story wasn't bad.  I read the whole thing just to see how it ended, even though I think I already knew.  But the character Knghthorse was a child in grownups clothing.  Also, he was a big headed jerk.  He thought he was sooo great!!  Anybody who could have standed him must have been nuts.  I would have at least tried to knock him down some pegs.",0
"I felt like I had to trudge my way through the first few pages, this being before I knew it actually had (two) chapters. And within the first chapter, I literally had to force myself to read it, I fought the temptation to start skimming through it. But I could not offer quality review if I did, so grudgingly, I found chapter two.How the writer managed to cram three, maybe four erotic scenes into the first chapter, is beyond me. The first one was like, &#34;They could have done better&#34;, The second was a bit like the first, and the third was like a combo of the first two. Nothing new stirring the pot for these guys, they are just going through the motions after 500 years.I would imagine these guys just got tired of trying new things, and are just sticking to a routine.The story kicks into gear in the second chapter, finally.If I had known this, I would have skipped directly to chapter two. But even then, it still would have been a waste of time, because the story, at this point began to feel rushed, and there was little information given. So figuring out what was going on was completely lost. And then the next thing you know, it's over. So much for a story.I can't say this was the worst NN I have read.... Wait a minute. Let me re-phrase that.... This is not one of the worst, but it definitely is not one of their best. But I guess there is a reason they are offering certain books for free. And it's clearly not to get you into their collection, in hopes that you'll want to buy. NN's are a hit and miss, so I would not be likely to pay for any of them.",0

"I appreciated the sub themes in this Steele series:  smoking, high blood pressure, abuse, obesity,divorce. I gave it a three because of some of the primary themes. Kylie and Bas Steele for example. Kylie spends her whole life learning her Dads business, resents Bas coming in to help run it, then turns around and sells it two months after her dad dies when she realizes she loves Bas and wants to follow him back to Charlotte. Then Vanessa's reason for not trusting Cameron in the last book was weak at best. His job? Also didn't like the ending of Vanessa Steele's story. It went against the character buildup of Cameron being strong and the controller of his world for the story to end with him huddled in a basement waiting for a rescue.  He's a Texan!  I Would have preferred a rescue scene or one where Cameron hid her away then grabbed his shotgun (you don't live on a 10 acre ranch without one) made a cell call to his friends and then went out and took care of business in a Westmorelands/Madarises kind of way. This series is very corporate America. Needs a bit more rugged maleness and excitement.",0

"This book has many twists and turns that keep the reader guessing. I liked that the author tied together all of the character's relations at the end of the book to show how intertwined the story was. Although the main plot was excellent, I still found it hard to concentrate on the book because it seemed like the author wasn't going anywhere. I understand why this book is a classic and I am glad that I read it.",1
It wasn't all that. It could have used some more story to it. I like to read books that I can either relate to or that has a story to it that will keep me interested. This book just didn't do it for me. It started out good but it didn't end like it should.,0
"Purchased this for my husband, who totally enjoyed it, could not put it down.  One of Jules Verne's best books.",1
"This is a very well done book for the 99 cent price.  Story is fast paced, characters are well developed.  It appears to be well edited compared to many others in this price range.  I didn't notice typos or grammer issues.  I do have to complain to the author about his calling or describing 60-year old characters as elderly, wrinkled, etc.  As an energetic, active 60-year old, every time I saw one of these descriptions, I laughingly harumped and said to myself, this author must be very young to think of 60-year olds in this manner.  In all, you get a couple of days of light entertainment for only 99 cents.",1
"This was my first book by this author so I was lost on some of the background of the character's, since this is part of a series.  Had a lot of action, and I felt for the character's.  But, this book is way to short to be charging for $2.00 for.  (ljb)",0
This an exciting collection to read and I enjoyed it very much and highly recommend it to any and all sci-fi fans out there,1
"Rune witch, Noelle, and Chaos Pagan, Wynn, are definately hot for each other. The attraction and the sex are still ablaze after five years keeping the need for condoms all over the house high. Knowing the power of their sexual heat, Wynn brings home a book on sex magick that will allow the two of them to harness their sexual energy and use it to cast spells.Sounds great doesn't it?Sadly, the story isn't much longer than what I just wrote. It was a ten minute read. Definately a short story. Don't expect a novella. There just isn't enough there to justify my time or the two bucks. Heck, for five bucks I can have a three hundred page novel.So, maybe you are just in the mood for a good, sexy read. Not so much. Yep. They have sex. Most of the pages are rife with sex, but it is vanilla and frankly saying that it is 'hot sex' doesn't make it hot sex. Deets help. Maybe a little stamina? Maybe a little experimentation out of the box?? Heck we are talking pagans here right? Pagans that have been together for 5 years.More than anything I felt like it was an education on magic and casting. It seemed like there were more details about the casting of the spell than the act.I hate to give anything less than 3 stars.  This is a great idea. It just needs to be developed. I don't even think it is worth a free read on a blog. It just doesn't seem finished.",0

I read through more than half the poems to give it a chance, and I found perhaps one that was worthy of being published.  I would give this a pass.",0
"Gabe wasn't a dominant, he was just a jerk. Seriously, folks, this man/cat doesn't have enough will or juice to tell his new boss where to stuff it, but he has enough to dominate Sarah? There is a word for those who can't stand up for themselves in their professional lives and so come home to stomp all over those at home, and that word IS NOT ""romantic"" or ""charming"" or even ""desirable.""His domination was supposed to be all for her pleasure, but where is his consideration for her pleasure, her heart, her feelings, her peace of mind, ANY OTHER TIME?!? He was going to make this decision, but he didn't even really consult Sarah. While he is gone, he sounds off over the limited communication time he has to another woman. He comes back and expects her to fall into his arms in a very, ""where's my supper, wench,"" sort of way. He gets jealous, but doesn't understand that she might be have feelings, too, like, say, jealousy over the other woman he has talked to more than he talked to her. Disregards her in decision-making, controlling, displays a complete lack of understanding of her feelings...hmm, still not spelling ""good husband material"" to me.Warning lights are flashing everywhere for me, but, as usual for paranormal fiction, the ""destined mate"" card trumps all, so we are supposed to buy their HEA? Not me! I am sensing nothing but a restraining order, and since he is the sheriff, Sarah might be fleeing to Petal, Georgia and the arms of one of Lauren Dane's Chase brothers. She'd be a lot safer.

"Let me begin by saying this is one of the most fascinating books I have read in some time. I believe this would make a great movie, and I've even got the actor picked out!Other reviewers have described the plot so there is no need for me to go there.  The only reason I did not give this five stars is because of the numerous misspelled words, incomplete sentences, and other grammatical problems which were terribly distracting. After finishing the book I looked at the credits and saw this was originally published in 1995.  This obviously means the Kindle version was somehow translated from the printed version and these mistakes are hopefully not replicated in print.  The Kindle version is an atrocious one and badly needs to be revisited by somebody.",1
"The first few chapters held my interest. I liked that the h/h couldn't stand each other and was expecting some real fireworks. Never happened - at least up to the 50% point when I just gave up. Didn't find much to like about Tristan or Izzy. Their relationship was so slow moving and frustrating. The scene in which they first kiss had me so irriated. Izzy is just so sure that she won't know how to go about kissing the man she really wants to marry. Of course, Tristan has to 'teach' her that she'll know even though he doesn't like her and wants to marry someone else. I hate scenes that are so contrived. This is the only book I've read by Della Jacobs. May try another down the road.",0
"This book deals with an issue that I have never come across before in a romance novel. That is the infidelity of the heroine. Usually in romance novels, its a real turn off to find out either the hero or the heroine had strayed to 'greener pastures'. Most of the time rather than actually actually committing the act of infidelity, there is a misunderstanding between the hero and the heroine which is always later resolved in the novel. However it is not the case in the story of Katie and Cutter.In the first book of this series which I didn't read but was able to make out what happened by reading this book, Katie sleeps with Justin Cruz, now husband of Cutter's sister Dani Standifer. Although Katie was in a relationship with Cutter at that time, no matter how wrong infidelity is, Katie was feeling vulnerable and alone cos Cutter wouldn't really open up to her and give her what she needed.Katie has regretted sleeping with Justin from the moment Cutter finds out what happened between the two. Resolving never to let Katie into his life again, which is a bargain he has held till now, seeing Katie gatecrash Dani's wedding party is the last straw for Cutter. Thinking Katie had come to mourn over Justin, Cutter treats Katie like trash and takes what he has always wanted from her. Katie gives herself to Cutter thinking that she might get a second chance to work things out with him if she lets him have his way with her.These two embark on a purely sexual relationship, the consequence of which renders Katie pregnant. I felt that this story was too rushed and thus the resolving of the conflict between Katie and Cutter didn't quite give the satisfaction that I was craving as the reader. This story would have been much better and a more memorable one if the author had taken time to actually develop Katie and Cutter's characters a bit more and resolve the trust issues Cutter had with Katie in a more believable manner rather than just all of a sudden confessing that he loves Katie and wants her to be his wife.Anyhow okay for a quick read that doesn't require much thinking on the reader's part.",0
I love this author but not sure what was going on here. It felt like a chapter not a short story.  Disappointing,0
"This is the second book by Ms. Scudiere that I've read, and what has struck me the most is how different her books are from one another. This not only applies to plot lines and characters, but also to pacing and style. She created a new, wholly different reading experience with this book compared to the last one I read.What drew me in immediately were the two main characters, Lee and Cyn (or Sin, as she is also called). They are brutal yet endearing killers out to get revenge for the wrongful death of family members. They are cold at first, hard for the reader to understand, but this soon changes. When they finally begin to work together, as a team, the way the author builds their relationship is worth the entire book. I was so amused by their interactions, taking this book from a plot-driven thriller to a deeper level.  The plot itself is fun, fast-paced (although it could have done with a bit of trimming of some fight scenes), and the reader feels in good hands as the author weaves her story together. There are many moments of tension, including sexual tension, which send the reader's heart beating just a bit faster. There is also a wealth of combat and self-defense research in these pages, obviously demonstrating the care the author took to be as accurate as possible with the violence.This is a fun story that I can recommend without issue. And I, for one, will be glad to immerse myself in Ms. Scudiere's future projects.",1
"Boatman's got style and vision. The vast majority of the stories in GOD LAUGHS WHEN YOU DIE are wildly inventive and unpredictable, cleanly written and forceful. Some of them will make you a little... uncomfortable. While the subject matter is deadly serious, there's a strange undercurrent of bleak, bleak humor here as well, the kind of humor you cling to when faced with ugly truths that can't be denied.The only thing keeping this from a 5 star review was the somewhat messed-up formatting. But despite that, I'm looking forward to more from this author.",1
"I read sixty percent of this book and it was a snoozefest! I love vampire adult fiction, but nothing happened in the first three quarters of the story. There is no romance, no action, and all they do is travel from one city to another by foot and stare longingly at one another. Waste of money.",0

"This was a very good debut novel from new direct-to-digital novelist Maia Underwood. I really enjoyed the concept of a disastrous future environment. Underwood imagines an America after an event has happened ""The Crash"" which basically was a financial failure.""... the global economy had crumbled, forcing the closure of many industrial... giants; and bringing the essential transportation and distribution of goods to a grinding halt. ... the old way of life began to disintegrate... global anarchy took root.... (2%).""It is in this environment that young Selena was raised, living with her parents on the run. Lucky for her, her mother was a nurse and her father an anthropologist, so she was able to learn survival skills from them, including becoming a leatherworker. After her parents have passed, Selena lives like a ghost in the shadows, deftly avoiding human contact. In the time of anarchy, other humans are a threat, not only because they would rob her, but could also threaten her virtue.Eventually she runs into Dan... the son of a Special Forces Unit Military Officer who ""convinces"" the young lady to come with him and join a small hidden community of nice humans who have banded together. Selena has been far too long without human contact and it takes her time to learn to grapple with the struggles of living with others but she eventually finds her place.As much as I enjoyed this novel... I'd say it was only good (not great) because it was marketed as a romance and it just wasn't very romantic. There is absolutely no POV from Dan, the hero, and the story is almost entirely from the perspective of Selena. Dan is silent and unreadable and for the most of the novel, since we're not told what he's thinking even from his inner dialogue, there is little to no interaction between the two characters. At the point that the heroine provoked the hero into chasing her (which is all they do... she runs, he chases... the one time he doesn't chase she's disappointed...) anyway, by the time the love scene comes I wasn't convinced the two had fallen in love or why. They'd literally exchanged only a few sentences to each other. Literally. I was also disappointed that the heroine said ""no"" and ""i hate you"" to the hero when they made love. Not very romantic. After this love scene, they resort back to having little interaction with each other until the end.Beyond that, I kept wondering where all the humans had gone. The Crash doesn't explain why there is mass loss of life. This novel read as though there had been a nuclear fallout or a plague or something... leaving only remnant humans to and large cities completely abandoned. The only explanation is that humans died off because they were so dumb... when the cans and food ran out in the stores after being ransacked, they just didn't know what to do. Somehow this just didn't seem right to me. The whole explanation for The Crash just seemed a little flimsy. Financial global failure? Hmmmm.But overall, the story was good and the price was right.Love scenes: 2Environment: American Southwest/ Future/ ApocalypticStory Themes: Tortured heroine, tortured hero, kidnapping, rescue, love/hate relationship, survival",0

"This was another great short story and I found the H to be drop dead gorgeous. The idea that the H had such a wicked reputation but in reality was an honourable decent guy, was a different touch. The author certainly had me believing that there was a connection between the H and h that went deeper than her merely wanting to be ruined by him. Nice story.",1

"I generally do not enjoy books that include drug addiction and prostitution so I was a bit turned off at first. But I started to read the good reviews and was definitely curious.  Wow! I was pleasantly surprised. The Blood that Bonds is a great vampire tale that is a solid blend of conflict, romance, and tragedy. Very captivating and original. The author did a great job with the seedy side of addition (did not take it over the top) and did a great job with the romantic aspects of the story (also did not take it over the top).  His version of vampirism took a little from the norm with some added interesting twists (which probably are not original but not popular in most supernatural novels). Although some did not enjoy his writing style- there were a few parts that I found bland hence the four stars- I found his writing to be infinitely better than most e-books that I have downloaded and I am looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.",1

"This is a pretty interesting Star Wars short story that took a little bit of time to get into it. When I did finally get into it, it was just about over with. Then when I go to the other short stories that are suppose to be in chronological order, while they are about the same subject with the same people, they do not follow the same story. Each one started a completely new story, I wish it would go along with the story instead of jumping years at a time. Also half of the book that you download is trying to get you to read an excerpt for a completely different star wars short story or novel. This can really get quite annoying. This is interesting to read and entertaining at some level, but try not to get attached to the story too much....",1
"This story has several themes I personally really enjoy in erotica or erotic romance: full-figured heroine, military hero, interracial relationship, and an element of coercion. Although the coercion is a small part of the story, and I wouldn't characterize it as hardcore or full-on, it is still there for me to enjoy. Now, I know this idea of coercion doesn't work for everyone, but Abby's seeking to appease Mason with her body was very hot to me.Plus, she really wasn't doing something she didn't want to do. She'd been resisting Mason for weeks, denying him at every turn, and I think this was a convenient reason for her to give in to her attraction to Mason. For his part, he sees this as an opportunity to force her to spend some time with him and to take a chance on him. And how she resisted this man for a month, I just do not know. A military alpha with that commanding presence, muscular body, beautiful brown skin, sexy bedroom eyes, and a total good guy all the way around-- What was the girl thinking?Abby does have her reasons for resisting him, and as she and Mason spend the weekend together, stronger feelings other than lust develop. This story isn't long; it's actually around 58 pages. There is lots of sex, but it's done the way I love sex to be done: super hot, well-written, with the sexy edge of an in-charge man, and with a very sweet emotional connection between h/H. While there is no 'I love you' moment, I definitely felt HEA was in store for this couple. I thought it was a hot read with one very yummy hero who was tired of taking 'No' for an answer. There's no way Abby's getting away from him now.",1

"I like paranormal erotica books, and I wanted to like this one - but I couldn't.  The plot did not make much sense to me.  I am not an expert on the subject, I'm just a reading fan, however I find it very hard to believe that anyone could fall in love while shackled to a wall with silver chains.  Not only does the prisoner fall in love, but so does the woman that is supposed to rescue him.  She can make love to him while he's chained, but she is too weak to rescue him.  There are a number of flaws in this book.  The plot is too weak too.",0
"(I would give this story a 2.5 stars and not 2 if I could)To start, I'll give some background on the story. Undergrad Freshman Jada Mae Channinng and Grad Student Aaron McKensie starts a strong friendship while attending Harvard and volunteering at a local community center. On the last day of the fall semester, the two can't deny the lust that's been mingling between then for months and finally gives in. The two continues their friendship through the months ahead but with Aaron working for his father's company in Europe and Jada working here way through school, the two lose contact.Four years later in Atlanta at a dinner party, Aaron and Jada reconnect on terms that aren't so well inviting. Much has changed in four years. Aaron who is often cited in the ""Wall Street Journal"" is now branching out his business in Atlanta to work closely with NFL team the Atlanta Falcons, is his own multi-millionaire and is in another relationship. Jada is now working her way through Graduate school to become an Educator while holding down two jobs. And oh yeah, she's the mother of Aaron four year old son, Joshua.Determined to make up for lost time with his ""new"" family, Aaron does everything in his power to show Jada he's in love with her and wants to be apart of his son's life. But as it may, coming from two families with very different backgrounds is holding them back from what they both want, or at least it's holding back Jada. Aaron's father, Alexander is unwilling to accept that fact that Aaron is not only a father but is in love with a lower-middle class African American women. Jada Mae's grandmother Candace is reluctant about Aaron because of her own prejudices against White men.But Aaron is willing to walk away from everything including his father, current girlfriend and the company to be with Jada and Aaron exclusively and it's up to him to prove just that to Jada.My personal take:I've read 3 other stories by Savannah J Frierson, and of the 4, this one was the most disappointing. I felt like I've read this story several times from other authors. It was kinda ""cliche-ish"" to me which was what disappointed me the most. I can't say this was a romance novel because there wasn't many romantic moments in the story. There was one intimate scene and I felt like it was severely rushed. SEVERELY rushed!The character development could have been better. There was one instance where Jada was called ""fat"" by a counterpart yet, no where in the story was her size ever mentioned until after this incident took place besides when it was mentioned how short she was compared to Aaron who also wasn't described very well. The character Jada came across being extremely whinny and her best friend Deshae was highly nosy! I felt like Deshae fit this stereotypical African American women too well and that bother me to know end. Actually, it got on my nerve to say the least.What I did like about the story was how well their son Joshua was incorporated.He seemed like an adorable kid.I won't say you shouldn't read this book because we all have different tastes, but if you've read previous work by Savannah, you might not like this story as much as say, ""Trolling Nights"", which is the best books I've ever read. I had certain expectation from Savanna after reading other books from her and this one fell extremely short of those expectations. I was just overall disappointed.",0

"A good short story for a reasonable price. Other reviewers have provided the story line, I'd add that I liked McTark's inventiveness in the sex scenes, with a tinge of exhibitionism. Good chemistry between Brian and Amber, their characters had enough depth to make me care about them. The misunderstanding between them was a little out of character for Brian, but you gotta have some angst tension for a good story. I could have used a little more background on Brian. How is a nice, hot, hunky, hung guy like Brian not married or at least involved?",1
"~* 3.5 Stars *~Jessamyn Carroll fled Pennsylvania with her infant son when her rich and powerful mother-in-law made it clear that she was expected to bring the baby into the family fold...a fold that Jess's deceased husband had escaped years before he'd met and married Jessamyn. Mommy dearest will stop at nothing to get her grandson back - absolutely nothing, and Jess has taken refuge under her maiden name in Konigsburg, careful to keep her whereabouts a secret from the long reach of her mother-in-law. But making ends meet is tough for any single mother. More so when she's got to keep her head down and watch out for any potential threat.Lars Toleffson is glad he moved down to Konigsburg after his two brothers, Cal and Pete, who are now both married and living happy lives with his new sisters-in-law. He's got willing baby sitters every time he turns around, but the stress of being a single father combined with his two year old daughter's...precocious nature (and the Mississippi is a small stream) is wearing on him. Now that his daughter's daily caretaker is moving, he's got to find someone else to watch her every day. Taking out an add in the paper for a new caretaker brings Jessamyn Carroll to his office.The pretty Jess stirs Lars' juices, but a horrendous previous marriage and debilitating divorce keeps him firmly hands-off. Jess is as pretty as new sin and great as a caretaker, but his juices are just going to have stew for a little longer. At least until a stranger asking odd questions shows up in a town that doesn't feel too warmly about strangers and less so about presumptuous questions just before Jess' home gets broken into - twice - and she gets assaulted by the perpetrator. Before Lars even realizes it, protective instincts he hadn't counted on heat those stewing juices to a boiling point.Welcome back to Konigsburg, Texas, tourist mecca and home to lots of quirky characters just a bit off from center. Since the Toleffson brothers showed up it's been one wild romance after another - and a true treat for happy readers everywhere. With each book, Benjamin has broadened and deepened the world of Konigsburg and the characters who populate it, improving stylistically with each turn. From a technical standpoint, I think Be My Baby is the most well rounded and developed of all the books, with a detailed plot, appealing, endearing characters, a steady, flowing narrative, and realistic dialogue, thoughVenus in Blue Jeans: Konigsburg, Texas Book 1still wins my vote for the highest level of quirky character fun and humor.The most serious of the first three books, Jess and Lars both have pasts that have scarred their hearts and impacted their daily lives, and tragedy has struck Jess in particular very deeply. The humor is more subtle and intermittent than in the previous books, though Konigsburg's finest still shine bright. Overall, the story maintains a nice balance between humor and suspense, and there are far fewer gaps in plot, timing, and transition than in the previous books in the series. I did, however, feel the ending was too slick and quickly wrapped up, with all the secondary plots threads getting tied off too cleanly. Lars' ex-wife Sherice, for example, went from being a plot thread to a footnote with jarring abruptness given the way that thread had developed. It was exceptionally anticlimactic, especially as I was hoping to finally see her get what she so richly deserves.Still, I think Be My Baby is the most technically and stylistically well written and developed. Even with that, though, it's not my favorite of the Konigsburg books, for strictly subjective and personal preference-based reasons. In the end, I just wasn't as fond of Lars as I was of Cal and didn't think he had quite the scope of development through the story arc of book that Pete had in his. I liked him, but there just wasn't much about him that made his character really stand out for me. I felt similarly of Jess, but had the added problem of questioning her intelligence and logic in more than a few places. Maybe that's not something I should blame Jess for, but when she repeatedly turned down a safer haven closer to town because of her primary job and the promise she made to the vacationing owner, but contemplates just up and leaving town entirely when she fears her mother-in-law is closing in, I questioned her decision making. You can't move into town because of prior commitments...but leaving town is fine? That issue in particular seemed too much like author's choice to get the plot to a certain point, instead of organic character action. I also had a problem with the development of the romance between Lars and Jess. I read of their growing affection for each other and their hot little lust moments, but I never really felt there was any real fire behind it. I couldn't get fully on board with the romantic aspects of the relationship because of it.I also had sort of an odd problem with Lars' daughter, Daisy. I freely admit that I have no kids and almost no experience with two-year-olds, but her dialogue and actions seemed to me to be advanced beyond her age and it kept tripping me up when she was in a scene. I could be totally off base with the cognitive and verbal abilities of a toddler, or she could be an atypical child, I know and acknowledge that. But even so, as I was reading, the issues I had distracted me when she was in the scene.For those reasons, Be My Baby wasn't my favorite in the series, even though I recognize it's a more complete and balanced book with a more fully formed and realized plot. What hasn't changed, though, is my appreciation for Benjamin's Konigsburg, Texas series as a whole and my anticipated delight in reading the story of the final, and for me the most intriguing of the Toleffson brothers, Erik. Going hand in hand with the continuing improvement of the series, Erik is the most damaged and layered of all the brothers and the juxtaposition of those two things provide tremendous potential for a meaty, fun book. I can't wait to read his story inLong Time Gone: Konigsburg, Texas Book 4.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",1

"What a frustrating read! It started out really good. It began with years ago with young wizard Jaxon being admonished for trying to take control with his magic and he is taken under the wings of the wizard leader, Falcon. Then in the present day, apparently Jaxon has integrated into the human world under the guise of a building contractor. Rich girl Tess accompanies her BFF Belinda to an auction...but unbeknownst to Tess, the auction is for men or rather a date with them. Belinda already has bought a date for Tess which happens to be Jaxon. When the two meet, sparks fly and there is instant attraction! Tess fights her attraction to Jaxon and she senses that he's different from the usual men she meets. Lo and behold, magical Jaxon uses his charm and the two of them fall fast into bed. Well....there interaction is sizzling...Tess is swept off her feet and is sucked into the world of magic with Jaxon. Jaxon is called back home because there is a threat happening with their dreaded enemy, the coven of witches who want to rid their world of the wizards because they are holding the witches back from ruling the world.Ok...Tess reluctantly begins her adventure in the wizard world because she loves Jaxon and wants to be with him but she comes to find that Jaxon, although a super lover, is also very controlling and chauvinistic. He does things for the safety of Tess without consulting her and this really upsets her. Anyway, while they battle over his controlling ways, he is also up to his neck in the oncoming witches' threat with the leader being Athena. Along the way, he is also informed by the lead wizard, Falcon, that the leadership of the assembly of wizards will be passed on to Jaxon....which means more responsibility.My main problem is that there are too many rules and procedures in the world of wizardry. If the wizards are so powerful, why can't they stop the threat coming from the witches? Why, when they had several times to kill Athena, they didn't? That would have ended the threat right there and then! As for Athena, I know she is in the 3rd book of this series but seriously, I could find no redeeming qualities in her to warrant a story for her own. I don't know why Jaxon's brother is in love with her because all she comes across is a selfish, power-hungry witch...and I mean a witch literally! I did NOT like her at all in the story. And Braeden comes across as an idiot for loving her. I hope they explain why she is the way she is and seriously redeem her evilness in the 3rd installment. If they had killed Athena I would have given this book 5 stars. Let's see how her story plays out. Oh yeah...lots and lots of sex between Jaxon and Tess in this book...and I mean LOTS!",1

"This is Jules Verne's attempt at writing a Robinson Crusoe / Swiss Family Robinson castaway story, with the twist that the five castaways crash-land a balloon and thus come to the island with almost nothing -- unlike Crusoe or the Swiss Family, the castaways here don't have a boat-full of resources, tools, etc., to fall back on, and have to make *everything* themselves, from the ground up, armed only with their knowledge of science and engineering. Since it always seemed to me that Crusoe and the Swiss Family cheated a bit by bringing so many tools and so forth along with themselves, I really enjoyed the more scientific focus, and this has now replaced Swiss Family as my answer to the ""what one book would you want with you on a desert island?"" question.Parts of the novel drag a bit, but it's a Jules Verne novel so there's a good story here -- the Island has a mysterious unseen inhabitant, also, there are pirates, which is always awesome.The main flaw is that this is based on the 1875 Kingston translation, which makes a fair number of edits on Verne's original -- for example, it changes some of the protagonists's names and removes some of Captain Nemo's anti-imperialist, anti-british rhetoric. There's a more accurate translation available for free in the Kindle store, so I'd recommend grabbing the accurate version instead (look for the edition where the engineer is named Cyrus Smith, rather than Cyrus Harding;  Kingston reportedly felt ""Smith"" was a ""gypsy name"" and hence unsuitable for a heroic character. You can find that version in the kindle store here:The Mysterious Island)Oh, yeah, Captain Nemo. This book is in some ways a sequel to Verne's _Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas_, as well as to his _In Search of the Castaways_. The sequence isn't direct -- really more a case of cameo characters than a direct plot sequel to either book -- but you might want to read those two books first before picking this one up.",1

Love shifter stories and i really liked this one.  What's not to like? Homely girl gets the super hot guy and pisses off the local diva.  Great stuff.  The only thing is that the ending was rushed and the story was too short.,1
"Melina Wenham doesn't think her live-in boyfriend, Gavin, is cheating on her.  At least, he says he's simply trying to finish a massive project at work and doesn't have any energy once he returns home. Still, that's no reason for him to completely ignore the new lacy bustier or her hot Brazilian way job.  When he does make time for sex, he either falls asleep in the middle of the act or opts for his own solo sessions.  If he's not cheating on her, then he's obviously lost interest in her.  What's a girl to do?At a friend's housewarming party, Melina confesses to a friend that there's trouble in paradise.  Knowing that Melina would never flirt with another man just to make her boyfriend jealous, Abby instead suggests that she flirt with another woman--her.  Flirting soon becomes much more and when Gavin walks in on the two women locked in an intimate embrace, will he finally realize that he's been neglecting his pretty girlfriend or will the girl-on-girl scene be too much for him to handle?Love Me is a well-written, blisteringly sexy short story by author Kelly Jamieson. It explores the fantasy many women have of loving another woman, even if for only one night.  The concept of daily living getting in the way of intimacy and paying attention to one's mate is hardly an unrealistic concept.  However, while flirting with and acting upon a flirtation with someone of opposite sex is considered infidelity in this story, it seems to showcase the message that sex with a same-gender partner is not.Having read other words of lesbian or bi-sexual romance, I was looking forward to an entertaining read. I have to say I was a bit disappointed by the cavalier way that infidelity was handled. Fully recognizing that this is a work of fiction, I still had difficulties believing that these two people could not communicate to each other their own wants and needs.  What's more, due to that lack of communication, under the guise of making her boyfriend jealous, the heroine went to another woman to have them met, even if the encounter began as a simple flirtation.Courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews ([...])",1
"I don't write plot summaries or include spoilers.I really enjoyed reading this book 2 of Ms. Arend's 'Granite Lake Wolves' series, which begins withWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1. Similar to book 1 in that this is a FAST read. Given that, it is pretty satisfying. Good book to read in an afternoon if you just want a little relaxing fun. It would almost be as comforting as a good cup of tea... or is it the other way around?Characters are sweet- more sweet than sexy in this case. Both Missy and Tad come across as people you'd like to have living next door. Despite the fact that I wasn't drooling over them or caught up in their passion, their romance was well done. There was some background between the two which helped provide some depth and their sexual tension was fun to watch unfold. I chuckled in places and sighed in contentment in others.This series does seem a little light on the paranormal side- you don't really get to spend too much time on the shifting or their nature as wolves, but pack politics come into play- and certainly wolf instincts. This book had a bit more magic in it given that the Omega wolf was a key part of the plot.All in all, it's a light, uncomplicated paranormal romance series. Something to read for fun when you have time. It is light and romantic enough to be soothing. I will save the next one for a day when I need a little escape.FURTHER READING: if you like this, you'll like...Moira Rogers' basic werewolf romance series:Cry Sanctuary: Book 1 of Red Rock Pass seriesR.G.

"I really can't say I loved it. It was good in parts and than slow and boring in others.  My biggest problem with the book I think has to do with the heroine. Yes, he abandoned her and so on but after he explains his reasons which were understandable you would think that the wife at some point would understand too, but nope,It takes 245 pages for this 2 to actually get together. After they finally get to lie together something else comes up and we have to read another 100 more pages for this women to forgive him again. The story and the idea is not bad the last 40 pages were quit good and romantic but before I reached those I actually struggled to continue reading.",0
"I really enjoyed this story. I would to have the author expand on this story. Particually, I like the anti-hero perspective. It's a new twist to the way most  historical romance novels are written. Sometimes you get a peak here and their in some stories, but this story keeps the reader in that mind frame through out the story, leaving the reader wanting more.",1

"And worth every penny I spent on it.  I suppose it's a pleasant-enough story in the Harlequin-romance vein. Don't count on much suspense here though.  It's mostly a story of a marriage of convenience becoming one of True Love.  Hero Jonas, who owns a bar in Key West, needs a wife so that it will look like he's providing a stable, ""traditional"" family life for his orphaned 5-year-old niece, whom he has cared for 3 years or so.  Heroine Pam is from Seattle, on the run from a killer who she believes wants to kill her so that she can't testify in his upcoming re-trial.  (She already had testified in his first trial.)  So she agrees to marry Joe to be able to change her name and hide out.  (Yeah, I know.  What a great idea.)Pam is an uptight architect, not used to children or a laid-back style of living.  We have her predictable evolution from prissy lady to Key West kind of gal and we see her maternal instincts eventually come out to deal with the 5 year old.  (A child who is far more advanced, verbal and aware than my grandchildren were at that age.  Well, maybe people in my family aren't very bright.) So we've got Pam's emotional makeover, the Joe-Pam love thing, and the hit man subplot (which is kind of subpar).  It's an OK read but isn't something you should pay for.",0
It is quite shocking that I didn't like this book because I read all the reviews before I bought it. I thought it was far too predictable and rather pendantic. So if I were you I would purchase something else.,0
"There was no romance. The story got set up for him to get paid to pretend to court her so that fortune hunters left her alone but then you were told that they spent time together. One second they are saying goodbye at her family function on their first outing and then it is weeks later and they are n love. Also, the author apparently does not know what last name she wanted for the heroines family. It was Barnswell, Barnes, Barnard, and I think a couple more which is ridiculous in a 25 page story. How can you not remember your characters' names??? Also there are proofreading issues. It was just a waste of money and time!",0
"You'd think I'd learn by now not to expect too much from free books. This particular story has the distinction of being both poorly edited and really annoying. The characters are all one dimensional, stupid, and and evoke no sympathy whatsoever. I kept hoping it would improve, but finally gave up 3/4 of the way through and deleted the book from my device. Out of the thousands of books I've read in my life, there have only been a handful I couldn't finish because they were just that bad. This one has the distinction of making that short list.",0
"I've enjoyed several of Ms. D'arc's other books so decided to try this series.  I'm definitely enjoying it!The idea of having the dragons mating tied to the knights finding a mate is a great idea. The world building is great, including the idea of a dragon society where humans and dragons work together to successfully and peacefully exist is wonderful!I did think the meet and have sex aspect was a little too rushed but, since this is: a short read; a different society and the author explained the love at first sight thing - it's okay.I liked the action and was eagerly rushing to read the next book - Border Lair.  I do not like the fact that some of the sub-story books have not been published yet but I guess I have to be patient.",1

It wasn't ground-breaking or something I'll remember for the rest of my days, but it was emotionally satisfying and just the kind of story I was looking for!Both the main characters are into sports, so being gay isn't something they feel they can be out about... even with each other.  As best friends and roomies, they spend a lot of time together and their games of ""gay chicken"" really made me laugh.I think this would be a great beach read or just a sweet romantic quickie to tide you over, especially if you have a male/male craving.  *wink*",1

"I found this story entertaining and much too short. The story opens with a couple who has been married for six years.  The wife suspects her husband of keeping a mistress after she finds a diamond bracelet in their drawers and then later finds out that she was not the recipient of said bracelet when bracelet disappears. He picked up the bracelet for his brother unbeknownst to his wife, so the misunderstanding begins.Armed with her suspicions, the wife feels she needs to shake up their marriage and win her husband back from the arms of the phantom mistress. The books begins when she announces over breakfast that she wants to take on a lover. Her husband is reading the paper and not paying attention to the conversation, agrees with everything she says.  She feels that after six years of marriage and two children, their marriage has become dull and is concern that her husband has or will look for a mistress to spice things up.The two still love each other very much, but marriage for them has become somewhat a rut after six years.  So what does this couple do? They go through the charade of finding her a lover. He tells her he wants to help select her lover. She agrees and then blackmails his twin brother to pretend to be her lover and pursue her anonymously. Her husband also seeks help from his brother to play the role of the lover and pursue her (but not bed her), so she does not have the time to seek another lover. Neither is aware that the brother is the only one privy to the dual roles he is playing.In the end, the husband realizes that he had been taking his wife for granted and has not lived up to his promises of giving her the adventure he spoke of during their courtship. He also admits to his brother and himself of recently developing a wondering eye and possessing a feeling of restlesstness  He knows that he has been neglecting her and not telling her how much he loved her and that he was the one  responsible for allowing their marriage to fall into a rut. He then likens his comfortable marriage to an untended garden. That was a good analogy.I thought this was a sweet story, but felt it could have been longer with more detailed flashbacks regarding their courtship. I only caught glimpses of the wonderment that she wanted to recapture from the days of their courtship. I like stories with married couples who are not fighting. One sticking issue with me is the reference of the wandering eye. If you are as in love with your wife as you claim to be - should you have a wandering eye?  I had to deduct a star for these references.This is the second novel I read from this author and I am very impressed with her writing abilities to capture details of the moment.A recommend.",0
"Cassandra Devon has been a romance reader since she was young.  Interestingly enough she seems to prefer the ""bodice ripping"" stories of the 70's and their swashbuckling heroes to today's offerings.  This leads to a number of daydreams for this fanciful woman, and she does tend to lose herself when she is in the midst of them.What will happen when she dumps her latest guy (no hero material there) and heads to the islands to meet up with her best friend?  She hasn't counted on being confronted with the Irishman who doesn't seem to want to listen to her rebuffs, or his best friend the sexy Raphael, who seems interested.  But what happens when Connor seems to start taking Raphael's place in her daydreams?While Ripping the Bodice was a fun and tongue in cheek look at not only romance but the older ""bodice ripping"" romance books of the 70's, it wasn't as fantastic as I had hoped it would be.  I thought Ms. Lavey rushed parts of the story and in some cases spent too much time on the daydreams of Cassandra.  I did find the characters to be fun and well developed and the premise of the story hilarious.  So while I didn't find Ripping the Bodice a keeper for me I will be sure to check out Ms. Lavey's future stories.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"I'd never read a sci-fi/romance blend before, and let me tell you, I didn't know what I was missing!  The chemistry betwen the hero and heroine, as well as the action, had me on the edge of my seat for the entire book.  Hope to see many more of these types of books from Cathryn!",1
"I have been enjoying Mr. Rain's books but this one is the exception. The first half was OK and had me suitably captured. Then I ran into, what I consider to be, a fatal flaw. Mr. Rain did a drastic POV change. As with all his other books, this one started out in first person. Half way through the book he started sections of third person POV in order to follow Faye, the heroine/love interest. Further along he split again to Farid""s POV in order to show the fight between Farid and Kaseem. I'm sorry, but I just felt that this was poor writing practice. There is nothing wrong with changing POV as such, but going from first to third along with that---not good!I also had trouble suspending disbelief on some of the mountaineering in this book. I don't think Mr. Rain knows or cares about such realities as hypothermia. I also found the helicopter sequence unbelievable. A helicopter is much more complicated to fly than a fixed wing. Having the girl just hold the cyclic doesn't cut it.The character of Sam Ward seemed like a very watered down version of Jim Knighthorse. I didn't feel like Sam was his own character, so to speak.Hopefully, Mr. Rain will continue to write books about his Vampire Detective and Jim Knighthorse. Those I look forward to.",0

"I just finished reading Saddled by Delilah Devlin and can't believe I just read the same story that other Amazon readers did.  The reviews this story received peaked my interest and I decided to give this book a try.  What a disappointment!  The characters were so poorly developed that I had to make up my own vision of what the character Bobby looked like.  Kate is a young woman who is preparing to wed a rich, successful man that she obviously is not in love with, but, whom she feels will offer her security.  When she discovers him cheating on her, in their bed, at a ski vacation retreat she leaves him and promptly drives the car into a ditch.  Along comes Bobby and Cale, two former military guys who own a ranch together.  They pull her to safety and take her to bed to warm her.  As soon as she awakens, she decides they're hot, why not and gets it on with the two of them.  Their affair takes place over a week in which Kate falls in love with the two cowboys and they with her, although this has got to be the most unromantic affair I have ever read.  The plot to this story is so weak and thin as to be the most anorexic one I have ever suffered through.  I read many, many erotic books and this one does not deliver on any level.  I didn't care about the characters, I didn't believe their emotions and I was very glad I bought this title electronically.  I would suggest Amazon readers tryColters' Woman, because in that story some of the same circumstances exist with much better writing.  Sorry, Saddled will not be in my keeper collection.",0

"The Classmate Murders is a fun and clever mystery. The story is written mostly in narration style, which works perfectly with this main character. You can almost hear the character's voice as he tells the story and adds his own brand of humor.Jim Richards is a regular guy, who is mature, divorced, and living with his parents to help take care of his dad. When he finds his long-ago high school classmates are being murdered, he and his friends step in to try to find the killer and protect Penny, his new-found love. I have read many books with female civilians getting caught up in a murder mystery, but this time it is a man who noses his way into the action. The cops don't like it - until he comes up with some interesting clues. I enjoyed the variety and personality differences in the characters. It is also fun to read about people closer to my age.It is a reminder to younger people that love can bloom at any age, but I thought the romantic antics started to get in the way of the mystery. Eventually it got back on track and came through with a satisfying wrap up to the case.  I especially enjoyed the last part of the book that sets the stage for the following books.This is an enjoyable and distinctive kind of mystery.",1
"If I hadn't been reading this book on my kindle I would have torn it to pieces! This is one of those books where the villain gleefully tells his soon-to-be victem about his evil plan and, because he took so long gloating, was killed. And the heroine was so pathetic and annoying that I wanted her to die. All of that freezing in fear and fainting. Gag! Not only that, but, for a character who is supposed to be intelligent, she couldn't even figure out who the villain was when he was standing in front of her with a gun pointed at her. There was plenty more that I could complain about, but it annoys me just thinking about it!",0

I am going to continue with the series! Rent-boys are favorites of mine!",1
"I love erotica, I love BDSM elements and the idea of being forced, held down, etc. This was different because the woman in this story specifically liked a certain kind of sex and a horrible event messed that up for her. I commend her for trying to take her life back but the way she did it with the hero didn't make me feel like I liked her and I couldn't really enjoy the sex scenes. This was heavy and emotional and kinda weird. The way it is written makes it hard for me to accept what happened at the end but it is fiction and therefore anything is possible. If you are not sure how you feel about this subject I recommend to pass.",0

It may be free but don&#8217;t waste your time as you&#8217;ll never get that back I sure wont. To make it worse the female lead was a split personality that went from a battered, scared introverted woman who was petrified of her husband to an independent, confident woman who could take on the world from the smile of a complete stranger she immediately fell in love with. The silliest book & biggest waste of my time & don&#8217;t expect much Native American storyline added in, the name and cover were about as good as it got",0

"PJVs QUICKIE POV: I seem to be hungry as of late. {har har Primal Hunger get it???} For some reason my schedule has left me hiding under the covers with my kindle. Hence, all of the ebooks. Or was it my over-indulgence in YA? Had to jump out of the teenie-bopper realm and get me so down and dirty adult PNR. Whatever it is, I have fallen in love with Samhain Publishing and all of their paranormal picks. Primal Hunger is my latest conquest and it has me eager to read more of Somers' writings. An interesting concept, Somers pairs Arthurian legend with shape-shifters and gargoyles, didn't know this would make for smoking hot read...but isn't that what makes for great fiction?REVIEW: Kennedy, the hot bartender from Pendragon's with a sharp tongue and a penchant for trouble-making, has found herself in a situation. She's been hot for the co-owner for like forever, but he can barely stand her. So, when her car breaks down outside the club and he pulls up to assist her, she's not exactly wanting to be alone with him in fear that her hots for him might become evident.Tristan is the object of Kennedy's desires, but he is also a gargoyle shape-shifter and immortal to boot. He has been on a mission for a long time, to save his brother. He has no time for women, especially women like Kennedy. Why he stops he doesn't know - but instinct takes over and Kennedy is getting in his car - and then all hell breaks loose.Shot with a tranquilizer Kennedy has to save Tristan as they go on a break-neck run to save both of their lives. Doped up, with all inhibitions gone, Tristan finally lets his cat out of the bag and begins to seduce Kennedy - not like it was very hard. From that moment on, Kennedy's life will never be the same, hanging with immortals is not exactly good for a girl's livelihood.I really liked the concept of this book, I'm a sucker for Arthurian legend, even though it was just lightly touched upon. The book really didn't do much to explain a correlation between gargoyle cat shifters and the Knights of the Round table. But, this book actually did little explaining, because it really was more erotica than paranormal romance. So - Primal Hunger was smoking hot and a delectable kitty pounces unsuspecting human book, but again I would have liked to see more plot expansion. I feel I'm being critical though, because with the length of this novel and the story-line I believe it achieved what it set out to do - entertain and titillate.RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, this is an erotica novel. Fans of shifters should enjoy.",0
"As my fellow reviewers have already pointed out, this is a retelling of the O. Henry classicThe Gift of the Magi.  The extreme familiarity of the plot and the lack of tension between the main characters (they're married, they're happy, everything is great) make this a dull read.For those who like a story with a fuller figured female main (apparently the cattish aliens prefer big women), this may fit the bill.",0
"This story is the pre-quel to the Lords of the Underworld Series and can be obtained for FREE in it's entirety by selecting the free kindle sample for the Lords Of the Underworld Bundle (so save yourself the money).  It's not a great story, but it does provide the background to the series, and from what I've heard it is not reflective of the author's usual writing. It's worth reading (esp. for free) if you want the background info. Briefly the prequel tells the story of Kadence, the goddess of oppression, and Geryon the gaurdian of the gate of Hell. It's a short story that tells of their love and their quest to fortify the Gate/wall of Hell as well as the subsequent creation of Pandora's Box. The story is bitter sweet. The ending is a little off (anyone who knows anything about poisionous animals would agree - you'll understand if you read it - but it's paranormal fiction anyway, so whatever.). Also, if sex between a human-ish female and a demon male who is described as half animal (sort of like a Satyr) is repugnant to you, you may wish to skip this one. I also recommend getting the kindle samples for the individual stories as well, just to make sure you enjoy the author's writing style before or if you are considering not purchasing the ""Bundle"", since it is different from this short story. Reading reviews would'nt hurt either! Hope this one helped!",0
"Very good. Nicole Kimberling's writing is incredibly smooth and it gives a solid ground to a very enjoyable fantasy story set in a contemporary setting, but with a society based on a monarchy, with competing courts, servants and magicians.Drake is a powerful magician working as a free-lancer. He doesn't want to sell his permanent services to one of the courts and he also doesn't like to enslave souls as all the other powerful magicians do. On the night of the birth of the heir to the kingdom, he is summoned to retrieve an amulet and he meets the good-looking Adam, who doesn't hold an important position at court, but who would like to prove himself in life. The third protagonist is the melancholic Thomas Myrdin, who was the king's lover, and is now revealed he might hold powerful magic himself. These three men cross their paths and destinies on a fateful night and have to risk their souls and lives to protect their loved ones and the kingdom against the dark plans of another great magician.Drake is an honorable man, compassionate, caught in his magic, with little time for his personal life. Adam ignites Drake's desire. At the beginning Adam seems like a pretty pawn, sensual but shallow, but page after page he shows his courage and his stubborn determination, who brings him to do what he feels is right. I couldn't really see his connection with Drake at the beginning, it was difficult to read something more in their attraction, but hour after hour I could see their relationship become something deeper. I think the story could have worked beautifully even without a single sex scene. The encounter in the alley for example didn't really fit the story, in my opinion, and I felt there was more sensuality in the little signs of affection the protagonists showed to each other.The details of the world building were very beautiful. I liked very much the all concept of the soulless people, the way their souls were entrapped or returned, how the nature of their hosts reflected on them after their natural bodies were returned. There was a lot of understated humor. The action scenes were fast-paced and there was an overall balance of the different elements. The romance was there, but it was never the focal point of the story.Very entertaining and satisfying.",1
This was a great charming book .I really enjoyed how it starts with Aislinn as a little girl she has a big dream of becoming a lady knight. The story line follows her as a 7 year old child to young woman. She works hard to become a knight.  I really enjoyed the interaction of her and her friends Geoffrey and Caelan. This a fun coming of age read.Nicole really did alot of research for this book. A real page turner! I will be reading Woman of Honor again,1
"Sidney the female protagonist is outwardly hostile to Ben , she just doesn't seem to want the love that so clearly and grows in Ben's heart for her , and every act of kindness burns her like a brand. Intense anger over every man she meet and her overly negative actitude made her a unlikeable protagonist. The end was also extremely rushed and unrealistic.",0
I had great expectations of this book after reading some of the reviews but was greatly disappointed. It seems that the author takes too much care to set the atmosphere of the 19th century and it's customs that she does not give enough passion to the story. The whole story revolves around the pursuit of the main character towards his abandoned wife but there isn't any pleasure in the chase. I have to say I was rather bored when reading this book. It definitely held a promise but failed to keep it.,0

"Mark Twain can sure turn them out!  As I survey the somewhat forbidding vista of free books for my Kindle, I generally find that his books will actually be read.  This is a fun conceit about a riverboat captain who dies and travels to heaven, only to find that it is not what he expected.  Twain is not impious, but full of wit reminiscent of talk over the cracker barrel in the old general store.  Not long, but good.",1

"Morgan Crenshaw has wanted her boss since her interview and she has decided to make him see her as a sexy woman.  The new temping outfit she is wearing is nothing like her normal work clothes and she really can't stand the sting of the thong, but if this is what it takes...Ridge Casey is co-owner of an architectural firm and he is headed in today hoping to learn that they have won a new project bid.  When he gets into the office, two things give his stomach a punch.  The first is Morgan and her new outfit and just how many of the other men at the firm have seen her in it, and the second is that they were somehow outbid again.Ridge has no choice but to deal with Morgan and her sexy outfit since his pants are beginning to not feel so comfortable.  Today is going to be both the best and the worst for Morgan.  She gets everything she has always wanted and watches as it begins to disappear when she is suspected of being a saboteur.Between a Ridge and a Hard Place is fast-paced and extremely sexy.  Ridge has ignored Morgan for a year now and she is tired of watching his constant parade of women.  Ridge has wanted Morgan for the entire year she has worked for him, but she just hasn't given any signs of how she feels.  I loved it when Ridge saw Morgan and her new outfit for the first time and his immediate reaction to it.  From the way they exploded with each other, I'm surprised that they lasted a year.  While I will admit that I figured out the who did it part before it was announced, it was skillfully done.  Between a Ridge and a Hard Place grabbed me from the first paragraph and did not let go until I turned the last page.  I suggest a large bottle of cold water and locking yourself in a room because you won't want to be interrupted.  It goes without saying that I loved Between a Ridge and a Hard Place and, of course, it's Joyfully Recommended.JoReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"I thought this one was just silly.  I didn't dislike the story because it was short or underdeveloped.  That isn't the problem here.  I found the story well-developed for a short story and the conflict wasn't too complex.  Here I thought Genevieve to be silly and inconsistent as a character.  The romance wasn't believable and the situation Genevieve was in was...well...silly.  I wish I could go into more details but since my issue is with the plot and it's a short story, saying anything would give everything away.  Suffice it to say, Genevieve was not for me.",0
I am a real fan of Sci-Fi and of Frank Herbert.  His book Dune is one of the great classics of Sci-Fi.  This story is not up to his standards.  Frankly it was like he was being paid to write a story of so many words for a magazine and he suddenly realized that he needed to finish so the story quickly and abruptly ends.The story starts off well like one of Andre Norton's space interplanetary exploration teams making first contact with a new race.  The man assigned the task of making first contact knows the new race cannot be trusted and he knows that they have captured a space ship.  Suddenly within a few questions he solves the puzzle of where the ship is and turns the tables on his captor.  The story ends so quickly it makes you wonder why you wasted your time reading it.  It is only about 30 minutes of reading time so if you have an interest in the book then go ahead and enjoy it.  I am just glad that I didn't pay for the book.,0

"I was being constantly distracted from the story by the many silly mistakes the author makes which a little research could easily have prevented. For example, we have Barra (an island I know very well - many of my friends are Barraich) in the 16th century, but the boat is called Ceridwen. Ceridwen is a goddess from Welsh mythology and has nothing to do with the Western Isles. Then, we have a male warrior called Sileas. Sileas is, and has always been, a female name. And I could go on and on.. Absolutely infuriating.",0

"This was my first with this author. I thoroughly enjoyed it.I have to say the concept of dragon, elves and djinn being at war is new to me. Theres usually a truce in place. That elves and djinn team up to eliminate dragon mates, in an attempt to wipe out the dragon race was refreshing to read. Story wise I mean.Scarlet is a pop star. She has been in hiding for 7 years.Janos is a dragon. He is also an elder.Scarlet is his mate. Janos must protect her till he can impregnate her. Once that is accomplished he can change her thus giving her a way to protect herself.The story was too short. Only 90 pages. Still a lot was told in such a short space.

"I like the idea-- man in drag, some straight guy, then he realizes he's actually gay or converts someone else. Actually, I will read anything with this concept. The plot was faintly ridiculous however. Maybe it was always going to be, but waiting for the cops to bust a house-wife organized pot ring was a bit much. But hey, I read romance so I would have let it go if the characters were good enough.But, I actually found it faintly unpleasant that our hero knew so little about the guy he was shacking up with. The love interest was so subdued that I wasn't sure what he felt. The author attempted to fix this at the end by having the character say something like, 'you didn't say much but your actions spoke for you.' Oh brother.Sex scenes were not bad, but it was no Grey's Awakening, lemme tell you.",0
"This is actually a compilation of CI's How-To series. This was originally a couple of dozen small cookbooks including things like 'How to Make Cookie Jar Favorites' and 'How to Make Stew.' Basically each chapter in this book was an individual cookbook before. I've known, used, and loved CI for years. All of their recipes seem to be flawless to me. They do tons of test cooking and recipe development before allowing anything make it into print. I go to this one and the actual print copies which I also own, all the time for recipes. I've made the Molasses Spice cookies so many times I can't even remember how many of them I've pulled out of ovens.

"It started so well then fizzled out...*** there may be spoilers ***The first chapters were interesting. Even though the premise is so cliche --- secretary falls in love with rich boss --- the book started well. Then we find out from H's POV that he likes the h too. So that's cool. But of course h is portrayed as this super naive 20+ virgin, totally unaware of her own attraction.Anyway, H makes his moves. There is the typical drunken h scene. They get into a relationship. They move in together. They fall in love. H proposes to h. And h turns him down because *** ok, I won't spoil it too much! ***So, sounds almost good, right, even though this premise has been done 500 times we can suspend disbelief. The problem lies in the way it was written. In the last few chapters, there is no emotion to the way the author wrote the scenes. The lack of emotion is so noticeable such that you don't really feel the angst and suffering of h. The big reveal was too clinical. It just ruined the ending for me. There were also some threads to the story that appear to be hanging out there. It almost feels like the author started out so passionately and then just wanted to get it over with near the end.For the price it's sold for, it's overpriced. Wait until it's down to a dollar. Better yet, when it's free.",0
"I gotta tell you that I first heard about this series of books a few years back and was not at all interested and then I fell face first into ""the end of the world as we know it"" when I became a fan of Glenn Beck and took off my blinders and really saw what is happening to this country and to our so called civilized world. As a military veteran I have found this series to be a blast to read. The character development is such that you really get to know them and it hurts you when one of them is hurt or God forbid killed. The author makes it a point to let you know the good guy dosen't always win or live to see tomorrow. Do what I did and get the entire series and read them one right after the other. You won't be dissapointed that is until you run out of books to read. I can't wait until the next one. These books are just what you need for those long lonely nights.",1
I've been a fan of Jon Merz since I read the first Lawson book and I've never been disappointed by anything  Jon has written. This thriller is no exception. Plot twists and turns and the conclusion will not disappoint you.,1
"Werewolf Dylan Gerrano knows his place in the pack, and it is not at the top. After helping his friends Abby and Brynn escape their ruthless alpha, Alan Matthews, they found themselves at the sanctuary of Red Rock. Here they have a new, kinder alpha and a place where they can start to call home. Dylan lived under violent conditions for ten long years, and collected many internal scars. Dylan is not an alpha, but that doesn't mean he isn't deadly. In the previous book, Sanctuary Lost, he killed Alan Matthews, and does not have one bit of regret.New to the sanctuary is Sasha Wallace. Sasha is a witch, who Alan Matthews had, and she escaped after Dylan killed him. Sasha's experience with werewolves has been anything but pleasant, and it is taking her awhile to adjust to the volatile emotions wolves can throw off. On top of that, wolves don't trust witches, and the tension in town is quite high with lots of evil stares her way.When a wolf is found with vampire bites, the town is stumped as to how to help cure her. Dylan and Sasha are fond of research and take to the books to see if they can help come up with a cure. As they spend time together, an attraction starts to build. Sasha worries Dylan's attraction is based solely on his wolf wanting to protect and heal, but after a few steamy kisses, Sasha is convinced it may be the real thing building between them. When their alpha sends them on a road trip to talk to a vampire friend of the pack, Sasha and Dylan spend quality time together and their bond cements.Sanctuary's Price is the third book in Moira Roger's Red Rock Pass series and this time the testosterone is taken down a bit. The first two books present very alpha wolves, but Dylan is quite submissive. But don't let that fool you. One of my favorite things about werewolf paranormal books is the politics and hierarchy of a wolf pack. Dylan is lower because he is submissive, but at Red Rock that doesn't mean he isn't respected. And when it comes to protecting the one he loves, he can fight as well as any alpha. He may not be constantly sneering, and growling if someone looks at his female the wrong way, but he has the ""mine"" concept down quite well.Dylan and Sasha have a very sweet romance going on in this book and it made me smile to read about them. They are both such good natured people, that have had to overcome much in their life to find happiness. You root for these two to finally find each other and experience joy. For as mild mannered they be in public, they have sparks flying in the bedroom.The female I loved in this book more than Sasha is Brynn, who is the heroine from the second book. Brynn was changed into a wolf during the full moon in book two and her wolf is extremely close to the surface at all times. She can almost be considered feral and is such an interesting character to read about. She is totally out of control and I love that she has already had her book, but still has so much yet to go through. She didn't get a ton of page time or overpower the romance between Dylan and Sasha, but she is definitely intriguing.This is the fifth book overall that I have read by Moira Rogers and I have to tell you that I have yet to be disappointed. I love their style of writing - they are sarcastic, funny, the sex is always hot, the action is always violent and their continuation of the stories and world building really stands out. The next book in this series, Sanctuary Unbound is out June first, and features a character we meet briefly in this book - Adam, a flannel wearing lumberjack vampire, who is going to be very fun to read about.",1
"Overall Rating:  3 Rockin' Stars!!!The summary for this book had me set my expectations high.  I thought with a super-hot professional rugby player, Lane Gerrard and an attractive sweet innocent heroine, Kate Alexander there would be many scores! But, I was left unsatisfied in the end.  The story involved a gigantic secret being revealed, and the couple discovering how to deal with the penalties of the match.",0
"M/M/F (2 bisexual males/1 straight female) usually doesn't work well for me for a multitude of reasons, and the love scenes usually make me roll my eyes. They tend to be purple and overdone. Not so in this book! The sex in this book curled my toes. I had to actually catch my breath after the first scene between Cassie and Kyle. Whew. And the heat never lets up! Every encounter in this book is a scorcher.The menage situation in this book is surprisingly believable. Cassie's attraction to both of her best friends and her heartbreak at discovering them together is sweet and realistic. Her reasons for leaving town make perfect sense. Even Kyle and Alan's reason for looking to each other for affection works pretty well. The story isn't perfect, but I found it much more believable than most M/M/F I've encountered.This book was on track to be an A+ read--and then the author pulled out the oldest menage clich&eacute; in the book. No spoilers here, but it's one of those ""love it or hate it"" issues and I'm in the latter camp.If I were to ever read this again, I'd stop after the last big love scene and skip the ending. All in all, a B- read. -9/22/08",1

"I really enjoyed this book. It had a lot of steamy almosts, and a lot of steamy &#34;oh yeahs&#34;, I enjoyed getting to know the characters and some of their background. There were a few things in the side stories that left me wondering about though, as if they were forgotten about due to the main story. I wanted to know what happened between Cassie and Kari, did they talk it out, or just part ways, were there words between the two, it is like the storyline of that part just got dropped.I also wanted to know more about Sarah's story. The other part was talking about the portrait in the antique shop, what happened with the back story to that one, who sold the portrait and why, will we find out all these things later in one of the other books? I know it sounds as if I am complaining, I am not, just left wondering, what if? In other parts of the story I am befuddled, but don't want to go into details because I don't want to give some of the story's secrets away.The story is really well written with lots of details and I definitely plan on reading the rest of the series, because I am hooked on the characters. I just wished there were more werewolf scenes, although I do realize this story was more about Cassie, I guess I wanted a little more action. Overall it is a really good book and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series. The author definitely keeps me wanting more!",1

"This first installment of a werewolf trilogy had the ability to be good, but it wasn't.  The plot had promise, but was not really fleshed out.  Plot was clearly second to sexual dialogue and narration, and narration did not vary between characters.  Author needs to realize that not every character will think or speak the same way about a common subject.  This lack of variation just makes this book full of unnecessary words and makes it seem gratuitous.  Narration and description of characters were repeated - almost as if there was a minimum page requirement.  The characters and plot had promise, but fell totally flat.",0
"This was a great sport romance. Lots of hot, steamy sex. Loved the story line. From the way the characters met, to the hockey scandal. This author did a wonderful job.",1
"There's just way too much action, far too many lying cheating men, and loads of money spent flying to England.  The main character who is supposed to have some smarts falls for one jerk after another.  She works for a threatening idiot, and never gets around to contacting the FBI until late in the narrative - even though she knows they are interested in the boss and getting him locked up would end her troubles.  But that would mean a few 100 pages less of nonsense.  I'm all for people living their dreams of being novelists, but this isn't a good book.",0
"Because I liked the way the story started I hope book one is a teaser.  There seems to be a trend (please make it go away) to publish chapter-like books that require buying the chapters under the guise of buying books in a series.  (Why not just sell them labeled as chapters?)  I digress.I was emotionally hooked with the beginning.  I can understand that this book was not about Steele and plan to read the next book and have all my hopes for the story are realized--sort of like 'the rest of the story'.  Stand alone, this book was entertaining and I would enjoy it in a waiting room but certainly not enough to spend 'I want a good book to read' money.I like that what was told of the story was easy to follow, easy to buy into.  I say that hoping that in the next 'chapters', the story are about Steele, how he came to be the man he has evolved into and what kind of partner criteria he has that meant he was wide open and available when she came along?  There was nothing about Steele in this book.  He was a boy, then he is a man, a force to be reckoned with in her living room.  I want to see them become not just lovers but a well oiled team as well.There is more, right?",0
"This book showed promise and as I continued waiting for it to deliver, I realized that it wasn't going to.  An editor is needed. Too many errors. 'Your' becomes 'you're' etc. There are too many characters and no way of remembering who is who.  The gratuitous sex scene (if there were more than one I'll never know since I've stopped reading the book)is unnecessary and so cliched, it left me wondering about the main character's integrity. All in all: buy something else!",0
"The elders of a clan of were-cats based in a country town of Middlemarch are concerned with recent behavior of several young male members of their community. They arrange a dance and invite people from neighboring cities to attend hoping the restless males will find mates and perhaps settle down.When Emily hears about the dance she decides it's just the thing she needs.  6 months prior, her cheating husband left her for another woman and was killed the same day.  Talk about Karma.  Tired of the living the lie that her husband was a good man and she had a perfect life, she is ready to let loose and experience a night of passion, no strings attached.Saber Mitchell is determined to find mates for his 4 rowdy younger brothers.  After years of dating and searching for his mate, he's come to the conclusion that it's not meant to be for him, but that doesn't stop him from insisting he and his brothers attend that dance in search of mates for them.When Sabre meets Emily the physical attraction is immediate and mutual. The two of them share a night of passion, first outside the dance in the dark and later at Saber's home.  This is uncharacteristic behavior for Emily but she goes with it finding herself drawn to Saber but with a few reservations. Saber recognizes Emily as his mate and must figure out how to win her love, gain her trust and reveal his were-cat nature.Scarlet Woman is a very sexy read.  I felt that Emily and Saber lacked a little heat in the very beginning though.  I didn't pick up the chemistry or immediate attraction they felt that lead to the intimacy they shared early on. However as their relationship developed they certainly warmed things up both physically and emotionally drawing me in and  they had me rooting for their happily ever after.This book focused mostly on the development of the relationship between Saber and Emily.  I really thought at some point there would be a dangerous conflict or something besides Emily's reluctance to commit to a relationship that would cause dissension but it never came about. There was a reporter nosing around the town investigating sightings of black panthers which became an annoyance for the couple, but there never really was a conflict from that angle which was surprising to me.Saber's brothers were very mischievous with a side of super sexy.  They provided some nice comic relief among the romance and I look forward to reading their stories as well.  The twins, in particular, got my attention with their fun loving attitude.Overall, I enjoyed this paranormal romance and look forward to reading more of the Middlemarch March series.",0
Good novel easy reading and a delight to read. Helped me to relax and dream easily.Would recommend to those who like Bianca's work.,1
"I've read a lot of books on manifestation and this one is definitely the best.The author offers up techniques and exercises that actually worked for me, andthat's all that really matters, right?I used the exercises in this book and INSTANTLY saw results. I felt more powerful,more in control, and had the energy and motivation to start making my dreams areality.This book gave me the big push I needed to actually get what I wanted in life.It WORKS!It's different from all the other books on the subject because it shows you HOWto take action, what steps to take, and how to get results. It's not just anecdotesand fluff -- it takes you through the process and practically forces you to get results.If you only get one book on manifestation, make it this one.",1
"As humans began to travel to the outer planets of the solar system, alien space ships are found outside the orbit of Mars that destroy any Earth-built ship attempting to pass, prohibiting the exploration and possible expansion of humanity beyond the inner planets. Flash forward 70 years after the discovery of the alien ship ""screen"" to an Earth limited not only to travel within the inner solar system but one ruled by the corrupt military organization called TERRA.Now toss in one hot-headed, selfish TERRA cadet who has alienated himself from just about everyone in the TERRA military ranks, an advanced star ship that was secretively built by rebellious members of TERRA and having the capability to breach the alien screen and you have the basic plot of Phoenix Exodus. Despite this interesting set-up, the author delivers an annoying and unbelievable story. Let me clarify my objections: (a) neither of the two lead characters are likeable; (b) the before-mentioned hot-headed cadet main character hasn't served any time aboard space craft but is given command of the Phoenix one day before it sets out on the historic voyage; (c) stretching my credibility even further is the cadet is an unmotivated genius who distrusts anyone in authority and this is offered up as reason he is given command; (d) the main character abruptly switches between self-adulation-boorish-nuts-to-you-all attitude to an awkward depressed-I'm-no-good-to-anyone like a flash-bulb going off; and, finally, (e) the alien space ship screen is surprisingly easy to breach.This would be a one star review but for one reason - the book is cheap so one can't complain too loudly for what you get.",0
The book started out slow but it did pick up pace. The plot summary had potential but faltered in many aspects. The writting of the charaters in some instances were just not believable. Also the ending was just ridiculous. The ending tried to wrap everything up in a pretty little bow that just didn't make sense.,0

"In ""Tabloid Star"", which is a very good tale, by the way, we got to witness the romance of Josh and Ryan. Ryan an up-and-coming mega action film star, and Josh a beefy burly bartender at a hot local club. By the end, the two men committed to each other as a couple. In this tale, the story picks up with their wedding.The story is not as compelling as Tabloid Star, but that's not really a problem. You see, the drama was laid out in Tabloid Star, and it's there that the traditional romance unveils. This shorter tale is for fans of the original story who want to see what life has in store for our two heroes. There love is not in question, so there's no conflict there. If anything, this story serves as a sort of extended epilogue. It toggles back and forth between the wedding itself and the events leading up to it after Tabloid Star.It's short, it's sweet, and it's priced accordingly. It lacks the conflict and drama of a romance story because, well, it's not. But it still easily fulfills its original intent of closing out the original tale and letting fans of those two characters have a taste of them again. Tabloid Star was the cake, and With This Ring is the scoop of ice cream on the side.",1

"The premise of this book was intriguing and sounded fun so I was really looking forward to reading it.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.  Okay--it really was fun, in a strange sort of way, but the sophomoric writing style coupled with an inexcusable number of errors and omissions stole the fun and, therefore, the enjoyment. I certainly hope this fairly prolific author has learned to put out a better product with his later works because this first one is a disaster.  It's not so bad that I would recommend you NOT read it, but be prepared for frustration if you do. Suggestion: If you are offering a free book in the hopes that it will incite people to purchase other works of yours, you might consider offering your best product, not your worst.",0

"Starting out as a thriller this book slows down as it goes by seems to lose it's original voice.  By the 60% mark I was convinced there could not be a satisfying ending and that stayed with me right up until the unsatisfying ending.It really disappointed me because the book started out so strong.  The premise seems incredibly solid.  What would happen if the Virgin Mary's body was discovered.  Carrie,  Father Fitzpatrick,  Kesev, Emilio...  These are incredibly well written characters and the author begins this story building our interest in each if them with just enough information about them and their motivations to want to know more about them.  But again just past the half way point things begin to come apart.  Our once interesting characters seems to go one dimensional.  Carrie is no longer a complex woman she is more or less capable of focusing only on the Virgin.  Emilio turns into the standard hit man caricature and Fitzpatrick is now like a schoolboy when his girlfriend stops paying attention to him.By the end of the book we have the main characters meeting up with the underdeveloped ""bad guy,  right wing politician"",  the Virgin and apparently the hurricane manifestation of god.  Oh and god hates religion,  you know even the one his disciples founded and he is an enviromentalist too!The Afterward clears up some of the questions as to why the story began and probably why it unraveled but that of course does not make the book a good read.",0
"First off, this product was only available in American Standard which isn't a translation I use often, but chose since it was the only one formatted for eReader. It is still difficult to jump around to various scriptures quickly, which I do during a study group or sermon. The concept still needs polishing, but the concept is good.",0
I gave this book a bottom rating as a warning that although published in 2010 this book has no ending. It is supposed to be book one but you are left hanging at the end. Either the author has died has no inspiration or doesnt care about his audience but you are left bereft for no reason.,0

"When I read a mystery, I look for some semblance of realism and a certain degree of credibility. I did not find either in great abundance in David Kessler's Mercy. It's not that it's poorly written. On the contrary Kessler can write and write well. His tale is just hard to swallow and gets progressively less digestible the more you consume of it. The story finally degenerates into the realm of the absurd.A fiction author has a responsibility to do his or her homework, and Kessler frequently fails in this respect. He obviously doesn't know much about firearms and demonstrates this ignorance in his confusion between an automatic pistol and a revolver (the former ejects shell casings while the latter retains them in each of the six chambers). He also knows little of hand-to-hand fighting, having a lightweight woman being able to head-butt and punch-out a burly prison guard. I was ready to puke after the second time he used the description ""Punch to the stomach followed by a viscous uppercut"".  No mas! I've had quite enough of the implausible.",0

The original illustrations here are interesting but I found the later illustrations in the other compilation even more interesting.",1
"Yes this book had a lot to take in - but to me it was wonderful - you can't please everyone, but you need  a superb start to a series to capture attention. Ms Bell did just that. i did not want put this book down - to the point that i got it at 3pm finished at 10pm (had to get a few errands done, so i grudgingly put it down for a bit) to buy the second one - and write this reviewWho does not like Fae books with Leprechauns?

"This wasn't one of my favorite Maya Banks.  I was just not that into it.  The emotion was raw and really well written, but there was just too much of it.  It spilled over the pages of the books and left me feeling depressed by the end.  I didn't really understand the villains motivation he was just doing things to do them. And while the characters were well fleshed out I found myself not really liking them.  There was not enough lightness in the dialogue between them to actually get into the romance.  I kept hoping they would hook up just so the book would end. It just wasn't an enjoyable read.  Which is disappointing because I almost always love books by Maya Banks.  I would give this one a pass though.",0

"I know we don't necessarily pick these books up for the plots, but the plot in this book was such a major distraction that it was hard for me to finish.  The first half of the book works pretty well, but the &#34;conspiracy&#34; part only works if you're willing to accept that virtually everybody was cousins or college roomies at some point -- and it just defied belief.  You also have to accept that two different professional football teams would have really astonishingly lax security at their stadiums, as well as other things like believing that a quarterback, even a backup, would have all these days off during the football season.The sex scenes, honestly, why we're probably picking the book up in the first place were relatively solid, although there were some points where I wish the author had thought a bit more carefully about her word choices (I don't like the mental image brought up by reading about female body parts &#34;unfurling,&#34; for example).  The heat between the characters was conveyed well, but Anna was such a neurotic basket case I found myself wondering why he was even interested in her.",0
"Santos joins in for a m&eacute;nage. Meanwhile, Jean Jacques succeeds in making Lily jealous after she denies again the desire between them. Jane basically remains in her Antonio's bedroom all day.

"Dakota Men, yes they are !! I enjoyed this story and the interesting characters.  She hops in bed a little fast, but the story warrants it.  The scenes are erotic, loving, and wonderful.  I had a hard time putting it down.  I enjoy Maya's books, and will be reading more of her work.  Enjoy!!",1
"I can't remember how I stumbled upon this book but I'm so glad I did! It was an interesting read and provided hours of entertainment via hanging on the edge of my seat! This book has a lot of action but it also has a great &#34;book worm&#34; factor with all of Abby's research. I really like how the author incorporated alot of truthful tidbits into the story, several of which I hadn't run across in the general knowlege base of Kennedy conspiracies. It wasn't a rehash and even though some of the action was a bit unbelivable and I had a hard time accepting some of the later characters like Rob and Demetrius, overall it was a very solid book with good strong lead characters. I think a few more sprinklings of &#34;the times&#34; would have made it more authentic- several of the later scenes in the college town felt too modern for me, seeing as how the story took place in the early 80s, but maybe that's just me! Pick it up- it's totally worth the $3!!",1
Yikes!  I truly enjoyed this read even with all the grammatical errors.  Fast paced and original.  Keep it coming! I will look forward to the next one.,1

"Okay, I bought In Memory of Greed for my Nook several months back after seeing it become the #1 Top-Rated Political Thriller here on Amazon. It's gotta be good, right?Turns out that was a serious mistake.Boudreau has a fascinating premise in this book--a corporation trying to control the world's seed stocks, an ex-SEAL caught up in the confusion trying to stop it. Unfortunately, the premise is quickly derailed by unlikable, one-note characters and shoddy plotting. Judging by Amazon, this was Boudreau's first effort, and it shows. By the time the book is over, you've completely forgotten about the seed stocks and moved on to a pretty much unconnected plot. If this, and the heavy-handed writing style(never have I seen so many adverbs!) don't ruin the book, the characters will.Mocado, the SEAL and ""hero"" of the story, is a highly-trained superman who never does anything wrong--except when he does something very stupid. This happens with enough frequency that you start wondering why natural selection hasn't weeded this guy out long before the story opens.Roth, the CEO, is a gluttonous, hard-drinking windbag whose chief skill lies in nearly killing himself in his fits of rage. Once again, natural selection.Jenn(no last name), the love interest, whose character really never elicits the kind of sympathy that would make you care whether she lives or dies. There's just not enough depth to her characterization.Keegan, Roth's enforcer, an Irishman whose behavior throughout the novel completely betrays the ""twist"" Boudreau tries to give him at the end.Graves, the politician. Pretty much a carbon copy of Roth, I spent most of the book trying to tell them apart--although Graves is not prone to the fits of rage of the CEO.And Barstow, the female secret agent. She's a good counterpart to Mocado, in that she's a highly trained operative prone to frequent moments of stupidity. She would have made a better love interest than the completely anemic and colorless Jenn, but not by much.I put down the book eight times before finally deciding to finish. Rather than having characters I could sympathize with--half-way through I was hoping for a nuke to eliminate them all and start afresh. To put it bluntly, it was a painful experience, and I'll never trust Amazon's Top-Rated list again. Mr. Boudreau is in serious need of writing classes, and a better editor. His reviewers, on the other hand, are in need of remedial studies in what makes a good political thriller. Try Clancy, Thor, or Baldacci.",0

"A modern rendition of Charle's Dickens'A Christmas Carol (Dover Thrift Editions).This book was a warm, easy, fun read, perfect for getting into the Christmas spirit. It is light hearted and humorous but the Dickens's message comes through strong.  This is not a literary masterpiece like the Dickens's novel but it will motivate you to make hot cocoa and sit by the fire while reading it.",1

three men sounds awesome!!! til you find out ones bi-sexual and has a crush on one of the other men and is gonna get a chance at the other guy whether the other guy really wants it or not.....deep sigh...yet another e-book I deeply regret buying...if you like guy on guy action..even when one of the guys isn't particularly interested then this is the book for you..i couldn't bare to finish it...for me in a menage with 1 woman and multiple men i like all the romantic and sexual attention focused on said woman...I read these as a fantasy and it's not my fantasy to even share a man period! but especially with another man...but what pisses me off the most if that man on man action isn't spelled out in the desc...you have to either scan reviews or waste 3/4 dollars on the book to find out..all i ask is to be warned to i can make an informed decision and not waste my money...wish i could get it back on kindle books..,0
"Pros - I really love the interaction among Cullen's family, and I adore mom. What a feisty bird she is!Cons - In Plain Sight was really just related toRachel's Totem. It happens to be set in the same town with characters being connected in only the smallest sense. They don't really tie in well together until you get to the next book in the series,Foxy Lady, when we see Cullen working alongside the catamount clan.",1

This Bible is not easy to find your verses. You can go to Table of Contents to pick the book of the Bible but then it takes you to Chapter 1 of that book. If I need Psalm chapter 150 I have to scroll through 149 chapters to get to it. You can touch the link at Psalm 1:1 but all that does is bring up every chapter and verse (sans the actual text) and you still have to scroll through all of it to get to Psalm 150:1. This is useless. Waste of money. I still gave it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because it is the Bible which is the greatest book ever written.,0
"Bodie finds out he has a son, sixteen years later. WE on the other hand do not know who the Mother was, the relationship between all these individuals until half the book is over. It was frustrating. The book is dated quite a bit by being a contemporary book but released in 1995.",0
"I really enjoyed the book, but can see where it does need some character development.  Would also like to see the Elven Prince get his own girl rather than someone else's though. I am not giving anything away by saying this because it is an aside of the premise of the book.  Maybe it could be a third book in a trilogy just because I liked said prince even though he was doing a pretty good impression of a spoiled brat. He has some potential of being a hero all on his own.",1

"This is a short fantastical story about writing (specifically the need to write) and what makes life &#34;real.&#34;  I enjoyed it, but something about the timeline felt &#34;off&#34; to me -- the way the author compressed this specific life into a short story felt rushed, especially with the too-frequent &#34;chapter&#34; breaks.",0

"Well, maybe not even that long, since when the Kindle hit around 84% it ended, and the rest was a preview of the next book.  That's OK, though--since I'd had enough sex scenes by then.  Don't get me wrong, the sex scenes were the good parts.  Although the writing style was pretty good, the story was just shallow, sorry to say.(Spoiler)Not so good parts:No real plot.  Of all the reasons why a Dark Angel is called to dole out vengeance, enabling a woman to get even with a cheating ex-boyfriend doesn't seem quite important enough.  But maybe that's just me.No real character development.  She's supposed to be a powerful Witch in her own right, so why should she need an Angel to help her get even with her Ex?  He's an Angel who is bored sitting around the Underworld waiting for the Devil to give him an assignment.  So, of course, he's thrilled when a sad Witch needs his help.  And what does he do to to give her the revenge that she craves?  He beats the guy up.  Yep, I'm not kidding.No real world building.  Witches, Angels, Devil.....but no background on any hows or whys of the rules in regard to humanity.  If it's that easy to get your hands on a sexy winged hunk,  there should have been a lot of happy women in that world.So the Witch and the Dark Angel end up falling in love and having lots of sex.  The Witch gives the Angel a more permanent assignment by wishing that he stay with her forever.  Done.  End of story.  Now you don't have to read it.  You're welcome.",0
"I got this book for free and was excited because I had read, a long time ago, one of this authors's books and vaguely remembered enjoying it.  Well, that didn't happen with this book.  There really isn't much of a story, it is a couple of hours out of a couple's life, just after being wed.  I couldn't get invested in what they were experiencing and there wasn't much romance...or sex....just dialogue and thoughts.  Anyway, it felt like I was reading an epilogue and I missed the entire book.  I finished it and didn't hate it so two stars but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I am not tempted to buy any other books by this author based on this book.",0

"The beginning of this book reminded me of the movie Kiss of the Dragon (with Jet Li and Bridget Fonda).  Though it started out as a familiar story, I have to say that it drew me in.  I liked Two right off the bat and hated Darren immediately.  This is big for me.  I have to have a develop ""relationship"" with the characters right away and Buecheler did that well in this book.After the first two chapters or so, I was just waiting for something to happen.  There was a lot of character and relationship development in the first half of the book (which is great) but not much else going on.  Once Theroen entered the picture the action seemed to stop.  Sure, there was Two's transition into a vampire and the feeding that comes along with it, but I feel like there could have been more action to draw the reader further into the story.  With character and relationship development and nothing else, it was hard to see what the whole plot of the story was aside from ""handsome vampire rescues girl"".The second half (well, really about 2/3 into it) finally got into the ""guts"" of the story, the plot development, the action and (let's face it) the whole point of the book.  With so much leading up to it, I was ready for some serious conflict, a really great fight scene or something along those lines.  I feel like that never happened.  Don't get me wrong, there were some great parts and some good ideas but I feel like the story fell flat.  There was so much potential for it to be really great but it never quite made it.  The best part was when Two returned to seek revenge (I'm not going to call that a spoiler because as soon as you start the book you know that's coming at some point in the book), but even that could have been better.  I just feel like it left something to be desired.Favorite quote:""Sex is sex.  Love is love.  The first is a raw biological process, the latter is something more.""It wasn't a bad book by any means.  It was a dark, gritty and dramatic story.  Once I finished, my first thought was that it was 4 star worthy.  But then I started writing my review and as I was rehashing the book in my head I started realizing that I wished there was more to the story.  There were some really great ideas (the progression into vampirism, the evil elder, the different effects that vampirism has on different people, etc.) but I just think they were poorly executed.  It had the potential to be a 5 star book with a little more action and if there was a little more effort and detail put into the key scenes.  I felt like by the time the story was fully developed the author rushed to finish the book.This is the first book in a trilogy.  I did like it and I will be downloading the next book, Blood Hunt, when it's released.",0

"Serial (which is currently only available for the Kindle) is a novella co-written by horror writers Jack Kilborn (a.k.a. J.A. Konrath) and Blake Crouch. The story grabs your attention immediately with a great first line: ""The hardest thing about killing a hitchhiker is finding one to pick up."" As that sentence and the book's title should suggest, the subject matter of the book is disturbing. It's definitely not for the faint of heart.The story is told in three parts. The first section, written by Kilborn, is about Donaldson, a serial killer who likes to pick up hitch hikers and do bad things to them. His latest conquest and Donaldson's subsequent disposal of his passenger's remains are described in lurid detail. In the second part of the book Blake Crouch tells the story of another serial killer, Lucy, who is arguably even sicker than Donaldson. I won't ruin the surprise by describing her modus operandi. The third part of the book was co-written by the two authors, who took turns contributing 100-odd-word snippets until the story was finished. But they did so blindly, without the benefit of having read one another's initial sections. (The authors describe the writing process in an interview section following the story.) The last segment reads like a macabre chess match as the two killers meet and, unaware of the other's nature and intentions, try to outmaneuver each other. The story hangs together very well, particularly given its mode of composition. And it ends fittingly, if not surprisingly. The story doesn't offer anything by way of character development, but it's a quick read and it certainly holds one's attention for the short time it takes to read it.-- Debra Hamel",0
"If you like BDSM, this is for you.  But for me, it didn't really deliver on romance at all.  The hero was too consumed with his own needs fhroughout most of the book.  The heroine was weak.  Neither character was well developed. He was not really alpha.  He didn't even really protect her from her parents or her enemies.  WEAK story.  WEAK character development.  But, lots of BDSM.  The author is definitely relying on this to sell her book.  Not enough story for me.  Especially since I just read a couple of truly five star stories by Pamela Clare.",0

"First, I will say I downloaded all three novellas in the Moon Trilogy and have read them all. The summaries seemed interesting and the free price...well you can't beat that.However, I was not impressed with the novellas. They were just OK. The idea behind each of the stories is great and have excellent potential. The execution of the idea is where the problem begins.This trilogy is marketed as novellas and rightfully so. They are very short, couple hours read at most. However, just because they are novellas does not mean the story has to be shorted.I felt that Black Moon, especially, was shorted. There is very little if any character development. There is no build up to the intimate scene between the two main characters. Basically, they meet, are immediately attracted to one another and then have sex. There is very little background to add to the characters. They are a bit bland, and left me wondering who they really were. The secondary characters are also very bland with very little said about them than they're the bad guys. I think there should have been more background there as these secondary characters (the wolf pack) come back further into to trilogy to play a more prominent and vital role in the overall story.The plot felt too rushed. The sex scene took up to much of the overall story. I felt much of that could have been used to further the storyline and build a better plot. It starts out good and on the right path then the middle just stalls out on the sex scene and the ending feels rushed. It's like the final showdown or the finale is there and then just as quickly over. The build up to it is bland as well.As the first of the trilogy, this book should have had more insight into the overall plot of the trilogy, the importance of the book as well as the other two pieces, which our the primary premise behind the next two books. It should stand alone, but at the same time intrigue the reader to want to read more. This one did not, and book two almost seems more of a first book into the trilogy with Black Moon not really fitting in. It's was kind of like Black Moon was written and then the author got the idea for the rest of the trilogy but didn't go back to smooth out Black Moon to fit in and lead into the rest. I would say book two and three were better with more defined and developed characters and better plot execution.There are also many editing issues. A simple proofread before publishing would have corrected much of this. The editing does seem to get better as the trilogy moves on, however. The editing issues are a bit distracting at times, but I have seen much worse.On the upside, the storyline and the world created are excellent, unique in their own right, and intriguing. And, this could very well be my main problem with these novellas. I was very interested in the overall storyline and the world created, but left feeling shorted. Like there was so much more that could have been done with this story. Honestly, I think the overall storyline would have been better served as three full books with better development and more defined detail. I just felt there was too much missing and left untold like this was the cliff notes version.I have read other works by this author, and find some of them to be much better. Actually, I've just purchased another of this author's works. I don't think this was the author's best work, but I feel it could very well have been if it had been better planned and prepared.Overall, it's not a bad read...just not a great read, but for the price it's not a waste.",0

"Definitely one for believers and ONLY believers.Basically a religious tract masquerading as a short story, with the usual quota of painfully inept and sophomoric ""philosophical arguments"" aimed wholly and solely at confirming the pre-existing beliefs of Christians.  The ""learned discussion"" between the protagonist and her ""mentor"" is unintentionally hilarious in its ineptitude.  Neither of those ""academics"" would have made it past their first semester in college - it is that bad.This is best described as ""faith-enabling"".  If you know why that is a bad thing, avoid this rubbish like the plague.  I couldn't get past the first few pages.Seriously, why do people who don't understand the basics of logic or philosophy try to write academic characters?

"Although this isn't the usual kind of read I expect when I think of Kallysten it's definitely got her touch.  I'm used to more erotic vs. sensual romance although this story lacks in the erotic it doesn't lack for emotion or conflict.Kate is an extremely strong female, Marc is a Vampire and Blake is his Childe.  The three make for amazing chemistry and witty banter.  From first meeting there is a spark and although Kate is put off by Blake's cocky attitude she's extremely intrigued by Marc and his relationship with Blake.  Kate has lived as a soldier for quite some time, she's bonded as a warrior with her fellow teammates, Marc and Blake bring the woman back out in her.

The story was also choppy and unbelieveable...this kind of stuff just doesn't happen to real people and it was hard to like the story. I did adore Dakota, even though he wasn't very real either. I had a hard time getting through all the love babble between Dakota and Mac...I just don't think people talk that way and that much about their feelings for one another....and then feel like it has to constantly be repeated. It was a good read, though.",1
"The story jumped from the past to the present every other chapter. At one point I guessed at what had happened in the past to effect the present but as a reader I'm like just say it and move on. I'm not a fan brutality and that 1 scene just changed the whole story for me.It's so much cruelty in the world that reading romance stories is my escape to what love between consenting adults should be.In short I found the story choppy, sad, and with a drawn out sub theme.",0
"Rina walks into a random room and the door closes behind her and there is this guy who is sitting in the shadows, (Possibly tenting his fingers and looking like some sort of lunatic)but Rina only want's to get out of her shoes. Apparently, they hurt so bad, she doesn't give a darn that this man had been sitting there (Tented fingers) for what felt like a half hour of dialog about how big of a power player she is.Can he even manage to get up? For a few pages I thought he may have lost use of his legs, and that he would roll out of the shadows in a wheelchair.Thinking ""Sucks for you, Rina. Looks like you're doing all the work.""And OMG! This guy really needs to shut up!Seriously, he was like, ""Don't speak, Slave. I have something to say."" still hasn't gotten up out of the chair. ""I'm gonna tie you up and then tell you to undress yourself. Because it would be funny to watch you look stupid.""Yeah, This story didn't play out well in my mind. But don't let me deter you from reading it.... It's free after all.",0
"If you have read the first two books in the series, this makes a lot of sense, otherwise go back and read those first. Very enjoyable except for perhaps too much dialogue here and there, which sometimes becomes boring, especially where Enin is involved.",1
"This book contains 3 short stories and an intro to get to know the two main characters, Wistril and his assistant Kern.  Wistril seems to be a pretty powerful wizard who has taken an very strict oath on non violence.  No matter the situation he cannot use magic to harm others.  This leads him to have some very creative solutions to problems that most wizards would solve with a simple fireball or lightning bolt.The interaction between Wistril and his assistant is always a source of amusement with Kern having no idea what Wistril is actually up to most of the time.  I will agree with another reviewer and say that I would have liked to get to know the characters a bit better to enjoy the stories more.This is the first book I have read by Mr. Tuttle and I can say that for sure I will be looking into more.",1
"65 Proof is a collection of short stories written by J.A. Konrath, aka Jack Kilborn. These stories run the gambit from good to mediocre and to some that just make you wonder about the psyche of Mr. Konrath. They are all fun to read. It was enjoyable to read the short stories featuring Jack, Phinneas and Harry. If you want to read something while waiting for a doctor's appointment or in between tv shows then this book has everything that  you could want to read; some are funny, some are intriguing, others will make you scratch your head.All I can say is it was a fun read, not great literature but definitely not boring. Enjoy",1
The premis of this book is great never read anything like it!  Not you normal regency romance. This is a must read!!!!!!!,1
Stay with me was worth its price. But you must like menege stories. The guys Rhys and Logan are clueless as to what is expected in a committed relationship and keep putting Catherine as the bottom of their to-do list which makes her rethink the relationship. I've read the book twice and its a keeper,1
Now that I have read all the works of Jules Verne...this one wasn't too bad and kept my interest. Even though movies have been made from Verne's publications from long ago...the movies in my opinion don't do justice to the books. For my liking I still think Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is his best.,1
"The characters were boring.  The story went nowhere.  I got to 20% and tried to keep going, waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen.  I couldn't focus at all because I just wasn't interested.  I gave up and deleted this.",0
"This book is written for young, immature audience. Although it's comical it racist slurs wasn't suitable for my liking. It is definitely a fiction because as a teacher I can honestly say such bizarre activity doesn't exist in a classroom setting.",0
"This installment in the Tales of the Were series was better than the first book.  Now this is the way a series should progress.  Subsequent installments should be at least as good as, if not better, than their predecessors.  Inferno set me ablaze with it's action, suspense, twists, turns, orginality, scintillating sex scenes and Dante!  The action is reviting and the story progresses at a good pace.  This books stand alone but I highly recommend that you read the first book in the series: The Were Lords""  Which focuses on my second favorite sub Werewolves and those 2 Alpha twins will cause more than just your heart to flutter.  lolAh! Dante!! ""Dominantly Masculine; ""Undeniably Sexy""  ""A Force to be reckoned With;""  ""Dips and Valleys of Masculine Perfection."" Dante gets my (not so Famous) 5 SWOON SALUTE!  As sexy as the cover is I don't think it does Dante justice.  I like Megan's character, in fact, she is the perfect heroine and Duncan was beyond delicious. There are none of the angsts, misunderstanding or stupid choices that so many romance novels are filled with.This is a must read for adults who love the paranormal, suspense, action and romance.  There is a good plot and the story is filled with twist and turns that are quite unique.  HOWEVER, be forewarned this novel is not for adults who shy away from Hot, Steamy, Scintillating sex scenes.  Personally I wouldn't change a thing!  So what are you waiting for buy it already! :-)**SPOILER ALERT*** This book ended on such a malevolent note that my spine rippled with chills of anticipation for the next installment!",1
"Birth of the Peacekeepers actually surprised me a lot.  Disaster/post-disaster scenarios are not uncommon and have become something of a clich&eacute; so I wasn't sure I would like it.  I was very, very pleasantly surprised because the author has created such a believable scenario that I very quickly got lost in the action.  I was captivated from the very first page.  The pages literally turn themselves and I personally have stayed up way too late more than once as I couldn't wait to see what happened next.Unlike a lot of other post-apocalyptic world's I've read about the author here has created a group of characters that are not perfect, not special - rather they are ordinary people reacting in an extraordinary environment.  Ricky Sides has a wonderful, very readable style.  A truly fantastic read that I would highly recommend to anyone.  I can't wait to finish the series",1
"I give this a solid three stars, because while it certainly has serious language issues, I enjoyed the storytelling.What I mean by language issues is that Scott Marlowe, like all too many writers, has a smaller vocabulary than he thinks he does, and tends to use words incorrectly because he doesn't actually know their meaning and they sound like the word he does mean. He doesn't always spell words correctly, either (he consistently writes ""scraping"" as ""scrapping""), and there were examples of ""it's"" for ""its"" and ""who's"" for ""whose"". His sentences sometimes have missing words, change number partway through, are grammatically incomplete or (often) have misrelated participles.All these are issues that a good editor would fix. What's harder to get right is an enjoyable and engaging story, and while Marlowe hardly breaks new ground with this generic secondary-world fantasy, he does tell his story well and avoids the worst cliche of the genre: a Chosen One on a quest to save the world.The issues the characters bring with them made them a little more rounded, and while the plot is occasionally driven by someone doing something stupid, it's always understandably stupid and not (as is so often the case with books like this) unbelievably stupid.With a good editor, and preferably a little more originality in the worldbuilding, this could be a writer to watch.",0
"This fabulously written book drew me in.  Miranda's a little like the wife in the movie True Lies, she lives simply to take care of her husband the lightkeeper, and her two boys.  But she loves deeply, and she takes action when her husband disappears. She is naive and finds herself in a foreign world with the only resource of herself to rely upon.  She stumbles around not knowing what a morass she has placed herself into. Nothing is at it seems. She can't tell the good guys from the bad guys. This character development and plot is a study of subtlety. There is enough suspense and mystery to intrigue the reader to stick with Miranda. I love Miranda. I love devoted mothers and wives.  I really love that this author made the power of love be the guiding motivation for our heroine.  This is not an action genre book.  Which makes it all the more delicious.  This is a real life fantasy, sci-fi, magic story that you can't quite pin anywhere.  The writing is superb.  The reviewers who didn't like this book are probably needing 'in your face' stimulation that is fast and dramatic. This is a book to be savored and tasted. It's like engaging in high tea with Devon cream and croissants. You soak in the ambiance, smell the salt air, skirt the garbage and stay alert to being followed.  This is the most courageous of heroines because she diligently continues her search with her inadequate knowledge. She pieces together the mystery of her husband. She continues on in the face of complete unknowing - which is one of the greatest challenges we each face in our own world. She continues on even when everything she knows turns upside down. This book is a bestseller for a reason.  It is an amazing book.  I can not recommend it highly enough.",1
"I was immediately drawn by the book's cover. It reminds me of those lurid (meant in a good way!) covers on old horror stories which I love and miss with today's generic appearance of most books. The plot summary sealed the deal: I had to read this one!Three different story-lines are intricately woven into a compelling story: a clan of vampire-like beings called longclaws living in a parallel, prehistoric-like world, hunting for fresh blood and hiding from other, even more menacing creatures. An ancient Indian tribe knowing about the dangerous otherworldly beasts and closing the energy lines leading to their world. A teenage runaway boy ending up with his old great-uncle who lives to protect humanity by guarding the portal.Then one longclaw discovers a way to cross the border into paradise: our human world, where they are superior predators among easy prey. A brutal fight for survival begins - on both sides.The author uses different time lines, parallel worlds and different points of view, sometimes retelling a scene as experienced from both humans and longclaws. Where other books get lost in their overwhelming, confusing complexity, that is never the case with longclaws, where all parts converge into a coherent and unique whole.The underlying premise that our folklore especially about vampires and werewolves stems from encounters with creatures from another dimension mark Longclaws as an outstanding work in the 'fangs&claws;' genre. However, this distinctive novel will surely appeal to fans of all types of horror.(I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review)",1
"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 6/10PROS:- The tentative back-and-forth nature of the men's relationship when they first start seeing each other is tender and a nice change from the all-or-nothing seduction often portrayed in m/m romances.- Harley struggles mightily with his desire for Ryan, and I loved that Harley makes himself suffer for so long before doing anything about it. I like reading about characters who have some sexual restraint.- Once the guys start a physical relationship, there are several bedroom scenes, and most of them are of the angry variety. Blackwell captures the tone of such episodes very well. One minute the men are snarling and shoving each other, and the next they're snarling and kissing.CONS:- The two guys are constantly saying hurtful and/or offensive things to each other. In several instances, in fact, I found one guy or the other simply despicable.- Ryan's constant wavering about his feelings for Harley is enough to induce whiplash (and I do mean CONSTANT, as in he hates and desires and pities and admires Harley one after another, all within the span of a single scene).- The transition from ""Ryan hates Harley and is cruel to him"" to ""Ryan loves Harley and wants to live with him"" is incredibly abrupt. In fact, there's not much of a transition at all. He just changes, literally overnight.- The descriptions throughout the story are a little flowery and over-the-top for me. Here's an example: ""His face was exquisite, like an angel in human form. His lips were full and pink, his nose small and button-like. A pair of startling, amber-colored eyes fringed with lush lashes..."" And so on.Overall comments: There's a good story here, and it's actually one of the more convincing Gay for You stories I've read, but I didn't find it very enjoyable overall. The angst level is high, what with Harley's unrequited feelings, Ryan's sexual confusion, and both men's near-constant anger at each other. Each time I thought they'd moved past the hostile/cruel stage, they ended up saying or doing something hurtful again in the next scene.",0
"So sorry but this is so blah, like white rice and watered gravy. The seemed to be trying to create a sense of mystery so we would be surprised by the child 's lack of power and personality so that we would be happy when she did something.Yet not much was exciting...just a jealous and vengeful child emerged. Could have been better I felt no love or pity for the girl. The society from which she evolved was not believable...again blah and not much sci -ti or fantasy feelings to it.",0
"I am thankful that this book was free because I just downloaded it to read.  One page only and it says ""this title is out of print"".  If it is out of print, then remove it from Amazon - don't leave it on for people to download, then have to delete it, or worse yet ... purchase it and waste their time (and Amazon's time) to get a refund.",0
"I appreciated this book as a memoir of the author's life: an interesting Native american man.  I enjoyed all of the content until the last chapter, which was (suddenly) a dirge for all that was lost after the wave of European immigration.  I would have loved a chapter before that, to transition from the (relatively) good times to the clearly bad times.The writing is light and clear.  The legends are well recounted, and the anecdotes are well-told.",1
"Book Title: The Classmate MurdersAuthor: Bob MoatsPublisher: Magic1 ProductionASIN: B002D48NBOReviewed by Michele Tater for The Coach Tater ReviewMiddle age is when your old classmates are so gray and wrinkled and bald they don't recognize you. ~Bennett CerfJim Richards a sixty year old who lives with his parents and recently has lost his job as a security guard for a car dealership. He is an avid reader of reading and watching anything related to mystery; books, movies and television series. The book ""The Classmate Murders"" follows this older in body than mind, gentleman who leads a simple and somewhat boring life until he receives a disturbing e-mail from a high school classmate. She was actually an ex-girlfriend of his who was now afraid that someone wanted to take her life. Unfortunately, he receives that message too late and she is found dead with the message that there will be more murders to come. With his good friend Buck, Jim decides to use his learned investigation skills, no matter how limited, to try to solve the mystery before others are found dead. With team works so well together that the police seem to be one step behind them. Jim becomes an important part of the case, even with small matter he knows a little too much about the woman involved. He comes the conclusion that the women being threatened are cheerleaders from his high school. Who would want these women dead after forty years later and why.I must admit I didn't think that a story about a senior citizen wanna-be private investigator was going to be so entertaining, but was I wrong. This book proves that even an old dog can have a sharp mind to look at details and figure out leads to solve a difficult case.  With its  humor, and friendly banter between characters and with some steamy sexy scenes, this book packs a lot between its covers. Adults of any age would find the characters likable, the plot integrating, and will find it a great mystery. I liken it to a cup of tea brewed, not too hot and not too cold, sweet with a little honey with no need for the cream.",1
"I know that last part of my title sounds weird but it's true. Children will love the simplistic adventures of Dorothy and friends while fan of Tim Burton will wonder why he hasn't requested the rights to make these into movies. Baum imagination truly runs a little too wild at times.With characters such as a sawhorse made of wood, a glass kitten with pink brains (you can see them work!) and the Hungry Tiger who prefers the taste of babies but won't eat them because of his conscience you gotta wonder if Baum and Burton are related in any way.Either way, for only $0.99 it's worth your time.OH, but don't expect pictures! The description promises you illustrations but it's a lie. No illustrations were found in my copy. Just blank pages where they were supposed to be.",1
Rating:  4 1/2 starsI was provided a copy of this book from the author for the purpose of an honest review.  I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility.What makes Kallysten's stories so good is it's not all about the sex.  She develops the story first and the romance between characters is just icing on the cake.  We have vampires and humans fighting against demons.  It's a story you can finish in just a couple of hours and because it's so short you will find it difficult to put down.  The action and suspense are what will hold your attention right up until the end where you'll be left wanting to read more.  And you'll be happy to note that the second and third books titled Blurred Bloodlines and Blurred Memories are also currently available.,1
"This story is 'told by the author' rather than experienced by the reader. It's an eye-opener to the lifestyle of immigrants who follow ancient cultures and beliefs even while in this country -- at least as told from the perspective of a child's experience. I'm sure the pain and suffering descriptions are accurate at least for some people, but it's hard to read, hard to track what time period is being described, and sometimes hard to figure out who is on stage.",0
"I didn't like this book, I haven't read any of the books in this series. I just don't think this book is for me, however someone else may like it.....Maya Banks is a great author.",0
"Right off the bat I have to say the character development is epic!  My emotions were all over the place with this one.  The main characters made me angry, sad, and frustrated but yet I want them to work and be happy!  Crazy huh?  Because Kalleysten has taken the time to develop these interesting characters, it was easy to purchase the next book in the series.  (I was given a copy of Blurred Nights in exchange for an honest review.) Although I have to admit I would like to see certain characters end up together, I can't wait to see how the rest of the story is written.  This was a great start to the series although I think a prologue about vampire/human pacts would have been helpful.  After you read this one be prepared to order the next!",1
"The premise of this book is neat: a crew of an experimental sub goes through something extraordinary and finds themselves in a future where society has broken down. At the same time, a few survivors of an alien attack on Mars must make their way back to Earth via capture by the aliens. It was interesting at first but I found many of the characters were easily interchangeable, mainly the leaders of the two groups and the military men on Mars. In fact, one of the latter was so easily overlooked as to stop existing in the middle of the book! He wasn't killed, didn't wander off of the space ship and get lost, no suspended animation or the equivalent; he just stopped existing in the story. Clapton, where are you?The characters also seem to spend a lot of time thinking about the opposite sex even though their lives are all in danger almost constantly. The female who is nominally in charge of the sub when the captain and 3 other members of the crew go ashore, is so worried about the captain (though not the other 3 people) that she sends two more people out into the unknown to find him. And none of the other crew members went, ""Wait. What?""Now the captain phones home and says, ""we're fine but you need to recall those men because there are bands of dangerous people wandering around who could kill them."" This news is passed onto our two wandering rescuers who promptly throw more wood on their fire. If this is the gene pool for humanity, we're in serious trouble.At this point, I don't think I'll finish the book even though I'm 60% through it. I have too many others interesting books on my list to fight my way through this.",0
"okay I don't know what the other 2 reviewers read but what I read was really crap.  It was wrong on so many levels it's hard to know where to start. Set in a slightly dystopian future,  most of the world population is gone,  and the world is divided into masters and pets.  So far,  so interesting.  However,  we get Jiri,  who is male,  but is completely female in all his characteristics, you could make him a woman and only change the pronouns and it would still work (or not)  So Jiri is beautiful, fragile, feminine, virginal and his lover is obsessed with his inexperience and jealous of any experience he may or may not have - which is such an old virginal set up,  and surely we've outgrown it. Then the entire plot momentum is about misunderstandings, which just grew old fast,  and Jiri bringing his mother's influence and good manners to the camp, civilizing the rough men etc...This is a wall banger for me,  I wouldn't recommned it to anyone and will never read it again.",0
"Horrible!  No reasoning for the attraction.  The young character does nothing in his actions to make you feel like he is a man and not a boy.  This makes the older character look very bad.  There is nothing to bring your mind out of thinking this is a tatally inappropriate relationship, not based on the younger man's age so much as he is young, acts young and is put under the older mans care.Do i think a story with a relationship between an older man and an 18 year old is ok?  Yes, if it is told right.  Not here.  There is just no character development at all.",0
"Cassidy is in love with her ex boyfriend Ian.  While they focus on their friendship and business partnership, she can't help but continue to love him.  They share a house and their lives but that is all.  Cassidy wants more.Ian is scared to commit.  Scared of being hurt he pushes away those that mean the most to him; hence why he and Cassidy are now friends instead of the lovers Ian wants them to be.Kye McClellan is a gypsy of sorts. A jack of all trades, he enjoys helping out where he is needed.  He never stays in any place too long before he wants to enjoy freedom again.  When he goes home with Cassidy to help her with her business and financial records, Kye never expected to suddenly want a home and hearth.  And that scares the heck out of him. Before he leaves, however, he will try his best to get Ian and Cassidy together in each other's arms, where they belong not knowing that he will want to be the final part of their triad.Not a typical m&eacute;nage romance, Our Man Friday is a bit different.  I am used to having one couple already established prior to inviting a third and so the fact that Ian and Cassidy were just friends was original to me.  Cassidy's invitation to Kye was a bit far fetched because in this day and age, I don't see anyone inviting an unknown stranger into their home to sort through and look at financial records.  Kye was hot, I'll give him that but he angered me more than once the times he left Ian and Cassidy.  Ian and Cassidy's relationship evolved into something beautiful thanks to Kye.Our Man Friday by Claire Thompson is erotic and naughty.  The emotions of the characters are realistic but I just didn't buy into Kye's commitment to Ian and Cassidy.  I felt he was gratuitous towards them.  As a m&eacute;nage, Our Man Friday is scorching hot; as a true love match between all three characters of the m&eacute;nage? Not so much. I would skip this book unless you are a die hard Claire Thompson fan.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",0
I found this story a wee bit far fetched although it was enjoyable to a point.  I suppose that it was as good as others I have read but perhaps not so believable in real life.  I wish that I could have found a millionaire to kidnap me but I guess I didn't have the right attributes except for being blonde.  It was easy to pick up and put down when interrupted.,0
"What a fabulous Undone!! I loved it! Knowing this short story is a delicious appetizer for The Diamonds of Welbourne Manor by Diane Gaston, Amanda McCabe, and Deb Marlowe made it even better. There's more!From the moment I met Margaret Lewis I was cheering for her, and I fell in love with Captain Graham Veall before he walked onto the page. My heart broke for Graham, and yet Margaret was simply perfect for him. And I just about burst into tears at the end. This is why I love romance stories. *wild applause*",1
It started out really good and kept my inerest but sometime during the mid to end it ended up  losing its luster somewhat... I think it had to do with the killers because it was too predictable and wouldhaveliked more of a surprise. But overall a pretty fun read and I would recommend this for anyone looking to read something fast paced for a bit of entertainment.,1
"As I was reading this story, I was surprised to find that it was a take on the Legend of La Llorona.  I grew up in New Mexico and so am familiar with it.  She was never violent towards other people, except for her own children.  So it's hard for me to imagine the ghost killing so many people in such a violent manner.",0
This book didn't emerse me in the characters minds or  the villains minds but almost just a bit more and I would have given five stars.,1
So normally when I read romance novels I get mad at the female lead for being too passive. In this book I actually got annoyed with how stubborn she was being and felt bad for Jake who I felt she was kind of jerking around a bit at times. It was a good book though. I had already read a previous book with some of the same characters and I liked it as well. Mcdavid is definitely an author I'll keep an eye on in the future.,0
"This book pulled at my heart strings as I connect with the afterlife in my personal life. The stories were heartfelt, and one thing I liked about them is they were not all sugar coated. Sometimes the messages from beyond the grave are not always what we want to hear, or think our loved ones will tell us. I find that spirits I didn't know when they were alive are even more candid about their former lives and death.  Good book!",1
"After reading the first book &#34;on your knees&#34;  and returning it quickly, I figured I would try a second book by this author to see if the first one was just a poor choice.  Well this one wasn't much better.  It certainly isn't worth $5, wait for it to be on a .99 sale.  I was very disappointed.",0
"Grace is not your typical mother to a nine year old son. She burns cookies, sucks at housework, and generally has to make a huge effort to be domestic. What is she good at? Being a super agent of course. Nine years before, pregnant, shot by her lover Alex, the child's father; she makes a career change. Alex in the meantime has put together the Devlin agency and maintains two personages--that of Sean Devlin whom Grace thinks of as a best friend and confident as well as Alex Rossi, super agent! Grace has no idea that they are the same person. For some reason she never asks Sean why Alex shot her. She just assumes he put the job before her life and in order to achieve his objective to bring the bad guy down that is holding her hostage--he shoots her in order to get him.The story has so many unbelievable scenarios that in order to enjoy it for what it is--romantic suspense--you kind of have to suspend your belief in logic.This is a fast easy read. Don't expect it to make sense in terms of logic, plot etc. Stacey is weak on plot, but her dialogue and characters are fairly strong.",0
"This is a solid thriller with strong characters and varied sub plots. It is a very modern tale, centered on bio-terrorism, and cyberspace intrigue. I feel as though Mr. Ross did an excellent job developing all aspects of the story and it is an entertaining read overall.As to why I gave it only three stars...the editing left much to be desired. Though it may sound picky, typos and other copy errors can ruin what is otherwise a great effort by an author. If you look past these things, then Effected Intent is worthy of another star based on the merits of the story. I would not be reluctant to read more by this author.",0
"Author and editors should do a better job of proofing -- especially for word usage.  Lots of misuses of ""then"" and ""than,"" ""passed"" and ""past,"" and ""accept"" and ""except.""  These errors were found throughout all three books.Aside from that, the characters were mercurial, and prone to over-blown prose; the dialog was easy to follow, if occasionally overwrought; the philosophical discussions were completely pedestrian (how many times will ""free will"" versus ""fate"" be debated?!?); the characters were sometimes inconsistent, sometimes too stiff, and other times quite engaging; and often the foreshadowing was heavy-handed.Even with all these faults, I enjoyed reading the series.",0
"Short, sexy story about ""straight"" college roommates discovering they might not be so straight after all. This is a fun Gay For You fantasy about what might happen if two male friends pushed their sexual boundaries. Nobody writes apprehensive sexual tension better than Evangeline Anderson.

"A supernatural and totally unbelievable story.... And I'm not talking about  the Whole angel coming to earth thing, I actually liked the twist, my problem is with the I have sex And fall in love in an hour part!!!

Too corny for me, but we are all different in whAt we like to read.

"Bill Morison relates his experiences as a novice work comp auditor for a large insurance company, a job he finds pointless and boring, in a book that is unfortunately pointless and boring.I'm usually a fan of workplace humor.  Ideally, the author strips away the mundane majority of the work experience, leaving only the enjoyable and/or amusing bits.  Unfortunately, this author manages to find only mundanity.  For instance, he spends more than 200 mundane words (""There was a path leading from the parking lot to the pavilion. [...] It was at this entrance that I found the standard park grill."") describing the pavilion at which the company picnic was held - a description with absolutely no relevance to any of the picnic events.  He describes the teambuilding games at the picnic as ""worthless,"" provides no other information beyond a listing of games, and then tells the reader that they were the most fun he'd had at the company.  If they were fun, then show the fun!Leaving aside my lack of appreciation of the author's humor, this book has other flaws.- It contains a random creepy advertisement for another of his books,Legon Awakening: Book One in the Legon Series.  ""It's so good and the author's voice--so hot,"" and ""...but he does have a sexy voice and the story is great,"" says Bill's coworker Adrian.- It contains random and uninteresting IM conversations between Bill (screen name Bmorisson, or sometimes Bmorrison, but never an accurate spelling of his last name) and Adrian (screen name HorseChick - there's got to be a story behind *that* as your workplace IM name, but unfortunately we don't learn what it is).Bmorisson ""hey you're on the EAC right?""HorseChick ""yeah why? If your going to complain about the pot luck last week I don't want to hear it; wasn't my idea""Bmorisson ""chill. I wasn't going to say anything about that. I'm supposed to be in the meeting this week; does that mean I'm on the committee? Oh and pot lucks are dumb.""HorseChick ""lol don't make me walk over there! [...]""- The dialogue is stilted, superfluous, or both.""Hey bro, how's it going?""""I'm good, you?""""I'm doing good.""- Compound words are written as two separate words (pot luck, ""Halloween was making a come back""), and separate words as compound words (""Everyday, he wore khaki pants with a faded polo"").  Not just once or twice, but over and over.- Sentences are randomly strung together.  ""It was a local number some 720 one.""- The author picks the wrong word.  ""She straitened a bit.""  ""My arms were wound around her waste..."" ""...women that all wore sandals, heals, flip flops..."" ""It sounds like your trying to get rid of me."" ""Never did loosing your job seem to affect me.""Two stars because the grammatical issues aren't bad enough to make the book completely unreadable, and because the last 30% is significantly better than the first 70%.  Not enough better to make it worth slogging through the first part, but enough better that ruthless rewrites might have some chance to save it.",0

I am usually a big Delilah Devlin fan. I was surprised how much I did not like this particular book. First it is very much a FFM book. Lots of intimate interaction between the 2 women- way more than eluded to in the description. Second the main female character is 17. YES 17! That just skeeved me out. Sorry Delilah this one fell flat...and had a huge yuck factor for me (the teenager). If either of these details would have been more clear in the description I would have never downloaded the book. That being said I will continue to read this author and hope next time the characters are more tolerable.,0
"If you're in the mood for a quick read, this is it. Great story. I liked the pace and it packed a lot in a short span.",0
"Not realizing it, Holly needed to get her life back from her family who depended on her after the death of her mother. It took Carson to tell her sister what she needed to do, before the family realized what they were doing.",1
"I was looking for an alternative to Financial Times, but find the writing a bit loose, e.g., calling Edward Snowden an &#34;NSA analyst.&#34;  And the extras I was looking for in the Saturday edition aren't any better than the scaled down version FT has now gone to, which is why I was looking for an alternative in the first place.  NYTI won't be it.",0
"Love it, as I have done the whole series yet. The fact that the author pen doesn't tremble to kill key characters is a breeze of fresh air... you never know what is gonna happen",1

"Wow dragons!! Knights!! and Mistress' oh my. smiles I loved it!! A great blend of characters and story line. I just had fun reading this. A bit sassy girl meets a dragon and a Knight and in one day is swept off her feet. I loved the action it was fast paced. The sex was hot, the element that the pleasure of the riders and the best are intertwined. Wait did I mention the sex scenes were hot!! smiles again. A awesome tale that made you want to continue to read and a wee bit sad when you were done. Garath and Lars played the story of mellowing bel very well. Makes one think who played who. Did I mention dragon sex?? along with magic. The Mama dragon is soo endearing you cant help but love her. Its a good thing she has more books in this series. Enjoy",1
This was a wonderful continuation of the fabulous lotto love story. Haven't we all locked eyes with someone on stage somewhere and taken this journey in our imagination at one point in our lives? This story brings that fantasy to life quite well! Great Job!,1
"I thought at first that this would be a real Christian love story like Grace Livingston Hill used to  write, but she would never mix magic into one of her stories. I was disappointed in the story due to that.",0
"It is disappointing that Amazon treat women imagining gay men's sex lives as little more than&#34; if you tried harder you could get over it&#34; and if you were a man this  is how I would like you to do me.Reeks of sexual discrimination and exploitation which, by the way, is an actionable offence in civilised countries.",0
"I'm so disappointed in this book. It had a lot of potential to be great, except for the author inability to make the story more realistic. Of all the Japanese cultural traits' - an assassin, really? This book started off great until you find out the male character is an assassin. It's as if she tried to make this theme work and if failed. I'm so pissed I paid money for this book. This was worth like $1, maybe. The main character is an abused woman that doesn't have enough balls to stand up to her abuser, but will stand up to the man that has safe guarded her life. Um, ""Hellleer""( in my Tyler Perry's Madea voice). It threw me off because the writer never explained where she gained all this strength.  It was really poor execution, and the storyline was unbelievable. It would have been better if the main character was a business man, that if pushed could and would defend what's his. This book is not worth the time. The author should read Pepper Pace's WOS (all her books are great), and she now she connects the storyline with emotion with and believability! Or even Sienna Mynix novels are greatly well written. Don't buy it.",0
"This is one of those books where even when you download the sample, you can still be led astray.  Shannon Stacey is capable of writing funny dialogue and the book gets off to a good start.  Unfortunately for all, this roadtrip runs out of gas very quickly.I`m not sure I have ever a novel with two such pathetic adult lead characters.  Ethan has moved to a new town because his MOTHER got a job there.  Unlike his mother, Ethan has no job.  We learn that his furniture restoration business was ruined by his ex-wife who fled with all the money.  Somehow this grown man was unable to take any sort of legal action and felt fortunate to still have a car.  What?  It gets worse as he is booked on a senior`s trip to Disney World along with his mother.Jill is a children`s librarian who seems to have big dreams that she does nothing to work toward.  Her family mocks her by saying, ""When the going gets tough, Jill gets going.""  Based on her track record this seems pretty accurate.The connection between the two characters seems more juvenile than believable.  Our hero can`t even say the word condom without blushing yet morphs into wanting anal sex in the last few pages.  Had the book stayed in the P.G. world, maybe the innocence would have made sense, but the change in Ethan`s behavior just doesn`t work.  Similarly, in a brilliant Dr. Phil type deduction, Ethan blames Jill`s lack of gumption on her family who have destroyed her self-esteem by telling her the truth.It appears that the two of them will limp along bankrolled by Ethan`s mom, who luckily meets a new man more interesting than her son.Toss in a police chief with narcolepsy and you have a story that makes you want to yell GAK!",0
"I found this book to be light reading for a British mystery.  The story line has already left me, after only 2 weeks, but I do remember that when Aggie Underhill turns up on the scene the police think here we go again.....",0
"Book 1 of Granite Lake Wolfes - Wolf Signs is just great. The use of a character who is deaf and very independent is wonderful. Robyn Maxwell is delightful and just what Keil needs as a mate. I'm so used to ""Perfect"" wolves that having Keil's brother be a clumsy wolf was a great idea.This story was a great lead in to the series and while it's not a long read, approx. 90 pages, the price is good and there are at least 5 other books. Love it!",1
"The writing was good and definitely pumped up the steam, but it's definitely not for the faint of heart. Be warned to expect m/m m/f and m/f/m but judging by the description you probably already figured that out. I would have liked to have had the story elaborated further and had a little more background for the characters and the world the story takes place but this is a great set up for more in the series and there weren't any moments when I was questioning anything in the story. Overall it was a good well rounded read with interesting characters that worked well in the short novella format.",1
"Fun, fast read. If you are looking for a one day read, this book fills the bill. Lots of likable characters, some evil ones too and humor  to lighten up the plot. Enjoy!",0
"Review Courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A tear jerker story involving a threesome and struggles to find out what is most important in life: Love.Opening Sentence: ""You tramp.""The Review:If you read the synopsis of this book, it sounds a lot like a fun, steamy m&eacute;nage-love-triangle-type romance.  There is sure to be lots of sexual tension and participation, right?  WRONG!  There should be some kind of sticker put on the back of this book: WARNING - may contain highly emotional content that may not be suitable for all readers.  Oh sure, Shiloh Walker tells you AT THE END of the book, but at that point you are already read the emotionally hard parts.Playing for Keeps starts out as a story about three people: Dana, the free spirited woman looking for commitment-free fun, Mason, the current lover that provides the fun, and Jake, the love torn on-again-off-again boyfriend of the woman he loves that flees at the hint of relationship-related seriousness.  Mason is an excuse in this book, so for the most part it is all about Jake and Dana.  The book starts off with Jake sharing Dana with another man; the only way he is able to be with Dana without her freaking out.  It moves along to just Dana and Jake when they find out they are going to be surprise parents.  Then, unfortunately, moves into a terrible tragedy that threatens their fledgling relationship.  Can their love survive?Jake is like a lovesick puppy, following around the object of his desire over the course of years.  When he does get the chance to snag Dana, he grabs on with both hands.  There is not a lot of seething rage toward the man that he must share his love with.  Don't get me wrong, he hates Mason, but he wants Dana happy more and the m&eacute;nage relationship makes her so.  When he finds out that she is pregnant, he steps up to the plate and takes responsibility.  Good man.  I really liked the realism that Jake gives off.  I like seeing him respond with Dana's wishes in mind, instead of just his own.Dana, on the other hand, likes to play.  She is not the type of woman that thinks about settling down and starting a family as being her top priority.  So when news of an unexpected baby arrives, she is forced to reevaluate her life.  And when her heart is heavy with loss, she discovers what is truly important to her.  It was nice to see the growth bloom within Dana's character.  Even though the story itself is rather on the skimpy side of size, nothing about any of the character's developments seems rushed.***SPOILER ALERT***Now let's move to the part that I warned you about earlier.  The loss of an unborn child is tremendous.  You do not have to hold the baby in your arms to love it and feel the weight of their loss.  From personal experience, the sadness does not ever go away, just lessens enough for you to function.  Sad to say that in this type of tragedy, sometimes the men are overlooked in terms of grief.  Most relationships do not last after losing a child; either parent cannot deal with their grief or that of their partner's.  But there are some that grow closer in the aftermath.  Ms. Walker and I are two such cases.  I applaud her in sharing the story of her and her husband's  own experience with her readers, no matter how much it hurt personally to read and experience these events all over again.  And though I am happy with the ending of this book, I most likely will not re-read it anytime soon.***END SPOILER***Shiloh Walker is known for her dramatic prose and hard/dark themes.  Her writing will touch you, no matter your circumstances, long after the book is done.  I highly recommend any of her many stories, from her contemporary romances, to the paranormal and erotic.  But I, again, warn you that this one in particular can be an emotional roller coaster.  If you start crying, don't say that I didn't tell you ahead of time.FTC Advisory: The author provided me with a copy of Playing for Keeps.  No goody bags, sponsorships, ""material connections,"" or bribes were exchanged for my review.  The only payments I receive are hugs and kisses from my little boys.",0
Love this series currently reading book 3 and i love this one. Give this series a try you wont be disappointed.,1
"I initially bought the official K2 leather cover, and it was generally fine.  But I eventually decided that I'd like a cover/case that completely encloses and cushions the Kindle, as I tend to carry it around a lot, toss it in the car during trips, etc.  So I bought the Belkin Neoprene Sleeve Case after seeing and reading about it on Amazon.  And, happily, it turned out to be a great purchase, handsome and functional.  I especially like the way the cushioning inside isolates the Kindle from the zipper, so there's no danger (unless you're really, really careless, or maybe drunk) of scratching your Kindle while zipping or unzipping the case.And even though this is a soft product, there's just enough stiffness to the Belkin Case to prevent the material from settling down and sitting on the Kindle screen when you place the covered device down somewhere.  Though there's really no harm if that does occur, as the Kindle sits snugly in the case and won't move around and create friction between the inside surface and the screen.So, yeah, this is a very nice product, and it's economically priced, to boot.  Why not five stars, then?  Well, unlike the stiff official K2 cover, this is still a soft case that won't allow you to safely place anything of weight on top of it, so the Kindle will always have to be on top of any pile of things you're carrying or placing in a carry-all bag.  And I always have to take the extra, perhaps slightly inconvenient, step of making sure my grip is pressuring the keyboard area, not the more sensitive screen area, when I'm carrying the case around.  But these are quibbles.  There's yet to be a Kindle case or cover that perfectly addresses all concerns, and maybe it's not realistic to expect one.So, for now, if you're looking for a cushioned case that completely protects the Kindle from weather, scratches, minor bumps, and other things along these lines, you can't go wrong with the Belkin Case.",1
"I gave it 4 stars because it was a pretty good book, however it was my least favorite of the 3.  I did not like the character Enin at all, I found the character to be rigid and boring and the book was consumed with this character.  Overall, I liked the story but did not like the elimination of some characters and the continuation of others.",1
"When I started this book it has so much promise, I mean it's set in Fiji, an island of sunny beaches, and tropical landscapes. Seriously how can you go wrong with that, well this author surely did.I mean this book is so filled with angst, sex, angst filled sex, and an ending so disappointing I wanted to cry.All throughout the book Marek feels sorry for himself, for what happened to his dead lover, and for what he did to Colin way back in High School. As the reader you don't get to know what he did until the ending, and let me tell you that it was enough for me to want him to die in a fire.Yeah, he was getting on my nerves with all his emo bulls***, and then he let what he did surface, and that was it I was done.Colin should have kicked him in the balls then left while Marek was puking his guts out on the floor. This would have been an appropriate HEA, not the crappy one where he takes the looser back.",0
"NEVER WANT TO DOWNGRADE ANY AUTHORS WRITINGS BECAUSE SOMEONE IS BOUND TO LIKE IT. LOVE READING BOOKS THAT DIP INTO YOUR IMAGINATION BUT THIS ONE JUST DIDN'T DO IT FOR ME.  PAGES AND PAGES OF WORDS AND YET IT WAS STILL CONFUSING ON WHY THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS STAYED APART FOR SOOOOOOOOO LONG (at some point is shows 3 MONTHS LATER).  THERE WAS A MURDER WHICH STARTED THE SEPARATION BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THIS UNTIL TOWARDS THE END BECAUSE THE ONLY MENTION IT GETS IS WHEN SHE (MAIN CHARACTER) WAKES UP THINKING ABOUT IT AND THAT'S THE ONLY TIME YOU GET ANY HINT THAT IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  GETTING TO THE END OF THE BOOK THE TWO CHARACTERS KINDA START TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND THAT'S WHEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS. BUT, I DID NOT LIKE THE END.",0
"Hey folks,Prior to ""Missle Rats,"" my experience with Ms. Bevill has been limited to her ""Bubba"" books, and I have to say that I like her Bubba books quite a bit.  I think they are funny, and I really like the characters she has created.  I would go so far as to say I feel like I am ""invested"" in her Bubba characters.  One grows to care what happens to them.With this book, however, the author lost me in the fourth paragraph when she has the protagonist relate his daydreaming in social studies class while he picks his nose.  He then tells the reader that picking his nose helps him think more clearly.  What?  I don't know who would find this topic interesting, but once I was past first or second grade, this sort of ""bathroom humor"" no longer seemed funny or interesting.  It just seemed it was undignified, out of place, and just plain foolish.Within a few more pages, the author has a Marine recruiter tell the protagonist he will become the ""biggest, baddest, mother------ in the whole damn state of Louisiana.""  I spent my whole career working for the Department of Defense, and I spent quite a bit of time with recruiters from all of the services.  Based on my life experience, would I expect a Marine recruiter might say such a thing? Absolutely.  Then again, I have heard that same vulgarity (and many others) from co-workers, neighbors, and many other folks in many places.  In spite of that fact, I think the author's point could have been made without the use of that vulgarity.  It was another turn-off for me.  I think gratuitous vulgarity simply becomes boring.As I have already noted, I was put off by the time I had read the fourth paragraph, but I think I would not have liked this book even without the items I noted above.  As something of an autobiographical story of her time in the service, I simply did not find it interesting.  I am not sure what she wanted me to receive from the book, but it was not a good story to me.  As I continued on with the book, I found myself skimming the pages just to get to the end.Besides the ""Bubba"" books, I have several other books by Mz. Bevill to read, and I hope I find more of her stories to like.  She certainly makes me happy reading about Bubba.Best wishes,Dave Wile",0
"The story is interesting, if you can make sense of it despite the formatting. The story has multiple characters and we jump between their point of views. We also jump back in time before the apocalypse. Not normally a big deal - except that there is nothing to separate these sections.You're reading a section with Harris and in the next paragraph, you're with Nero. There's nothing to separate the change of venue. Normally, an author uses chapters to switch characters, a line or an extra paragraph space. Not in this book - not my copy, anyway. And the time change.. what a mess - extremely confusing. There was a part where Harris goes back in his memories. It took me a few sentences to realize what happened. And then when we're brought back to the present - again, no separator. This lack of formatting removes any smoothness in the reading.. it's like driving on a bumpy road.There is a lot of military description - weaponry, tactics. If you aren't interested in it, you can skim it. The story itself, the world it's in is interesting on its own, as are the characters. The battle at the end captured my imagination - by then, I was used to the character changing lack of format and adapted a little better.",0
"this is a very short story, ended all of a sudden (when I bought it, I hadn't realized that it was so short), and I was glad that I had only spent $1, because it was a waste of money.  this should have been a freebie.",0
This was a good mix of historical fact and fantasy. Might be read for older children with a caution that there is some violence involved.,1
"PLOT: Stacy is lonely and decides to make a pass at Nash, an attractive wolf shifter. She's annoyed when he turns her down. Nash is attracted to Stacy, but he doesn't want to lose his position as pack leader by chosing a human as his mate.PROS: I thought Nash and Stacy were likeable and sounded attractive. The story begins very well.CONS: I had a hard time respecting Nash and Stacy. Both of them made so many poor decisions that were stupid and born out of obstinance. I actually found this story to be depressing. I believed that Nash and Stacy were hot for each other. I don't think they knew each other enough to love each other. That Stacy knows that Nash and his friends are werewolves contradicts the original story where her friend is told that if she tells anyone, she will be killed. At the end, the author skips two years. After this, two important characters are brought up, but neither of them are given names. (I can't give away who they are without giving away key plot points.) Alphons actions at the end of the book seemed unlikely and pointless. The ending was abrupt. An epilogue would have been nice.2 STARS: I'd been looking forward to this one since the series seemed to be improving as it went along. I think this is the worst in the series.",0
"So strangely written; choppy and disjointed. Also, so completely unrealistic yet clich&eacute;. Matt is an alcoholic. Neither character is emotionally available for a relationship. The whole thing is a ridiculous, sappy train wreck.",0
"The cover is very good. The tabs to lock it in place are horrible. The first time I opened the case I could see the Kindle case flexing. Then I read some of the other reviews about the problems it caused with the kindles. I managed to remove the tabs, and just use the cover. This works well. I just wonder if they bothered even testing these. The problems seem so obvious, it should have never been put in production without modifications.",0
This book was downloaded for free on Amazon Kindle. I have started to read this book but it didn't keep my interest so I never finsihed it.,0
Not really into the whole werewolf scenarios.  I may be one of very few whole had no interest in the whole Twilight thing.  This book was free and a quick read is the only reason I read it.  I think if the werewolf story line was left out I would have given it a better review.  Just not my cup of tea,0
"This was a guilty pleasure kind of book. The 'vengeance' aspect seems highly implausible and quaintly old-fashioned. The heroine is so principled it hurts, and the hero (who frankly must be a bit dumb if his vengeance idea is any indicator) suitably rich and handsome. But overall, it is harmless fun HEA.",0
"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 5/10PROS:- Anderson captures the annoying-yet-somehow-still-endearing antics of college boys quite well: the wrestling, the teasing, the constant put-downs, etc.- As much as I was annoyed at the two guys' refusal to just admit to their attraction for each other, I can't deny the fact that I snickered every time the phrase ""double dare extreme gay chicken"" (or something similar) came up.- There's a bit of angst, but it's the right amount for the story. It adds a bit of conflict without carrying on for too long.CONS:- Tall, burly men who play soccer are not entirely unheard of, but the majority of soccer players are average-sized or even smaller-than-average because there's such a call for speed and agility in the sport. The moment I read that our two heroes in this story are the stars of their college soccer team and are 6'4"" and 6'5"", I couldn't help rolling my eyes a bit at the impression of sensationalism I got. Add to that the fact that goalkeepers in soccer are generally referred to as ""keepers"" rather than ""goalies"" (as the story refers to them), and the entire setting lost its believability for me.- As soon as I lost the fight to prevent my eyes from rolling the first time, I was a goner. SO much about this story was silly to me: straight roommates who not only sleep in the same bed, but also cuddle, ""their bodies touching, their arms around each other""? Please. Guys who are so competitive that they'll go as far as kissing each other in a game of ""gay chicken"" just to prove how macho they are? Right.Overall comments: I would certainly pass on reading this ever again. It's not badly written; I just couldn't get past the premise. Every contrived situation the men found themselves in made me curl my lip yet again, and although I liked the protagonists okay, I was annoyed enough by their inability to admit their feelings that I didn't care too much about how things ended up.",0
"Wow! At first I was confused and didn't know what to make of Kaylee but I quickly got hooked on this one. Keep in mind that this is a 0.5 prequel to the regular series, so it's just a ""sampling"" of what's to come.  It may not make a whole lot of sense, but once you read book 1, you'll understand the reason for it.  Keep reading, give this series a chance, get to at least book 2 - you'll be hooked by then for sure!  I am definitely going to keep reading this series! Fascinating!",1
"This is a very short story that actually has more verbal foreplay than actual spicy bits - I never thought I'd complain about that!  From the synopsis, I thought this book would be different to what it was.  Still enjoyable but could quite easily have done with a few more words, if only to make it up to a Novella.  There is a big world within this story that we only see a smidgeon of.Good coffee break book and with lots of excerpts from other books in case you were looking for anymore.",0
"I never like leaving a bad review because I know this book is the creation of someone who worked very hard to write it.  However, it really lacked anything truly new.  I guess the concept of how a werewolf is ""activated"" is a bit novel, but the plot and simplicity of the story prevented me from giving it a higher rating.  It was very short and everything magically ""all worked out in the end"" with little development of the characters.  I am sorry to say that I do not plan to read anymore more books in this series.",0
"This ebook was supplied to me free to read and review.This book grabbed me from the first page, although the plot is unlikely, to put it mildly, where everyone can seemingly be bought if the price is right. Eric the main character by an initial misfortune gets involved with drug smuggling and as his daughter is threatened he has no choice but to continue. Eric works his way up the drug smuggling organisation and although extreme violence and high body count the violence is almost so over the top that it just adds to the atmosphere rather than shocks. All of the characters are well developed and the plot is quite straightforward although there is a twist at the end it again does not seem likely.Summary an action packed book where you have to suspend belief but very readable with some good ideas. If you like smuggling, gang warfare, murders and extortion you will like this.",1
This book makes so much sense and it's practices are easy to follow I've read many books on this subject and this by far is the easiest to apply thank you for the helpful strategies.,1
"I have read tons of books, and this is one of the best books I've ever read! Imagine the concept of a hitch-hiking serial killer being picked up by a serial killer! It's hilarious! I've read all the versions and prequels and sequels that Kilborn and Crouch wrote about these characters, and let me tell you they are all great! They have some really twisted minds, and I love that. Kinda reminds me of myself lol. Keep it up you two, because I want to read more of your stuff! And don't ever hitchhike!!!",1

"2 out of 5 stars. This is an intriguing suspenseful romance. It's about a huge secret--finding out you had a child with a woman you don't know or don't remember--and trying to figure out how to deal with the consequences and rewards of learning this unsuspected news. Yet, once the &#34;cat is out of the bag&#34; the mother (Kate) finds that having her life on display in the tabloids starts bringing in some scary pranks that put her and her son's lives on the line. Will they be able to keep everyone safe while finding out the truth about what really happened?This is a captivating novel in the way that no matter how much it dragged on for me I was interested in how it would end and what would happen between Kate, Lane, & their son. Together Kate & Lane just worked, especially when everything seemed to be going against them.If I didn't feel like I had to push through this novel because of it dragging for me, then I would have given this a better rating. As I enjoyed the main characters & their friends, while the &#34;enemy&#34; always seemed to change for me. I kept trying to guess who the person doing the &#34;pranks&#34; was and--even though I wasn't completely surprised about who it was--I was shocked by the extremes she went through.Nevertheless, I will admit not to enjoying how the reveal of Kate's son's paternity played out. For me ... if Lane didn't go from finding out (at the end of the novel) the real truth of things, then (in a way) acting like he was saying &#34;oh yeah, now I remember and I did really like/love her,&#34; then running away from Kate, and then the following day try to make amends (in a big way) with no real explanation ... I would have also liked it better. =0/Therefore, I would only recommend this to those who are big fans of Ms. Munro.Review By: From Me to You ...

"Well written and well executed, but way too far into the macabre and out of my comfort zone for me to give it a five star rating. I'd love to read something by these guys a little less graphic and a lot longer!",0
"The Idea of government paired marriages was an interresting twist and that is why I downloaded this book. The execution was unfortunately very weak and immature. The whole story felt a bit like a high school home work. I never realy grew to like the main character Rainy and I don't understand why anyone would want to be matched for marriage at the age of 21. Even I for whom English is a second language, was disturbed by the lack of good editing. Two and a half stars for the interresting idea of government match making.",0
"Awesome trio of books. If you love cc cowboys in modern day & err romance, then you will definitely enjoy these stories.",1
I liked it. It was a good story and I want to read more books by this author. Will be buying more.,1
Written in a different era it still enthralls. I read Bulldog Drummond as a kid and it seemed wonderful then. It is still good now but the writing is dated and some expressions and points of view are clearly politically incorrect. Steer past that and the stories are fun to read and like James Bond for the early 20th Century. The writing reminds me of the Biggles books.,1
"I love the series and bought them all, but I didn't know that this book is the same as The Charmer, but really short! I wasted money. :( The author should have stated this. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, BUY THE CHARMER!!!",0
"Yep filled with perfect menage sex.  Kylie, Colt and Heath are very sexual and it all comes together in a quick hot read.  Loved it.",1
"Well, if you like reading about erotic threesome encounters with two hunks than this is the book for you. Most of it was not practical being the ladies first encounter but it is short and sweet.  I would have liked to pay less to read it but what else is there to do on a  rainy afternoon. I would have liked a much longer book with more of a story line with the erotosism sprinkled throughout instead of on every page.  I may look into the rest of the series to see if it all ties in. Enjoy.",1
"I don't like to write bad reviews...but this just had to be said:This book was bad!  It had the possibility to be pretty good but the execution wasn't there.First of all it seemed like the author just took a little bit of vampire lore from every vampire story there is.  Which wouldn't be bad in itself, except that I felt like it was almost a parody at times.  Kinda like that movie ""Vampire's Suck"" that makes fun of all the vampire movies.I REALLY, really, really, did not like the ""heroine"" of this story.  I don't even like calling her that. She had no depth, and was a spoiled, self-centered, vapid young girl.  She had no brains, and might as well have walked around with a sign on her neck saying, ""Here I am come kill me!""  Her character is really what made this book awful.Here's the story:Brian is a vampire and lives across the street from ""the girl of his dreams"".  (I think this exact phrase was used at least 10 times in the story, although I really think it must have been nightmares!)  Besides the usual vampire powers (strength, speed, agility, and mind control) he can dream walk and spirit walk.  He's pretty obsessed with Heather (the girl across the street).  He basically stalks her dreams and follows her around in a spirit walk.  The book starts off where he is spirit walking and follows her to an abandoned home where she and her friends like to party.  Heather leaves the party just as men in suits come to haul all of her friends off.  (We don't know where.)  Brian ""suggests"" that Heather come to his house so that he can keep her safe.  Their journey begins as they try to escape the mysterious agents who have been tracking them down.  The weird thing is that they aren't after Brian (because he's a vampire), they are actually after Heather (although I don't know why, she could make anyone want to just gag her and put her in the trunk).I felt like Brian was a pretty accurate description of a teenage boy- hungry all the time and thinking about sex when he wasn't eating.  I really never understood what he saw in Heather except that she was beautiful.  (Which again, would be true to form for a teenage boy).This is not something I would want my pre-teen daughter to read, because of the way that the female lead was portrayed and some mild sexual content.",0
"I've been trying a few of the Kindle newspapers and this was one of the first I grabbed as I am more interested in State politics and the Texas Longhorns. I found this to be a decent read knowing up front from all the reviews that none of the Kindle newspapers seem to be just like getting the actual paper in print. I guess with that in mind I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. I do get what I am looking for. There seems to be a decent amount of State politics and usually some articles on the Longhorns. I've got a couple more Texas newspapers to review yet but unless I get an unexpected surprise, this will be the one I end up subscribing to. If you are a Longhorn nut like myself, I'd like to suggest the ""Burnt Orange Nation"" blog for your Kindle. It has numerous daily blogs which many are lengthy - sent daily (sometimes several times a day) to your Kindle and keeps you right on top of the Longhorn happenings.",1

"I thought Sleepwalker: the Last Sandman was very well written and incredibly entertaining.  This indie author is bursting with talent.  I understand this is a YA book but it is tremendously enjoyable for adults as well.The story itself was interesting and fun.  It was a sort of story in a story, but did not get unnecessarily complicated or confusing.  The book takes place in two different worlds and again, it was not confusing.  Also, it was easy to envision the dream world from all the descriptions.  The characters were all fully developed and not flat or two dimensional at all.  I liked everything about this book - story, characters and their development, vivid descriptions, and great imagination.My favorite parts of the book were when Jake would tell a story.  They were captivating tales and they fit right into the story.Well done, Brad Marlowe.  I sincerely hope that there is another book in the works.",1
"First off, I'm a fan of well written erotica. This wasn't it. There was little story with ramped up sex scenes that didn't do it for me.This author is new to me so I won't question her talent. But at this point, I am doubtful if I would but anything else she has written. However if mostly sex is your thing in a book, then this title may be for you.",0
"I recently got into reading period mysteries with the Maisie Dobbs series. After finishing them, I read ""Her Royal Spyness"", which I found to be frivolous and shallow by comparison, so I figured I'd try the Lady Julia Grey bundle, based on the reviews. I was not disappointed. The stories are interesting, with some good plot twists. I wouldn't really call them romances, although they do have a romantic undercurrent, and the dark character of Nicholas Brisbane grows on you after awhile. Lady Julia is a bit too impetuous, but she is a good foil to Brisbane, and I enjoyed the setting of Victorian England. In all, the three books are a good value and very entertaining.",1
"Book size: novella, max location, 2265.Clara is kidnapped and taken to Childbride Island to be trained as child-woman sex toy for Lord Bardwick. She is subject to frequent spankings, embarrassing physical examinations, daily enemas, and being put on display. She is taught to obey and submit to whatever her new papa might do to her.I read the reviews and the description of this book and was looking forward to reading it. It did not live up to my expectations. There is a lot of spanking that happens and that is alright. I have never really cared for it and don't quiet understand the obsession that some people have with it but to each their own. I liked the part about enemas being administered but the book didn't really talk about it. It pretty much just told you that they had them and that is it.To tell the truth I found the book to be a bit boring. I did not find the parts that were supposed to be erotic exciting at all. I like more action in my erotic books, something to actually happen to them and for them to enjoy it. Throughout the whole book Clara only has one orgasm and that was done by a whole lot of touching. She has enemas, plugs put in her, spanked, put on display, rarely touch in a sensual way and often she didn't find much enjoyment in these things. I am fine with almost anything being done to a person as long as they are actually getting real pleasure out of it.One of the other reviews was right. This book read a lot like those old Victorian erotica. If you have read Slaves of the Hypnotist by Bill Adler or First Training by James Jennings then this book reads a lot like those. If you liked the books I mentioned then you probably will like this one too but I didn't care for it.",0
"Good for all you conspiracy theorists, of course. In this case, however, I'm on your side. A short, fast read, it lays out very clearly why world governments would want to hide this sort of information, and presents one of the real reasons, not one I'd thought of before, as to why they'll probably always continue to do so (I won't spoil things by telling you what that is; read it and find out).",0
"This book is a sequel to Derrico's first book, Right Ascension.I gave Right Ascension 4 stars.This is a sequel,  but not quite a sequel,  it is a more of a ""let's get it over with"" type book.Too many characters doing too many things, too quickly, in too many places all at the same time.It is hard to follow and the ""resolution"" is totally unbelievable.",0
The story starts strong but then turns predictable. There are much better shifter novels out there. I think it is over priced for the amount of content.,0
"I just could not get into this book and put it down after only a few chapters.  I bought the second in the series; perhaps I'll give that a try, if I have nothing else to read.",0
"Wow!  What a total waste of my money and time.  I assume this was self-published?  Does the author not have a few friends capable of proofreading the book for her?  I didn't get past the first 5 or 6 pages on my kindle.  Multiple unintelligible sentences in a row was too much for me.  I was trying to ignore the messy and poor writing, but when it reaches the point where you can't even guess what the sentence was supposed to be, it's time to give up.",0
"It's hard for me to say exactly how I felt about this book. Would I recommend it? Maybe to my dad or grandparents. The book was solid and the mystery plot decent, but I felt overwhelmed by info dump and mundane aspects. I found myself just wanting to be through the book so I could be done with it and start another. Yet at the same time I wouldn't say the book was 'bad'. There were parts which held my interest and honestly I was surprised how things turned out. But the description of every meal, every movement around a kitchen to make said meal left me...skimming for the meat of the book. If you are forty/fifty and under, I think you'll find the book slow/dull. If you are late 50's- 60+ or need to pick a present for that age range - this would make a good gift.",0
"Simply put, this was been the best .99 novel I've read yet.  Solid writing, excellent pace, non-cookie cutter characters - who wouldn't love a protagonist with an opium addiction?  I want to have a beer with Mr. Tangerine.  And the cover?  What's wrong with the cover?  It's a beach, get it?  I would have paid $4.99 and not been disappointed.I don't understand what everyone wanted at the end?  Some big confrontation with the mine setter?  A shootout that ends in the death of the evil doer.  C'mon people, what's wrong with changing it up?  A little variety; an odd twist.",1
"R.G. Alexander has got a great imagination!Sexually provocative lakes, cats and birds loving each other, a tin woman who can morph into your heart's desire, and a king without a name!  Kansas from Earth is dropped head first into Oz thanks to the wizard Z who thinks he's just the right kind of man to teach the king a few things about love.  It's quirky, funny, sexy and very hot.  This novella has it all in spades and the land of Oz is not at all like I remember - this one is a hundred times hotter!  Only 4 stars because I wanted it to go on for about a hundred more chapters!  If I could do a half star, it would be right there at 4 1/2 only because I didn't want it to end.  :-)I got this book after picking up the Children of the Goddess series also by R.G. and I'm definitely glad that I did.  I've got Surrender Dorothy (book 2) in my sights as we speak, along with everything else my new favorite author has penned.",1

"What was this, an erotic version of The Purge?So Narda is on a mission, she needs to find Van/Doran or any of the other names she gave him before time runs out. Why? I guess we'll soon find out... *wink, wink*.Inside one of the many erotic clubs on this strange planet, she make her way through a stinky cave of a bar. How cozy. And even though her time is running out, she asks a bartender where to find her charge. Um, how did you know what planet he was on, let alone what bar he was in? There was no mention of a secret Intel. So why not use that same strange ability to find people that she used to find this place? Um, no. You see, we must first gross you out by detailing all the raunchy goings on in this bar. Sure the room is dark, but the bar is lit up, and the hall way is lit up... No, now it's dark. Darn. So after she finally makes it to the room, and all the *wink, wink* happens, I am left with a bitter taste in my mouth. No surprise, this is a Naughty Nooner. :-P",0

"Robyn Maxwell might be deaf but she and her family have not let that stop her.  She is a successful baker and outdoors woman.  But she just can't seem to find a man she wants to date.  She does need a break though and when her brother backs out of their annual trip into the wilderness she decides to go by herself.  What she doesn't' count on is meeting the two others who are there at the same time.  She meets Keil and his brother and is instantly drawn to Keil.Keil is in the process of fighting for alpha of his pack.  He and his brother are taking some time away from the pack to regroup.  Keil never expects to find his mate, and in a woman who doesn't even know she is a wolf.  Suddenly everything seems to be happening to him at once...  Not quite the relaxing time he expected.  Will Keil and Robyn mate?  Will Keil win the alpha challenge?Wolf Signs takes an interesting twist to the normal wolf meets girl story.  Robyn is unique as she is deaf.  I found the premise of this story fantastic.  I love to see ""non perfect heroines"".  There is great potential for this series as we meet many lovable characters in Wolf Signs.  The only thing that I didn't love while reading this tale was there were a few awkward sayings and I did think that Robyn took things a little ""too in stride"".  But others might not find fault with these issues.  Either way, I still think Wolf Signs and the Granite Lake Wolves Series are worth your while.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"I really, really wanted to like this one.  Unfortunately it was only mediocre for me.  If she called her son ""love"" one more time I was going to strangle her myself.  I have a hard time believing a 13 year old would even tolerate it.  I assume the author is from the UK, which is all fine and dandy, but I'm not and I haven't the faintest idea who the counsil are supposed to be.  The government?  All the talk of elves seemed pointless as was the ""surprise"" about her son.  And why bring Joseph into it?  Bodu was a big disappointment as well.  The ending was predictable, tho well deserved.  Not good, not really bad.  Just there...",0
"From the other reviews I read before buying this novella I thought this was going to be a really hot story.The hero said he was the devil & was going to show the heroine how to be really bad, so I assumed there would be some kink.But I gotta say I've read hotter stories. Yes the bottle was different but there was no spanking, bondage, role play or back door action. Was there even any dirty talk? I don't recall & I only read this book a couple of weeks ago.(not a good sign)If you're looking for a hot read try Enjoying the Show by Marie Harte or if you're after something with a bit of kink (but not hardcore) try Burn List by Julia Devlin both books took me by surprise whereas Carnal Ecstacy I felt like I was waiting for the fireworks that fizzled",0

"I confess that I did not get very far into this story before I deleted it from my Kindle.In this day and age, there is absolutley no excuse whatsoever for bad spelling and atrocious grammar in ANY written work. There is no reason to have a hy-phenated word in the middle of a line...see that example. Things like that annoy me no end(I should have been a proof-reader...I know that I would have done a much, much better job), and to that end, I just pushed the button.Honestly, I think the story could have been good...I wouldn't have bought it otherwise.If I had to give it a mark out of 10? The answer would be a 2. Frankly, I'm embarrassed for the author. Shame!!",0

"I have to say this one has some really hot sex in it, but it's the manner that the sex happens that has me disturbed to say the least.  I am not a fan of force in any manner for sex.  I think that it has to be mutual and I just didn't get the feel that most of this was.Also I like up front honesty in all aspects of the my hot sex and for my money this one was anything but.  I am kind of sorry I already purchased the second book of this series because I don't think I am really going to find it any better than this one, but I'll let you know.I also found the plot in this one flawed, we think she is being kidnapped to save the world and in reality there is a very different reason and it just didn't leave me feeling all that good.I guess this one is really just not my cup of tea, but it might well be yours, so I suggest if you like sci, BDSM, exploitation, force okay for sex you might really like this one.",0
im really not into this type of book .....so i cant give it a good review....other people might like it though,0

"What a yummy fun read!! It kicks things of fairly quickly, wicked little roadside steam!!! This is a very smexy read, loads of steam and variety packed into this short read. I love a hot twin menage!! Oh girl, forget the panties cause you will just have to change them later!Even though the feeling develop quickly I am willing to let it slide, sometimes lust feels like love. And hey this is fantasy, ain't nobody got time to build a relationship!! Still, I felt the liking and the connection between the three.The story is very well written and fast paced. The side mystery is interesting without being overly complicated. For such a quick story I was really drawn in, I even had a sniffle/tearing up moment at the end.I listened to the audiobook and it was a real treat!! Hello smexy voice, Gregory Salinas can read to me anytime!! Seriously call me up and read the phonebook!! He has a delicious growl to his voice that makes a girl swoon. Warning - Do not listen to this at work, you will not be able to concentrate on simple tasks and stout balding co-workers will suddenly look appealing. All the result of one smexy voice and some wickedly hot detailed steam!! He reads with such energy and enthusiasm, that a girl has to pause or embarrass herself in public!!I can only hope Ms Rylon puts more of her books on audio using this delicious narrator who gives multiple eargasms!!",1
"There is nothing better than getting a book by an author whose work I enjoy reading and the book is free (pssssst it's still free until Dec 15 - download it now!).Holiday bound by Beth Kery is exactly what you would expect from her. Don't know what to expect? Well this is not your Mother's romance. Holiday Bound is a short, sexy, sizzling erotic story. This book should have come with a disclaimer. I'm surprised my Itouch didn't instantaneously combust as I was thumbing through the pages. Yowza I was feeling all hot and bothered and it wasn't just because I was working out! I could've used a fan and a tall cool drink of water (ok I did have that close at hand) while reading this E-gniting, erotic E-read.It's Christmas. They're snowbound...no electricity...no way out...no help on the way and only each other to warm the long cold night ahead. Is this a recipe for disaster or a wild fire about to burn out of control? Dear Santa: if you're planning on coming down their chimney - you better watch your boots don't catch on fire.Alex Carradine left the big city and his life as a mover and a shaker in Chicago 4 years ago when he decided to chuck it all and retreat to Holiday Valley to run a ski resort. Alex is sceptical and with good reason when his estranged father Mitch wants to visit for the holidays and bring his latest and greatest main squeeze along for the ride. Maybe hell has frozen over, but Alex is willing to give Daddy Dearest the benefit of the doubt and what better time to try and rebuild their relationship than Christmas....a time for giving.Of all the dumb luck! Alex can't believe the woman he's just rescued from the stranded SUV on his property is Angeline Kastakis...this is his Dad's new girlfriend? Angeline...the woman he fantasized about 4 years ago and hasn't been able to forget? And where is Mitch? What is his father up to now? Is Father Christmas playing a cruel joke on Alex by tempting him and his willpower with Angeline Kastakis? And to top it off...now they're home alone for the holidays.Angeline is conflicted about her feelings for the intense and gorgeous Alex - son of the man she's in a relationship with. She agreed to this little get-away with Mitch so they could explore their relationship and hopefully take it to the next level. But Alex is a force to be reckoned with when he's in full out attack mode...and he's got his sights on Angeline. I might have had a momentary twinge about how easily Angeline caved to Alex's aggressive approach considering she was supposed to be dating his father, but I got over it quickly. Alex is a take charge kinda guy.There is lots of steamy, smexy action including interestingly enough an explicit encounter involving some gym equipment...mmmm...I may never look at that equipment the same way again. It also probably explains why I was breathing a little extra hard.Want to add a little Christmas present to your E-reader? Download Holiday Bound, sit back and enjoy.",1
"At first glance, I wasn't sure how I would rate this book. I couldn't pinpoint why I didn't love it, or what bothered me about it. Something just felt off, unrealistic or unbelievable. I'm still not entirely sure that I can verbalize it. The love the main characters feel for each other is well documented; Cree, Jake and Jenny seem to be made for each other. However, I don't think that love alone would get someone over the trauma that Jenny went through before her guys got her out of the hospital.  She had only one nightmare and needed no counseling? I think one other aspect of this relationship that felt unbelievable was the unquestioned acceptance of their military team buddies.  For a bunch of macho SEALs , these guys just accept Jake and Cree as a couple and accept them in a threesome with Jenny without question. No don't ask, don't tell controversies? Not that I want to promote that kind of attitude, mind you, it is just never an issue. Maybe I'm expecting too much character development in an erotica story.The plot is well written, the characters are interesting if not too complex, and the sex is very hot. The bad guy is a real whack job, and his evil adds tension to the story. The characters get a nice happily ever after. Since the series continues, the other friends get their stories and happily ever afters also, I assume, and since they seemed like really nice guys,  they deserve it.Heat factor hot.",1

"First of all I should mention that I couldn't bring myself to finish this book. I stopped after ca. 40%.I like fantasy, werewolves and vampires, in general. For some reason I just don't seem to be able to like this genre in mm-literature. Especially werewolves, because of the ""mating"". Two guys see each other, and suddenly they're supposed to live and love each other for life. No build-up, nothing.Well, I wanted to give this genre another try. (AndLone, for example, wasn't that bad, after all..).This one, however, is the most boring and unimaginative story that I've read/started in this genre so far.This is, in general, what happens in the beginning:[Be warned, the beginning might be too exciting for some of you. I really don't intend to cause a heart attack or something ...]Laine: ""Hey, you're my mate.""Dev: ""Seems that way.""*Both start having sex.*After that (next morning) the 2 characters make plans for family introducings etc. for the next day.No build-up. No suspense. No tension. Nothing!Well, that's exactly what happens, there are more words in the book of course, but that doesn't really make it more interesting.Whatever happens next (I gave up on it before), it might get a tad more enthralling, but I'm already too fed up with the beginning to really believe that it's going anywhere near ""great"", not to mention ""sublime""..But don't let my opinion scare you away from it.

This author must have an editor and this reader appreciates that.Loved the story and the cute take on the Cinderella story.  The characters were fun, sexy and well developed.

"This short book has absolutely no substance, the characters are totally unlikeable and story, what story.  After the first couple of chapters I just glanced throught it to say I finished it since it was a short story.The whole premise of this book was so interesting and so just in back cover words only....  The heroine did not know her man was a werewolf, and he tells her at their wedding on the day she arrives back in town after not seeing each other for 9 years.  He says Hi we're getting married, ties her up throws her in the car and off they go to get married, and she says ""Where do we stand.""  Ughh!!  This whole thing started with someone sending Amanda flowers in Sebastian's name and that brings them back together after so long, but he didnt send them, and after it was mentioned as the ""plot"" it was never discussed again....",0
"This is a snippet of a story about angels or fairy tale characters (I couldn't really tell what they were or what actual powers they had, other than one of them was an ""empath"") who perform unspecified tasks to fight evil.  The lack of context was a real problem in getting into this story.  I understand that it was meant to be a bridge between books one and two in a series, but maybe a more detailed preface explaining who these people are or what sort of powers they have would help those of us who haven't read the first book.Instead, all we got was a preface explaining that Ren wasn't going to have a happy ending in this story - a rather unnecessary spoiler, I thought.Anyway, Ren is very jealous of his ex-girlfriend or ex-something's happiness (the nature of their relationship wasn't clear - I couldn't tell if they'd been having sex for the last hundred years or if they'd had sex once in a hundred years of unrequited love) so he goes to her house and has a threesome with her and her new boyfriend.  And that is pretty much it.All other action (they fight demons or something?) takes place out of sight.  Weak characters, unnecessary amounts of angst, too much pointless moodiness, and unclear setting make this one that I wouldn't recommend.",0
"Kaylee and her best friend, Emma, chatter excitedly as they peruse the packed mall. Happily, they shop, making plans for the big homecoming dance. Without warning Kaylee begins to tremble and sweat as panic and fear assault her senses. Deep inside she can feel the scream beginning to swell, building and pushing to break free to pierce the air. Desperate, Kaylee gasps for Emma to help her. Quickly, the two girls dash down the corridor and take refuge among the brightly colored, towering stacks of bath towels in a department store. Scared and shaking Kaylee slowly gains control, until the frail, boy in the wheel chair turns the corner. This time she cannot stop the impulse and her shockingly, loud scream reverberates through the air. A wave of tremendous sadness washes over her and tears stream down her cheeks. She falls to her knees unable to cease the deafening wail emanating from her lungs. Clawing at her throat and gasping for air until the fog appears and she falls into blackness. Frightening images flee through her mind and then she wakes to a nightmarish reality. Kaylee is restrained to a bed in a cold, windowless room. Her limbs ache and her voice is raw. Where is she? Kaylee discovers that fifteen hours flew by while she lay shackled and unconscious in the mental institution. Is she crazy? Kaylee navigates around the dire, confines of her new surroundings. Her typical, teenage wardrobe is now sparkly, sweat suits minus the drawstrings ( to prevent hangings) and soft, fuzzy socks. Time is spent, avoiding group therapy sessions and completing crossword and jigsaw puzzles, while her mind plots a way out. A strange girl with mesmerizing green eyes watches her every move. At last Kaylee is on the brink of gaining her freedom when terror rips through her. Again the howling festers and swirls in her throat, threatening to explode out of her, no matter how hard she clamps her jaw. Lydia, the green eyed girl grabs her hand and tugs her down the hall. Inexplicably, Lydia manages to halt the ear splitting howl but at what price? Why is Kaylee unable to control the intense and powerful screams?Rachel Vincent manages to yank you into Kaylee's world with her powerful, short prequel. I was riveted to the story. It is intense to say the least. I swear my jaw ached in sympathy as Kaylee tries to clench back her painful, ear splitting screams (I wonder how her screams compare to those of my three year old daughter on a bad day). Then the horror of waking up in the psych ward. All I can say is Wow!

"Well, I didn't have high expectations for this book and it failed to even reach that low level. I made it about 7 or 8 pages in before giving up in disgust. There is no narrative structure. The speaker (the eponymous ""George"") simply rambles on with no destination in mind. In addition, there is so much foul language it's nearly impossible to decipher exactly what he's trying to say. It's profanity with no purpose other than shock value. Skip this one - it's not worth the storage space.",0
"This is book one of the Pleasure Inn Trilogy.  The Trilogy is about 3 best friends who have worn off men.  The 3 women are not only best friends but also business partners; they own an interior design firm.  Each woman has had her fill of men; Lindsay Bells is tried of the deadbeat men she dates scrounging off of her; Anna Deveau is looking for Prince Charming, but only finding self-serving aholes; Candace Steele is tired of men who used her for daddy's connections and influence.  Their solution...swearing off men - this is where Pamina, the Goddess of Passion, comes into the story.

However, the room she is assigned is too small to accommodate her plans...in steps the sexy-hot handyman, Brad Caldwell.This is an exceptional example of a novella; it set the stage for the entire trilogy without damaging the character development.

"While this book was very interesting at times it was also a bit strange. It will push your boundaries and does deal heavily with erotic pain, it is not your stereotypical BDSM book. It isn't a bad book by any means, just different.",0
"I almost gave up on this book in the beginning, but I'm glad I didn't. It wasn't nearly as good as &#34;captive in the dark&#34; but it had that feel. I wish there was a little more romance/love from Tane at the end. I guess that's not what their relationship is though.",0

"I bought this after I  read the Fey ( which I ENJOYED) . At first I found the characters interesting and it held my interest.I really thought I was going to enjoy the story.  I was mildly surprised to see the cast of  the Fey in this series.  Maybe I should have guesses by the title that it was going to leave me hanging.That's why the low rating.  If you don't mind waiting for the sequel, then it's an OK read.",0
This is not a Christian book. It is new age. Was not what it appears to be. I deleted it from my kindle.,0
"I had high hopes from the blurb - a unique and intriguing premise - and the story started out great. Unfortunately, the initial drama was over much too soon, and suddenly we're thrown forward eight years and the characters have changed completely.If I'm reading a ""reformed rake"" story, I want to SEE ""Lord Wicked"" change over time and EARN his redemption. Telling the reader ""it's eight years later and he's really really sorry"" just doesn't cut it. We miss out completely on the restless, conflicted wickedness and get him tirelessly patient, self-sacrificial and boring.Likewise, I would have been much more likely to have compassion and respect for the heroine if I could have SEEN the consequences of the initial drama. Instead, we leave Jillian as a 17-year-old caught up in the aftermath of a scandalous duel and never really understand what turned her into a rude, self-centered bitch. She refuses to acknowledge her own behavior in the fiasco and blames everyone else around her.I know the author was trying for an ""independent and feisty"" heroine, but Jillian veered off that narrow path straight into ""obnoxious and unlikeable.""A reformed rake needs someone worth reforming for, and Jillian - at least in the first part of the book - definitely isn't it. And Lord Wicked was already reformed by the time he got to her, so what's the point?",0
"I enjoyed this book, it had steamy m/m sex, romance, humor and a little bit of mystery, everything you need in a story to keep you warm on these long winter nights. I liked how the main characters seemed to have completely different personalities and backgrounds yet fit together perfectly. I also like how the author wrote in Ryan's best friend to add some comedic relief so that the story doesn't take itself too seriously. The story draws attention to a couple of very real issues in today's world Autism and the issue of how much is too much when it comes to the media digging into people's personal lives and deals with them well, but not too deeply. I only had a minor problem with the story and that was that at times the characters seemed too perfect so that the story didn't always seem believable. I would recommend this book to any one who likes m/m romance stories, but be warned there is a lot of hot, steamy sex in this book and some of it is explicit, so if you don't like that kind of stuff this not the book for you. This is another good book by T.A. Chase. - Ana",1
"So not worth the money...it was much much too short, before you warm yourself up the book ended.I love the first book, at least that was over 300 pages long (kindle).",0
"I have always loved Cinderella! And this little story only enhanced that love. As it turns out Prince Charming was not Ella's happily ever after, afterall; which is disapointing but he remains Charming none the less. That is what I really liked about this story. It is still a fairy tale, all grown up. If you like Cinderella, then you will like this little twist on the traditional fairy tale.",0
"I read this entire trilogy and the first book I loved, as Venturi and all that nonsense was introduced I just found myself getting more and more annoyed by that subplot. I found it detracted from the story and made me not like Prophecy's character at times. If you truly have met your soul mate and are in love with them, then I don't see how all that other nonsense could be going on, it was just aggravating and I ended up wanting Valentine to rip Venturi's head off and knock Prophecy upside her head. I was glad that it ended in a way that let me feel that she and Venturi would just be friends and her relationship with Valentine would be solid. Then I made the mistake of reading the preview for Spellbound at the end. What!? No way Valentine is okay with that nonsense, just because he accepted that she felt some love for Venturi, and that was even stretching it for me, doesn't mean he'd be okay with that! I guess I loved the first book and then it all slowly went downhill for me because of this. I wish it could have been a stronger relationship between Valentine and Prophecy, because no matter how often prophecy says it's not even a fraction to what I feel for you to Valentine it's still inappropriate to my mind. I'd never believe someone truly loved me if that's how it was.",0
"This is the second book in the Henry Wright series that I have read.

"Emma Carter, co-owner of Wallflowers, has been in love with Max Cannon since grade school and is pretty sure he'll never be interested in her wholesome good looks. Boy, was she wrong. Max overhears her voice while at his friend Simon's and is can't believe that the sexy voice making joking innuendos with his Beta and ordering him around is shy Emma Carter. Determined to discover if Emma lives up to her voice, Max gets Simon to bring him along when he drops off his new masterpiece at Wallflowers.After getting fed up with his ex Livia chasing him all around town, Emma is a breath of fresh air with a delightful sense of humor and oh, yeah, there is just one little thing... she's also his Mate. Max is the Alpha Were-Puma of the local Pride. He breaks it to her quite soon and she takes it with surprising aplomb before he takes her home and promptly divests her of her virginity. Add in best friends who love each other, but won't admit it, ex's who won't give up, and a masquerade where Emma must prove her power as the Curana before the Pride or forever be looked down upon and you have delightful romp of a romance that is just plain fun to read.I really enjoyed this tale by Dana Marie Bell, the characters were interesting and well written for a shorter story and the explanation of the Were-Pumas was short and sweet which I great appreciated because it let the culture have an active part in the romance without making it the milestone to be crossed as it is portrayed in so many paranormal stories. I also greatly enjoyed the detail applied to aspects of the characters personalities (like the photos on the mantle), that say much of a person without having to spell it out for the reader and the humor which left me snorting in my seat (kitty litter? Priceless).",1
"The book was a very short read and it was for the most part decent until the end.(For starters, the story is an interracial read BW/WM )Nila parents insurance runs out which would negate them from being able to stay in a rather expensive retirement home. In order to help make ends meet, she gives up her full time job as a writer to take on a position at one of her friends businesses. The business, Naughty Girls Inc, would provide men would  live-in and paid service for a women without any strings attached. No commitment, no love, just sex.Nila meets Josh, a blind wealthy bachelor, and commits to him with her services ( and his $) until she spots his best friend Richard and find herself falling for him. Nila is then torn between two men who both have become quite fund of her. The decision she makes will no doubt leave two best friends relationship shattered.The plot was good. It's somewhat of a cliche but the author added a bit of twist here and there.However, the end was just pathetically written. I could not believe how the author just ended it after being hit with some interesting information. I understand this was a short read but it should have not taken away from the conclusion which was absolutely one of the worst ending I've read. I cannot be any more disappointed.I would give this book a 2.5 stars if I could. Again, plot was decent but the  ending was bad and I didn't feel any connection with any of the characters.If you're looking for a book that is strictly sexual filled with graphic details, then you might get more out of the book then I did. I was looking for more substance, a back ground story and romance. None of that existed in this book.It was cheap and an easy read so I'm not going to complain too much but Marilyn Lee has written better material then this by a mile. Much better.",0
A good read with a strong character. The ending proved to be a little far-fetched  but definitely a good read!,1
"if i wanted crappy stories and even crappier plots, I would have turned to my local library for the &#34;trash&#34; books they throw away every season!",0
"This story had some very steamy sex scenes, but not very much character development. This could have easily been a much better story with more time spent on the relationship between the main characters. I like a bit more romance with the sex personally, but nonetheless, I enjoyed it and plan to read more by this author.",0
"Ok, so I know the premise was slightly ridiculous. And I know that Lila pretty much prostituted herself out to Hunter to save her father's business but, surprisingly, I really enjoyed this book. It was just a well written story.  Parts that would normally make me roll my eyes somehow didn't.  Even though Hunter is demanding and seemingly merciless to Lila in the beginning, the author does a good job of getting us inside his head so we know he's not just being a jerk for being a jerk's sake.  In a way he was right,  it was a business arrangement and they both knew why she was there.  Lila is no pushover and I found her resolve refreshing without being overbearing.  The sex scenes are HOTTTT, yes, even when Lila can't stand him or so she thinks.  I loved the gradual progression of their friendship and the realization of their feelings.  Loved the scenes with Lila and the dogs, which allowed Hunter to first get a glimpse into his feelings for Lila and I enjoyed their dinner conversations.  When things got comfortable between them, it gave me the warm fuzzies.  I pretty much loved everything about the book. I knocked one star off because I thought that the way that Hunter chose to end their contract was unnecessarily lame and only served to throw in a twist. There was no need for that and it was the only thing that spoiled the book for me.  Of course, they got back together so all's well that ends well.This is definitely a book that I will read  many times over. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1
"Well, this is a short cute story. Linda is dead, Mike is being haunted by her, their neighbors are hiding something, and the poor detective doesn't know where to start. We follow the story to find out why Linda is haunting Mike and making his life a living hell. It's hilarious what all she does to him. By the end, Mike gets his upcoming, the neighbors find peace, and Linda finds her way to the afterlife. It's cute, funny, and you might scratch your head a little at themystery shrouding Linda's body whereabouts. My only drawback is that I think f@#k appears more than the or a does. It was a little excessive that almost all descriptive words were that, but still it was an ok short read that is out of the ordinary in plots.",0
"As an author myself, I sincerely resent tr nowry for causing me to lose valuable writing time - this series is compelling, addictive, unique, technically brilliant and has ruined any chance I have of meeting my own deadline. I MUST read every damned word.Brilliant character development, terrifyingly plausible premise - if you are a fan of any of the classic Sci-Fi writers from the 1930's to the present, you owe it to yourself to read these.Thank you - I have enjoyed every word.",1
"Absolutely the most nasty, scary, gross, violent read in decades.  Loved it!  Fantastic ending.  If you are offended easily then don't read and don't write a negative review...leave it alone.  I really enjoyed it immensely",1
"The book started off okay, but I quickly lost interest in the characters. The writing just meandered along with aimless direction, and when I would put the book down and come back to it later I often forgot who was involved/connected to whom. The ""friendship"" that connects the main characters is very underexplored, and it's more a fairly boring snapshot of three lives wandering in and out of each other's. I wouldn't waste your time.",0
"Annabelle Lee by N.J. WaltersI liked this story.  It started off with Annabelle the librarian, having an erotic dream about the sexy and hot Mike and ended with the dream as a reality.What is it about librarian's that fire the imagination into all kinds of naughty fantasies?  Hmm...",1

"This is the first Hannibal Jones book I've read, and it is a delight on all levels.  The writing is excellent to exquisite.  the characters are believable (including the hero, who can do amazing things, but is still extremely human).  the setting is lovingly and meticulously drawn, in several locales, and the story left me absolutely breathless on more than one occasion.I especially enjoyed some of the side action, for example, the examination of hip hop music ...with which I am absolutely unacquainted, and the insight into lifestyles with which I do not have, and will never have experience.  they added texture and color to this book, without detracting in the least from the story line.  In fact, the author drew all the threads together in a smooth, professional manner that impressed me.Toward the end, I admit to thinking *now* what's going to happen? And something always did, but, surprising and delighting me, what happened was never quite predictable, so I didn't mind what seemed an extended climax.  All in all, this is a wonderful read, and offers more than a little of more than a few things for any reader.",1

"The previous book I read by Mari Carr - ""Covert Lessons"", published by Ellora's Cave - was terrible, so I didn't go into this one with very high expectations. However, this book was put out by a different publisher and therefore had a different editor. I found this book to be a great improvement over ""Covert Lessons"".Gwen Preston has written a popular book of sex-themed short stories called Evening Songs. One of the stories, The Darkest Night, contained scenes of BDSM and Gwen, ashamed of her real-life interest in BDSM because (in part) of a previous relationship that went bad, used a pen name for that story.Ty Ransome is a Hollywood action star who wants to turn over a new leaf and do ""serious"" films. He has read Evening Songs and thinks the book would make a good basis for a movie. He has also discovered that Gwen was the true author of *all* of the stories in the book. This intrigues him because he is secretly a sexual dominant. He offers to purchase the movie rights to the stories with the requirement that Gwen help him write the screenplay.Gwen comes to Hollywood, and Ty puts her up in his guest house. He begins to visit her late every night, after she is in bed, and they talk for hours. Ty makes it clear that he is interested in her in more than a platonic way. Gwen initially keeps him at bay, but he eventually convinces her that he is sincere and also that they should reenact the scenes in her short stories as a way to help them develop the screenplay. Gwen agrees. During the course of this reenactment, Gwen and Ty discover each others secrets - that she is a submissive who craves (some) pain with sex and that he is a dominant who enjoys dishing out what she needs.I liked the chemistry between the main characters and the fact that the relationship didn't start out with sex right away. I do wish that we had gotten to experience a little more of that initial phase of the relationship rather than simply being told that it happened. I also liked that Gwen has a spine. She doesn't immediately cave to Ty's desires, and she's got a few good zippy comebacks for him. Ty is good hero; he is patient when Gwen seems to need it and later forceful in way that doesn't make him seem like an ass.However, this book still suffers from some of the same basic writing problems as ""Covert Lessons"" - avoiding ""said"" as a dialogue tag (my biggest pet peeve); characters inferring the thoughts of other characters and telling the readers that, rather than the author *showing* the reader, occasional bits of stilted dialogue. The flaws are not as prevalent, though, so I don't know if it's result of the different editor, or if the author is improving her craft on her own.I might try another of Ms. Carr's books if the plot sounded interesting and as long as it wasn't from EC.",0
"I thought this book was ok, but nothing to really brag about.  The main characters were a stripper and a hoodlum.....not exactly the types of people I would want to read about when I think of a romance novel.  Aside from that, I did not think that the characters were well developed.  All in all, I had to struggle to finish this book.",0
While the genre he writes in is similar to his father's the writing is definitely his own and very good.,1

"this book is a good read, but not at this price.  I am a very avid reader and have read a lot of books by Bella Andre, however there is no way anyone should pay this price for a paperback with 300 pages.

"The NY Times in Kindle format is great!  The majority of the paper is there each day and it's easy to navigate and read.  The print portion of articles is good, but the quality of the limited number of pictures or other rare graphics could be better.  Sometimes there's an article missing one day; then it pops up in the next day's issue.  That's acceptable to me because I know at some point the day's edition has to be closed and distributed.  What I really like is not having the annoying distraction of ads.  Considering the excellent content, the cost isn't that bad at ~$0.67/day.12/26/2010 update: After two months I've canceled the subscription.  I would subscribe again if the cost was $10/month but at $20/month it is too expensive for a digital edition of the paper.",1

"This was another one of those books that once I started it I sat up until I finished it.  I was so engaged I thought I had read a short story.  The time flew by so quickly.  I felt so sorry for Brian and his younger brother.  The story starts off with such heartbreak when we learn what type of mother they have.  She is the type of person you really want to hate.  You don&#8217;t hear much about the father until later on. This story, although fantasy has so much to teach us.  When Brian finds the amulet he kind of lets the power go to his head.  I have been a fan of the TV show &#8220;Once Upon A Time&#8221;.  Mr. Gold aka Rumplestiltskin has a saying every time someone comes to him for magic.  He reminds them that they need to remember that &#8220;magic comes with a price&#8221;.  It seems that Brian never thought about the price of using the amulet until it was almost too late.  What I didn&#8217;t understand was why his mom waited so long to let him know she knew he had it.  It added another layer of hardness and uncaring to her character.  This story has a redemptive side.  This is an allegorical novel.  It can be read by young and old, Christian and Non-Christian and be enjoyed by all.  I read this as an e-book.  This is a book I most definitely want to get for my classroom.  I even know which student is going to get to check it out first.  This is definitely an author that needs to be recommended more often.  I look forward to reading and reviewing another of his books I have called &#8220;Tycho&#8221;.  Go ahead and check him out.I received a review copy in exchange for my honest review.",1
"Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars).",0
"I have really enjoyed this series. This is the second book in the Rachel Myers series. I am familiar with the setting even though Ms. Jackson slightly changes the names of the towns. I like the way the author tells a story. Each book flows into the next one- so be sure to read them in order. In this book, Rachel's lifelong friend Isaac has her investigate the death of his friend. Isaac knew his friend was afraid of heights and that he would never get that close to the edge of the overlook. So Rachel starts investigating with her logical mind she is soon able to find out what really happened.

"Jane Austen. Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor.  And ""Jane Austen: The Complete Collection"" brings together the full complement of Austen's, from her little-known nonfiction to the classic bestseller ""Pride and Prejudice"" (and everything in between) -- lots of lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories.The collection includes Austen's most famous six novels, which explore love, societal demands, honor and independent thought -- a girl meddling in people's lives, two sisters with completely different romantic approaches, an ""old maid"" whose fiance returns to England, a poor relation whose moral standards are challenges, a hyper-romantic gothic-novel fan whose imagination runs amuck, and a slow-blooming love between a proud man and a prejudiced woman.That's normally where people's acquaintance with Austen ends. But she actually wrote a number of other things -- a brilliantly manipulative widow who seduces, plots and schemes; her ""History of England""; two unfinished novels, ""The Watsons"" and ""Sanditon""; some letters; and some bits of her juvenalia, including some funny early spoofs and her ""scraps.""This collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Her main novels are all love stories, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment), and a biting, sharp-edged wit. But we also see her more openly comedic side (""Love and Freindship,"" a parody she wrote early on).And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen's writing was brilliant -- there's a bit of roughness in ""Lady Susan"" and ""Persuasion,"" but nothing too dramatic. Each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (""The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows""), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (""I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine""). But she also writes some intensely romantic moments as well (""Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you"").Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, naive ones, and mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: quiet, shy older men, sexy clever ones, blunt ones, generous honest ones, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie).""Jane Austen: The Complete Collection"" draws together almost all the work that Jane Austen ever produced, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines. Brilliant, and a must-read for any reader.",1
"Nothing is better than when you start reading a novel and all of a sudden you realize it's so much more than you thought it would be. I began Frank Tuttle's, Dead Man's Rain, and immediately was immersed in a world where the caste systems between the rich and poor were blatantly apparent. I love how Tuttle describes the differences between the two &#34;sides of the track.&#34; One side is dangerous and poverty stricken, while the other has &#34;sweeping lawns and majestic homes.&#34; His descriptions are incredibly visual and you can easily set yourself in the scene. Markhat is a Finder, from the poorer sector. He's a man who &#34;discovers things.&#34; In his worn weary land, he is a man of reason who's seen the best and worst of people.Without giving away too much of the book, he is tasked with helping a rich widow discover why her dead husband is haunting her. There are so many interesting plot elements in this novel and you get sucked in. It's reads well and has a great ending. I'm very excited that this is the first book in a long series. Highly recommend.",1
"GREAT book action and love and naughty bits all rolled into a great writen book, thank you Lauren Dane Thank you",1

I think this story has one of the sweetest HEAs I've ever read.  I did find the relationship believable and appreciate that the author's characters felt like real people - not the over talented billionaire.  The cop was vulnerable and so was the gal and I liked the equal footing in their relationship.,1
"Things are looking up for Caesar Romano. The opening party for the new show at the gallery where he works is looking to be a huge success. With that under his belt, he can quit his low-paying job and apply for a much better paying job at a much more prestigious gallery uptown. The only fly in the ointment is the presence of his former boyfriend Shep, a closeted actor who can&#8217;t seem to stay away. On the plus side, there&#8217;s a hunky though apparently straight detective on the scene who seems more than a little interested in Caesar.The picture isn&#8217;t quite as rosy the next morning, when Caesar arrives at the gallery to find Shep passed out, naked, in the bathroom, and one of the centerpiece busts from the show missing. The stolen artwork is just the tip of the iceberg, as Caesar and his friends are drawn into a web of strange alliances and blackmail. Along the way he finds out that Detective Dan isn&#8217;t what he seems.&#8220;Catch Me If You Can&#8221; is a rather pleasant mystery story. There&#8217;s a bit of screwball comedy to the story line, which could have been played up more. The humor definitely comes through, but doesn&#8217;t quite hit the mark. The same could be said for the mystery itself. It didn&#8217;t quite gel, at least for me. Somewhat curiously, the issue here is that there&#8217;s a little too much going on. That&#8217;s usually not a problem for mysteries, but in this case there are a lot of scenes that actually pull you away from the plot to deliver a political or social commentary, which often buries clues and leads to the mystery.On the plus side, the two main characters have great chemistry together. It&#8217;s not all sweetness and mushy romance; these two have to work a bit to make a real connection. Caesar and Dan are surrounded by a large cast of equally well-drawn characters. The characters alone make this an above average read, and with a tighter plot it would have been even better. I would actually give it 3.5 stars.",0
"Quick read, but nothing special. This collection of essays was not what I would call scary or original. There were no surprises or twists. All of the characters were faceless shells. If you can get this book for a dollar, it's worth it. Otherwise, I would recommend you keep looking.",0
I didn't realize this was a short read so was very disappointed.  The writing was more Hollywood than true crime and I was hugely disappointed.  It gave me something read while waiting for a true crime to be released.  Would not recommend unless you are desperate as I was.,0
"I enjoyed these stories. They were short but had a good story. Just easy reading, and enjoyable. I would recommend these books to anyone. who likes Christian reading.",1
This book for me was okay it was quite stalling at times I really had to force myself to finish it,0
"The Dickens With Love/Josh Lanyon3  Stars.Why I selected this book:  I'd often heard good things about the author, and occasionally saw posts from him on various message boards. [...], I knew the time had come to give this author a shot. What in the dickens choice did I have?James Winter attempts to authenticate a Christmas story allegedly written by Charles Dickens. He is doing this on behalf of a very disgusting man who wishes to remain anonymous because he knows the book's owner, Sedgwick Crisparkle, doesn't want him to have it under any circumstances. James and Sedgwick become lovers, but - as any reader of romance will tell you - secrets threaten to tear them apart.James is a likable character, even though he makes a crack about women buying romance novels. He's down on his luck, but is a decent enough guy. Not without sin, not without mistakes, but a good person. Sedge is also likable, but his character seems a little unpredictable at times, capable of anger and forgiveness in rapid succession.  Perhaps this is the product of being a short piece - there was no time/space for a more nuanced approach. I will say that professorial British types are of the good, and so Sedge is A-Okay with me!This was a pleasant read for me, and no better time to read something with a holiday theme. Mr. Lanyon wove an interesting tale and seems to know his Dickens, giving the story a feeling of believability, even know I know little about that world. I liked that James took a while to give into the romance, acknowledge he was in love, making the happy ending even more rewarding. The conversations between the men were enjoyable. The sex, well, it was okay, but for some reason fell a little flat for me. It didn't seem to matter much since I was so invested in the story and the relationship that I was just glad they had a good time. :)An enjoyable tale for this holiday season -- or the  next one. Like fruitcake, this'll keep for a while if need be. So, if someone from the future -- 2010 or even 11 or 12 -- reads this, I imagine the review will still be valid! ('Cept the movies James references will be out on DVD by then, or Bluray, or whatever you future people are using.)",1
"I was really looking forward to this book as Radin was always my favorite and I couldn't wait for him to return. This was a fantastic conclusion to the series! The raedjour as a people are dying. They've lost so much since their goddess left when Radin was trapped in the void. This finale answered a lot of questions and took the story in a direction I hadn't been anticipating.But first, can I just say, Eyrhaen was a horrible, narcissistic, egotistic BRAT of the highest order. I realize she was the first female raedjour born, EVER, but you'd think her parents could have done a little disciplining at some point in time. She was so horrid for most of the book that even when she started to come around and actually have a conscience I just could never completely warm up to her. Her three closest friends she tortured and treated like pets. That is not a princess in my mind!!Nialdlyn was back and in a somewhat surprising role. Having spent the past more than two decades with the raedjour she is a valuable part of their city and their people. It's absolutely no wonder to me that she and Eryhaen can not stand each other. And, seriously, that was fun to watch!Oh Radin. You've been missed. Without going into spoilers I can not explain what changes he underwent in the void but suffice to say the changes are huge and massively influential.There is so much that I could say but it would all be spoilers. So, trust me that this final book was really good. I had some frustration but mainly over some behaviors, although Radin certainly knew how to knock Eryhaen down a peg or two! So in the end this final book did great justice to the entire series!",1
Grace Livingston Hill always has a great story line. She was a wonderful author. I love the way she brings in the need for faith in  our lives.,1
I actually thought the character was looking for a bad guy.  I was surely wrong.  This was a cute miss guided love story.  I would recommend to a more mature audience considering the love scenes.  The characters were very well described.  I could picture the scenes perfectly.  This was a great book.,1
I enjoyed the story and each of the characters were believable.  I could see the adventures of the characters in developing the story.,0
"Short story that I probably would have enjoyed if it had focused more on suspense and a lot less on senseless acts of violence.  Story wasn't very logical either, like another reviewer stated, it made no sense to me for the park ranger to urge people to go stay in the cabin when the rumblin' started, especially since he knew what the rumblin' brought out in people.",0
haven't used the principles enough to know the value.  I will update this as I use the book more later,1
"This collection overall was well written with fewer typos than some of her other stories. It presented hot and heavy love scenes and leaves the reader satisfied, with the exception of the story ""Beyond Temptation""Brenda's did a great job of presenting the plot and moving the story along however her poor development for Lena's passionate side did little to eliminate Lena's insecurities about her weight.  A quick romp on the kitchen table, lack of foreplay and the failure to utilize a condom or give Lena the option of asking or expecting one left me feeling as though Brenda, not only over looked Lena's true feminine side but lead me to believe that she has the same feelings as Morgan's ex and her desperate cousin Jasmine. She seemed to overlook at times or dispel Lena's feelings about her weight and perhaps even bought into the feeling that there is no way a plus size women should have the right to a man of Morgan's calibur. You would think that after Morgan's pursuit, trickery and lust for Lena that their joining would be earth shattering like that of the passion Brenda vividly bestows upon his brothers throughout each story. However not only did Brenda fail to fully ignite the depths of Lena's passion for Morgan, she failed to bring out Morgan's passion and love for Lena. If a man gets on national television and announces to the world how much he loves a woman, runs the risk of losing his life long dream of become a progressive politician, you would think that he would display that same passion, zeal and respect for the women he put it all on the line for. Brenda denied Morgan if you will (his day, hours in bed with the love of his life)unlike his brothers who were determined to get their leading lady, but were even more determine to make sure she was fully his inside and out of the bedroom.Brenda, may have presented Lena as a Queen Latifah look alike, but her love scenes for the character fell short of giving her the confidence and passion of Queen Latifah. And denied Lena of the earth shattering sexual experience felt by other female characters in this series.All of the men throughout this series ""Forged of Steele"" are refined, well manner, passionate outside of the bedroom, but when they get behind closed doors they become hungry almost animal like for the women they want and love. Morgan's character however only fits this description outside of the bedroom leaving the reading feeling disappointed and cheated in the end.....",1
"If you are into werewolves then this one is for you! Keith and Abby's story is one that had to be told. This story does build a strong Alpha male into someone I would want for myself, but left me a tad disappointed with the Alpha female. Her struggles to be as strong as she should didn't ruin the overall effect of the story line, yet having read the entire series I was glad to see that Moira Roger's wasn't done with this female character. I truly enjoyed this and would recommend this one as definite summer reading!",1
"I loved this book, it was realistic in a fictional way and I can't wait to read more from this author.",1
"I enjoyed reading this complete series of Wizard of OZ. Some books I had read before, but this is the first time I am able to read a complete set of books in order. Some books are new to me. I am currently reading this complete set.",1

"wow i must say that the delver really got under my skin.  i was really kinda hoping he or Linda would end up dying.  He is the most conflicted character i have ever met.  He pretty much says out of sight out of mind. he wont permit killing an evil beast but wont follow it to prevent it from killing anyone, its ok as long as he doesnt see.",1
This is the kind of story that has you rooting for the underdog. Imagine being in love with a man whom you know loves you too but refuses to give into his desires because of what he is... This is a great story of how love conquers all.,1
The length of the story is part of the problem. Characters and plot didn't have time to fully develop. I did not like the premise that the two main characters were forced to marry because their brothers planned the wedding without telling the fated couple that they were the bride and groom.,0
"This was my introduction to this author.  It is a quick read and I was impressed - it peaked my interest in the series.  I am not going to summarize the story because everyone has already done an excellent job of that.This was worth the download; I would have even bought it had the first in the series been the free one.  Just to continue the series - quick - easy reads.  I am starting on the third,Heat of the Storm: An Out of Uniform Story.now.These are the books in the series -Heat of the Moment: A Red-Hot Summer story.-  Seems to come before this book - since it is the story of Shelby Harper and John Garrett.  Also it appears to introduce Carson Scott.  He is a third for this couple.  I would have liked to of read this one first but, it wasn't the free one.Heat of Passion: An Out of Uniform story.Heat of the Storm: An Out of Uniform Story.-  This is Lieutenant Will Charleston story - he is introduced in Heat of Passion.  I am very interested in reading his story.  I like stories where the couple start off as friend, wanting more.",0
This one is indeed a rare gem even though I have seen similar plots before.  That in no way takes away the gem quality of the story that is told.Two people who are in some way without love or means to achieve their best are brought together by need.  She for money for her brothers education he for loss of half his face in a brutal war.Together they find that all things are possible.  That love does not know lost beauty nor lost fortune.  Love know no boundaries and can both heal and abound wherever it finds fertile ground.This is a love story for all time and one that you really should read and enjoy.  Diane Gaston at her best.,1
"An interesting story, with predictable major events, and atrocious editing!  Editing needs in part are due to poor, amateurish writing;  some conversations and statements are so corney that I laughed out loud!!  However, the story was good enough to keep me reading until the end of this part (book1).  I have not decided whether to purchase the second book in the series; it has to be written better than this one!",0
I have to confess that I was ready to breeze through this book and pass it off. But then I was teary eyed and I realized it was really tugging at my heart. The characters start off a bit predictable but I loved them as the story evolved. This story is a mix of It's Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol. This sweet story warms the heart and will charm even the biggest Scrooge. I read this at the beginning of summer and it was still refreshing. Romance knows no season! I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to review it.,1
"I liked that this book had a few new ideas compared to similar books.  However, it wasn't different enough to be really special and I think there are several other books in this genre that are better (Stardancer, Vexing Voss, Virile, Ninth Orb).  The author definitely has potential though",1
"First off, I would like to point out that there are a lot of things to love about this book. Although the premise has been visited by other authors in some shape or form previously, I felt this author did a good job of twisting his own tale when he wrote this book. I liked the main character well enough and could understand early in the story where the author was going, without being able to guess the ending. I never felt during reading this book like I was lost or that the book stopped making sense. I did wish to see a little more vibrant descriptions at times, which I thought would have taken the book from ordinary to extraordinary.I found this author had a unique storytelling ability and I was curious enough to see where he was headed with this book, so I managed to finish it up quickly and I was satisfied with the ending. I was impressed that the end of this book didn't feel rushed or too abrupt, as I hate when that happens.What made me decide to leave this book a four star rather than a five, was the errors. There are a lot of them and some of them are truly egregious. These are all things that a good proofreader could have caught before this book was published. The author used the wrong form of a word for example ""The sound of footfalls scrapping across the cavern floor"" or missed a word completely making me go back and read the sentence again and again until it made sense, or used the wrong verb tense. If these issues were fixed, I think with a couple of minor rewrites, this book might deserve a full five stars. As it was, it was a unique and entertaining read that needed a bit of polishing.****Further comments and adjustment of stars****After speaking with this very pleasant author, I have discovered that the version I downloaded a while back has since been edited again, removing the errors that were previously stated in my original review. I would like to now give this book the other star it deserves. I love when an author is concerned enough about the quality of their work that they will actively try to improve it once the book has already been published. Great book worthy of a read.",1
"This is just like the title says, a list of tips for traveling...in some cases with your vampire. Some are common sense for normal traveling because things like ""don't drink the water"" rarely have anything to do with the immortal undead. There are some points in this that made me smile though and there were some valid points as well when it comes to vampires. There are also a few jokes thrown in that are a bit funny. Though overall it was kind of a dull and quick read. It seems to be tied in with the author's series, which I have not read, even though it doesn't really mention this.",0
This is the second book in a series about a PI named Doan and his great dane Carstairs. The story is fun and a joy to read.,0
I am not sure if I like the fallen angel idea for romance so the jury is still out on that one.  If this snippet was designed to get me interested enough to purchase the book ... it did not.  I never learned to share some things well so the double bro-mance is definately off my list things to read. (ICK!),0
Unique and delightful characters abound.  I found the sisters to be particularly funny in a somewhat sneaky kind of way.  Laughter would erupt almost before I knew it!  Most enjoyable.,1
"The most important question I have when looking at the mix of reviews for this Kindle freebie is this: Did we all read the same book?? It's good for everyone to have their own opinion, but facts are facts, and classifying this as an all-sex-no-plot book is quite inaccurate. The first sex scene doesn't even occur until the 50% mark (on Kindle) and there are only three sex scenes that are described at all, one of which is mostly glossed over. It bothers me when a book is trashed by reviews that incorrectly represent the published material. Is Forbidden: The Sacrifice perfect? No. In my opinion it's quite good (I'll clarify in a moment), but in no way - and this is not opinion - is it a sex-filled smut book with no plot.At thirty-five, Doctor Wesley Atherton is a successful psychiatrist living and working a comfortable, steady life in London. Katherine is a twenty-four year old American who is staying with a family friend in London during her fashion internship when Wes, rather literally, first bumps into her on the Tube. Practical to the point of having been mortally embarrassed by his bohemian parents, Wes had never believed in love at first sight (or second or third sight, actually). He had, however, always firmly believed in recognizing what he wanted in life and working to get it, so when he gets his first glimpse of Katherine's beautiful green eyes and sees that almost precocious smile, Wes does everything humanly possible to convince her that sharing a life with him is what she needs to do - and even though Katherine is engaged to another, Wes is determined to woo her.One evening, following an outing that Wes certainly considers a date, even if Katherine doesn't, their Tube ride comes to a crashing, deadly end, and Wes and Katherine are thrust into Death's awareness - and he's none too happy to have a victim escape his clutches. With the help of a psychic, a spy, and a butler, Wes and Katherine have to embrace a world far more complex and dangerous than they'd previously believed, and hope that the bonds of love that are so new but so deep between them will be enough to save them all.Forbidden: The Sacrifice is actually a nifty little story with a quirky cast of characters and a plot that moves along nicely, once it starts moving. I was totally enamored with Wes and thought he made an excellent protagonist. It's actually been awhile since I've read a book I'd classify as paranormal romance-ish with a male lead and told in first person POV, so if he hadn't been so appealing, amusing, witty, and self-deprecating, this book really could've gone bad for me fast. Fortunately, he was all those things, as well as determined, intelligent, charming, and very much committed to his Katherine. I liked him very much.Unfortunately, and as is often the case with first person POV, the rest of the characters weren't fleshed out as well as they could have been, though I don't really have any major complaints about the level of development in the secondary characters Jennifer, Will, and Charles. The POV just makes it too hard to develop secondary characters fully. At least the history between Wes and Charles and the professional relationship between Wes and Jennifer helped define and flesh out their characters enough to work in the story (Charles in particular). The only real complaint I had with character development was, unfortunately, Katherine. As the female lead, I would've liked to have seen quite a bit more development and dimension given to her personality and what was there was not always appealing. She was a bit too wishy-washy for me - insecure, afraid, and doubting one minute, determined, strong, and certain the next, with no clear rhyme or reason in the vacillation, and she was never written as a fight-by-his-side sort of female. She was pushed into rooms and hidden behind doors. Protected. I can understand Wes' need to do that, but I'm a bit too much of a feminist to accept Katherine's willingness to allow it. That IS personal opinion and preference, though, and others may not feel the same.I liked the plot and I loved that it was centered in London. I had a few issues with the pacing, though, and a minor complaint about the opening chapters. The story starts with an out of sequence event, the Tube crash, and because of the nature of the crash, the narrative (Wes' perspective) is disjointed and choppy - confused and wounded. While it's completely understandable that it would be that way given what's just happened to him and to Katherine, because we don't know either of them yet, it's a little jarring and takes a bit of perseverance to wade through with any sense of feeling for these characters we've just met. I wish the story had been told in a more linear fashion starting with the meeting of the lead characters, so that when the crash occurred, we had a baseline understanding of Wes in particular and some empathy for his fear about Katherine's plight.Perseverance, however, does pay off in this instance, and once the story pushes beyond the crash the plot really starts to zing along and Wes turns out to be vastly entertaining as he tells his story. The paranormal aspects of the book are slowly added until the intensity and danger reaches a tense fruition. Again, I have another personal opinion/preference. I wish those paranormal aspects had started to sneak in a bit sooner and built a bit faster. I don't think the plot was slow, but I do think that the pacing could've been improved by spending less time with Wes being oblivious and doubtful of the mounting paranormal events around him and more time on the climax to the story, which I personally thought felt a wee bit rushed and a bit confusing for that rush. As a result, I thought the climax was a little less powerful and lacked the impact it could've had, given the gravity of the thing.Circling back around to the sex topic, I feel the need to elucidate my opinion. While the sex scenes weren't overabundant in this book, I will admit, the sex is described graphically. Wes uses adult language and isn't real into flowery euphemisms. In fact, he uses colorful, sometimes coarse language all through the book, and while most is British slang, if you're up on the slang from across the pond, you'll know just how colorful and coarse it is. In my opinion, however - and this is very important to me - the sex scenes develop as a natural, healthy progression of the emotional situation the characters are in at the time, as opposed to gratuitous sex for no other reason than to titillate readers. Hey, I'm all for a bit of fun titillation, but I like to leave the gratuitous kind for when I'm in the mood for erotica romance. This isn't that. I found the sex to be neither overly explicit nor overdone. Take that as you will, as I admit I prefer the sex scenes in my books to be as adult and freely passionate as I prefer sex to be.For a free read, this book is far more than I expected. Considering some of the other ratings and reviews, it's WAY better than I'd hoped. As the start of a paranormal romance series, it definitely has potential and has insured that I will be actually paying for the second book in the series. This was the first book I'd read by Samantha Sommersby. It won't be the last.",1

The writing is excellent the characters are described with a depth few authors are able to describe characters  with. For some reason in this three part series starting with Rance in ""McKettrick's Pride"", Jesse in ""McKettrick's luck and finally Keegan in ""McKettrick's Heart""' Keegan's character grips your heart, his pain becomes your pain and when joy finally finds him it becomes your joy.

"Book 1 ""Heroes of Silver Springs"". Followed byTwin Games.Plot:Veronica has returned to Silver Springs to begin living her life her way. And what she wants is a taste of Dean. Only Dean isn't the Bad Boy she remembers, and when she finally realises what he's looking for, it's too late to back off from the HEA. This one's A Keeper.Comments:- Contemporary Firefighter SmallTown erotic romance.- 2807 kindle locations, 41,000 words- m/f - explicit, varied. Includes near-exhibition (in not-quite-private locations). Some pain with the pleasure (heading towards too forceful for the situation).- Veronica is a widow; her husband was a cop who died in the line of duty. She's also always been The Rich Girl and off-limits to someone like Dean. Now she's looking to sow those oats she had to keep hidden. Dean, however, wants a girl he can make a forever with.- My e-version had a number of proofreading issues. Enough to detract from the story, and wish the author had given just a little more attention to details.Opinion:One aggressive woman, one wary male - she wants a f**buddy, he wants a HEA. It's an interesting, different read, but in the end there just really isn't anything *special* about it. It's a nice enough read, and an interesting start to a series, but nothing overly remarkable. On the plus side, Dean being a firefighter is integral to the story. Unlike many books of the genre who claim ""Real Heroes"" as their Leading Man, the firefighting aspects actually *matter* and Dean really is a Hero. That's nice. But it isn't one I'd put at the top of my recommendation list. It's just okay.3.5 stars rounded down. It just doesn't have the ""wow"" factor.-CR-",0

I am really glad I picked up this book recently. I am also happily surprised by the story and the characters. I love the dragons and wish there were more books out there like this.My only issue is when they are riding and then it says they led them somewhere. Wait........weren't they riding??? I don't lead my horses unless I am on the ground in front of them. It always makes me stop and reread the line or paragraph to make sure they were riding. Maybe this is something I haven't heard of before?Other than that it is a really good story and I am looking forward to reading more.,1
"I like David and Jeremy from the earlier books in the series, namely Hidden Force and A Helping Hand. I am glad the abused David gets his HEA and there could not be a better choice than Jeremy to help this tormented man to heal. But close to 58% of the story is sex which is just too much for me. How do I count this. If you read it using Kindle it is easy especially when the first sex scene stops at 33% of the book. So while the sex is well written it is just too much. And why does a guy has to finally top or bottom, when he is reluctant initially, just to prove he is finally ready to take the plunge in a gay relationship. I like the plot, which is like an extension of the story in Hidden Force, and the guys. But this one just has too much sex even if well written.Hidden Force is still the best in the series.",1
"This story could have been so much more - great characters, good plot but it was so short to allow for character development so the believability was very thin. Nevertheless, still a good read for the $2.66 price tag",0
"This one was everything that Brazen should have been! Men can be so stubborn so you gotta hand it to Nikki for going after what she wants! Both she and J.T. were very likable characters. Reckless is what I would call a fluff piece. Its a fun, quick, easy read that doesn't require you to think too much. It is one of those books that are purely for entertainment only. That's great because sometimes you just need to relax and have a little fun.",1
"My title says it all.  The heroine gets into one outrageous situation after another, and the main male character gets conked unconscious time after time yet miraculously suffers no brain damage.  It was all just too much.  I ended up skipping through page after page just to get finished, not that I cared about how it ended, just can't seem to leave a book unfinished once I've started reading it.",0
"I have read a ton on WWII and the Nazi occupation of countries. There are some saying fiction because of incorrect information about the Pope helping or not helping the Jews during WWII. You can find information to document both sides of that coin in other books. Don't get so caught up on what others are saying regarding that issue. Just enjoy a really engrossing and compelling read that I find to be accurate. I rarely give 5 stars, but this is a can't put down book.",1
Good story as it unfolded. I had some frustrations with some gaps in the writing. I liked Kendall's dialogue & looked forward to his sarcasm remarks. Overall 3.5 stars.,0
"Marion Stein's Loisaida - A New York Story was one of my favourite novels of last year - The Death Trip is a novella and a very different beast to it's predecessor.The Death Trip is a more tightly focussed story than the cast-of-thousands Loisaida and unlike that book's unflinching realism and period detail (being set in the 80s Lower East Side) it introduces an sci-fi almost metaphoric element - the titular Death Trip. This is a new drug that is used to ease the suffering of terminally ill patients - by taking it they enter an unconscious state that feels like years spent living in their own version of paradise, but in fact takes place in minutes before the person dies.The central character is investigating the drug and the corporation that manufacturers and administers it, and Stein uses the drugs existence as a starting point to throw lots of ideas it the mix.  And this is very much a novel of ideas, and if the thought of characters debating ethics and ideas puts you off a book then this isn't for you (although there's plenty of intrigue, spot on characterisation, and even some romance too). Stein creates a pleasant moral ambiguity around proceedings - the question of whether The Death Trip drug really is a miracle or something sinister is left tantalisingly unclear. As such this is a book that requires some intellectual investment from the reader - I was reading this whilst the Tony Nicklinson right to die debate was in the press, and that very much coloured my response.Fortunately whilst it might be up in the air about whether The Death Trip drug is good or bad, there's no such debate needed about whether The Death Trip book is good or not - it's another great read. And it's free - what more do you need?",1
"Kill The Storyis a very good mystery. Plot was highly original and will appeal especially to those who disapprove of the invasiveness of reporters (though the revenge in this case is harsher than deserved). Pacing was good, and kept me reading. Progress of the investigation was credible. Characters were interesting and intelligent. Ending is a nail-biter and highly satisfying.Two negatives in my opinion: some gratuitous cursing; also I've read mysteries that are slightly more uniformly gripping, though I'd put this one in the top quartile for ""grippingness"".Very entertaining. At $2 it was a great deal, too. I highly recommend it.",1
"another genius bad guy. A protaganist, who isn't a genius or original. Way beyond believable. You can skim this. It won't take long. The last twist just caused a groan. Save your time.",0
"This book has a good beginning and a great ending. The middle was like trying to swim in molasses. This is usually my type of story, but this one missed out on many key elements. While the many good guys/gals were well developed, the author never bothered making the bad guys real. They were bad but it was sort of so what.I will read book two in the series but if it fails to hold my interest, I will not be reading the rest of the series.",0
"Very short story of a woman whose healing capabilities kills her on her last mission and a man belonging to race(which i believe are centaurs no proper description was given more than they had a 4 legs of a horse and how they refer to kids) rather feared whose purpose is to keep her from her mission.Basically little plot, a useless hero that no one understands and at very end he tries to make her stay by confessing?? WTF you've been on her case the whole time without even any hint of caring on you suddenly spring it on her at the VERY END of the book.....geez the most enjoyable thing was the women being strong willed enough to keep to her death mission. At least the end can give you some silver of hope she lived",0
"I am slightly disappointed by the quotations in this book. While the quotations are familiar, they are mostly Bible quotes. I had expected that this book would contain more quotes from famous individuals. All that aside, it is still a good read.",0
"Hayden Houston is visiting Chicago where her father owns the Chicago Warriors hockey team. Hayden is a junior art history professor at Berkley. Hockey is not something that Hayden likes very much, it has taken the attention of her father away from her. Ever since he became the Warriors owner they have drifted apart, Presley Hayden has less time for his daughter. To make matters worse her boyfriend Doug, wants to take things slow, too slow for Hayden. So they are on a break. Her friend Darcey suggests that Hayden should pick up a guy from the bar and take him back to her hotel for a night of hot sex. This is not something that Hayden has ever done, but on a dare from Darcey she approaches a hot guy playing billiards. Brody Croft is immediately taken with the sexy brunette with green eyes, who challenges him to a game of billiards. He is even more surprised when she invites him back to her hotel suite.Brody wants more than one night with Hayden, but she is determined that one night is all he is getting. But Brody is used to getting his own way. What Hayden dosent know is that Brody is one of the star players on her father's team, and a hockey player is the last person Hayden would want to get involved with.First read by this author, and what a pleasant surprise this was. A hot and sexy read, with likeable characters. Plus a good story, there is suspicion of players on the team being bribed. Her father is getting divorced from his wife who happens to be only two years older than Hayden. With all the trouble surrounding the team, can Brody and Hayden really make things work between them.A very good read recommended.",1
"While the author does give some new tips on finding books, but most of the information is readily available. This ebook may be good for the person who just got a Kindle, but for most users stick to the way you find your books that you would like to read -- bestseller lists, NY Times, recommendations from friends, or just browsing books until you find one that seems to be interesting.",0
"From the book summary I really thought I was going to enjoy this story a lot, but sadly, I didn't enjoy it at all. The plot is full of holes and rife with inconsistencies, the story bored me to tears and it's clear from the vast amounts of grammar errors that this was a first draft which wasn't revised. I really, really wanted to enjoy this story, but from start to end I just couldn't get into it, and there were few to no explanations for most of the characters' motivations. Too much telling and too little showing, too much narrative and no character development - the list is endless. In my opinion the idea for this book has lots of potential and with the guidance of a professional editor, it can easily become a bestseller. Unfortunately, I won't be reading the rest of this series.",0
"Another good book in the Henry Wright series--I read all of them and they were all good.  If you like police dramas, I think you would enjoy these books.  Henry Wright is a hard working officer, has had better days, but with his way of thinking how criminals might think, he has a head start on getting the bad guys.",1
"The author seems to feel that if it can be said once, it needs to be said five times. the characters talk about what they want to do over and over. the author tells you who the ""bad"" guy is. The characters are 2 dimension.  no surprises in  this book.  could not get past the half way mark in reading it. deleting it as soon as I can",0
"Interesting for the historic value- not really a story, rather an accounting of the events. Interesting biographical  information in the 1st person.",0
"As other reviewers have said it is fairly far into the novel before the murder is even mentioned.  The first 20 % is all character development.  And going over and over about how the protagonist is skinny with no curves and her sister is a curvaceous beauty.  over and over and over to the point where I'm wondering if the author has some issues with this.This is one of those books where you start to say, ""what point are you trying to make?""  The writing is smooth and the dialogue okay but I won't be getting the rest in the series.",0
"I don't mond reading bad language when there is a purpose for it, however this book has it just to use it without real purpose. I understand that it is the language of the character, but every other word is excessive. I would not listen to a person that spoke that way so I deffinately would not read it. I had an english professor once say, &#34;bad language is used when you haven't the vocabulary to use other words to express yourself.&#34; I also found the dialogue unbelievable. I can see what he author was trying to accomplish with the inner monologue as well as verbal daiologue, but it failed. I couldn't recommend this book to anyone.",0
"After being dumped by Billy Buchanan at her prom, Eden LaCroix has grown up and moved on.  Ten years is a long time to be hung up on someone.  But when Billy comes back into her life, Eden thinks that maybe a quick fling will finally get him out of her system.  Having her friend-with-benefits, Jon White Feather, show up only complicates the matter.Billy's escape on prom night is a mistake he's lived with for the last ten years.  Can he finally let himself fall in love?  Will Eden let love slip through her fingers again?Wicked Garden is a must-read for m&eacute;nage story fans.  So many issues got in the way of Eden and Billy, but now things are different for them.  I truly enjoyed their chemistry.  I could relate to the old feelings that kept coming up.  This is a wonderful ""second chance"" story.  And who doesn't want one of those?  The threesome steam up the sheets and the pages - you won't want to put it down.  Lorelei James hits another home run with Wicked Garden, and that's why I am Joyfully Recommending Wicked Garden.VivianReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
This book was so unbelievably ridiculous. It's like the author went to her absolute extreme to make this book as far from reality as possible. I only finished it because I was curious in knowing where the heck she was going with this story. Even though this book was free I still feel cheated. I can never get back the precious time I wasted and you won't ether.,0
Not a good read at all. The story line was horrible and just went everywhere. Made completely no sense and in a great need of editing. She offends all of her friends and trys everything to get her ex-boyfriend back who also slept with her 12 year old sister and got her pregnant. Say What!!!! Then magically at the end her drunk of a mom finally gets her book that she has been working on published for I guess a large amount of money. The whole thing mad no logical sense. Save yourself don't read.,0
"Pleasant reading but not much of a mystery. Central characters well-drawn but the action defied credibility. The resolution of the multiple dilemmas and crimes makes little sense, with the fate of the various characters having little logical connection to their prior activities. With a well-structured, logically coherent outline and some respect for reality, the author could do quite well with the next one. At a reasonable  price, this one will pass muster as a light tale about middle aged women and their difficulty in achieving a modest degree of equilibrium in their relationships.",0
"This was a very good story that was very hard to put down.  Using the Baen criteria for science fiction, I found the technology, characters, and situation believable.  I got the Kindle version of this book for under a buck, and I received a heck of a lot more value than a dollar.  The ending left a lot to be desired - it was as if the author suddenly decided he was done and quickly wound it up - it left me and others hanging wanting more: more of a conclusion of what happens to everyone, should we believe there will be a sequel, etc.?I took away one star as this book is in serious need of a proofer / editor.  Many times with the Kindle version there were missing words, incorrect spelling / syntax of words among a few problems.  That's annoying in a novel (and anywhere else) and makes you stop and lose your concentration.",0
"This was a really great, fun-to-read story.  This author puts emotions into words perfectly.  There was steamy sex, a groveling husband, a happy wife.  Loved it.Quinn McKay and Libby were in a wife-induced trial separation.  They'd been having too many problems, one of them being the fact that they couldn't get pregnant.  But the separation was killing Quinn - he'd always been the strong, silent type, figuring that's what he should be.  A talk with his brother Ben made him think back - and he made a decision.  Changes that had come over the years they'd been together were possibly what the problem was?  Well, when he finally got together with Libby and let her see how he really felt - and she did the same - their life together changed quite a bit.  Excellent read.",1
"I like dragons, and this was a free download, so I gave it a try. Aside from needing editing (or at least some proofreading) to clear up the clunky storytelling, I found myself disappointed. The story starts slow, works up unevenly to a burst of action... only to end not with a conclusion, but with an out-of-the-blue jump into the premise of the Dragonseer Saga series. That was halfway through the download: the other half turned out to be a preview of the first full-length Dragoneers book. Even knowing that it was a prequel, even knowing that it was a novella, I'd hoped for a more complete, self-contained tale, not what amounted to an overlong Prologue. I didn't bother with the preview; if this novella is an accurate indicator of the author's style and sense of story, I already know the Dragonseer Saga won't be on my reading list anytime soon.",0
This book really skipped around. No high and low points and no big drama in the story. I have never been so incredibly bored,0
"I read the entire ""book"" which is the only reason I didn't give it one star.  Apparently this prequel to other Rachel Vincent books in this same genre is supposed to explain some of the backstory and entice the reader to want to read more.  If so, it does a terrible job because nothing is really explained and I had zero desire to read any further in this storyline.I disliked the teen girl protagonist's attitude throughout the short book, although I think she was a reasonably accurate picture of the extreme egocentricity, wild mood swings, annoying sarcasm, and lack of rational thought exhibited by many teenagers today.  I'm the father of two female teens so I've got quite a bit of experience with them.  She may have been accurately portrayed but she wasn't sympathetically portrayed and as a result I could not care less what happened to her.",0
"He had an english accent which he seemed trying to hide. I don't know this, but my impression is that europeons now own the WSJ.England s a great country, but I'm suspicious of europeon socialism. (I really can't spell it.) In particular the Brits are proud of their writing ability, and rightly so, but I'd rather have Americans brainwashing Americans, bad as that may be.",0
"The elf child does something wrong and instead of owning up to it, runs away, and hides in what turns out to be Santa's sack. The elf 'redeems' himself by saving Santa from a snowman with a karate kick to the snow man.  The disobeying and then running away plot is overused in a lot of self-published children's books.  The whole first part of the story about the toys being manufactured factory-style instead of hand-made by elves was dull to my grandkids.  Hard to get  them to make it to the end of the story.  I thought the karate kick to the snow man was ridiculous but it was funny to them and actually the only part of the book they responded to.",0
"""Serial"" is a great little collaborative effort by two entertaining writers.  Chapter one shows the grandfatherly-looking serial killer known simply as ""Donaldson"" torture and kill a hapless hitchhiker that he picks up at a rest stop.  Chapter two shows a woman serial killer named Lucy torture and kill two guys who picked HER up hitchhiking.  Chapter three is serial killer Donaldson giving a ride to serial killer Lucy, and the fun begins.The story is graphic and visceral and not for the squeamish, but don't worry- it's not torture porn.  Jack Kilborn (who's really thriller writer J.A. Konrath) and Blake Crouch are pros who know how to tell a story, not talentless hacks just describing an ax falling and hacking off limbs (not that there are scenes as unimaginative as a simple ax attack here).  Yes, you will graphically be told what implement, say, Donaldson decides to use against his victim, and, yes, you are clearly told what Donaldson does with the implement.  But the facts are related quickly, without excruciating detail.  The rest is all in the reader's head.  Kilborn and Crouch give us what our neurons need to know to get started, and sit back and let us fill in the rest.  That's why it's such a hoot to read some of these other Amazon reviews that complain about the ""too graphic"" nature of ""Serial"".  In the end, these nastily clever guys realize that good horror writing- even graphic horror- ultimately comes from a formula of one part writer and three parts reader.""Serial"" is about the length of a longish story in ""Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine"", and- truth be told- could probably appear there with only a little re-writing to tone it down from its current Hard-R or NC-17 tone.  After all, most of the story consists of interesting character exchanges (lots of dark-tinged banter, especially), moments of clever set-up, and plenty of good suspense... all things that have to do with decent writing and not graphic bloodletting.After the story's over, ""Serial"" is rounded out by a fun, illuminating  chat between the two authors and moody, entertaining excerpts from two of their books, making the whole package good for an hour or two of edgy entertainment on the couch or porch. Even if ""Serial"" goes up to a buck or so from its current bargain price of ""free"", this would still be a worthwhile download for your Kindle.",1
Loved the story. Hope to read some ore.i recommend to those who like previous read books to read this also.,1
"I read a lot of romance novels - I've read a lot of bad romance novels, but I usually finish whatever I am reading.  This book was so tiresome and boring that I started randomly skipping pages around the middle of the book. For whatever reason, I wanted some sort of resolution so I skimmed my way to the end.  But what a tiresome read....I thought Roxy was ridiculous and over the top.  Reading the constant descriptions of her clothing and how over the top it was, made me wonder why she didn't call in Dolly Parton to model for her.  I didn't like Roxy, her mother or Zayne's mother.  Zayne was tolerable but really?  A modern day tomoato farmer living 10 minutes from Nashville?  I had a hard time accepting any of this book....",0
A short and fast read.The story is just as good as all the others in the series.I do feel to book length vs cost is disproportionate.,0
First time reading a book about a person who can shift into more than one animal.  A good read not the best but it kept my interest the whole time,1
"The Autry Team are my kinda guys, they all got screwed by the Pentagon types but there is one in Washington that knows and respects the capability of the Helicopter and Autry's team of Mungo and McCane + the rest, CIA agent Gary Weir.

"This is worth the money for another version of your Bible. It reads somewhere in between the NKJV and the KJV, but closer the the KJV. It's definetely worth adding to your array of literature in you Kindle collection. Amazon has made the price affordable for a concise publication of the &#34;Word of God&#34;. You won't be disappointed. Oh and yes, Genesis is literal. Study and find out, It's time you knew the truth.",1
"At twenty-seven years of age, rodeo and film heartthrob Levi McKenna has his eyes set leaving on Las Vegas a champion.  He's let fame sideline him for a while but now he's back on track and determined that nothing will prevent him from achieving his goals - and since he's single there isn't even a woman to distract him.Sydney Hart is the little sister of his good friend Dusty and she's part owner of a Las Vegas bar called Cowboy Up.  Of course Levi doesn't know that before stepping foot in the bar and witnessing her rendition of Kelley Pickler's `One of the Guys.'  He's always thought she was beautiful but watching other men drool over her inflames all his possessive instincts.  He made a promise to Dusty years ago that he'd never touch Sydney - but some promises are meant to be broken.Sydney has lousy taste in men and never has any trouble attracting jerks.  Her last boyfriend is still obsessively watching her so she's not in any big hurry to hook up with another man who'll make her life a living hell.  Of course she knows enough about Levi to trust him to not be psychotic and there's definitely a sexual attraction that's impossible to resist.At first Sydney and Levi keep their relationship strictly on a friendship level but as time progresses and they spend more and more time together the attraction proves to be too much and one kiss quickly leads to other far more intimate moments.Levi has quite a reputation with the ladies and he isn't interested in soiling his relationship with Sydney by allowing the press to get wind of it.  Levi and Sydney's romance is as wild as their Texas hearts unleashed on a Las Vegas strip but can they withstand an angry brother and an obsessive ex?BUCKLING DOWN is a red hot scorching romance which is as hot as Texas - and as wild as Las Vegas.  Moira Keith installs plenty of humor, passion, emotion and non-stop action in this captivating tale.  Rodeo cowboys give women lots of moments of intense joy just watching the way they move so you can just imagine how exciting Levi is to any woman who comes in contact with him.  Sydney's got a spirit that matches Levi perfectly and keeps him coming back for more.  BUCKLING DOWN is a perfect addition to the WILD RIDE anthology.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
"First of all: I love Josh Lanyon, what can I say, he's one awesome writer. So far I haven't read anything else by Laura Baumbach, so I can't really say anything about her..I really, really enjoyed the first part of the book, the part before the drug bust - it has everything I'm looking for in a great book: suspense, romance (kinda like Romeo & Juliet - at first, well I said kind of :) ), a twist and a big bang, so to speak...Both characters are great, I especially liked Miguel Ortega, Gabriel's ""love interest"", like the blurb gives away..The 2nd part (which was good as well) felt more like a sequel to the first one - but I'm not entirely happy with how things turned out with Gabriel. This spoiled the story for me at some point.Maybe, that's just me - I mean, I'm not totally against this kind of storyline, at least when expecting it at some rate, but I was totally surprised by this course of events, I did not expect that at all.(God, I probably sound nuts here trying to review this novel without giving away too much of the storyline ;D)So, my advise: Read the book yourselves! It is highly enjoyable.",1
I enjoyed reading this book. The drama of a world not the much different from our on only that they or shifters . The story line was well put together .The sex scenes were sizzling ! I can't wait to read the next book in the series. There or some old fashion values in this book when it came to the families but I think any one can relate to that situation on there own if you have a older brother or in this case 3 older brothers being butt heads!,1
"I liked the story. I liked the idea. I think the errors were a little distracting but I admit its 10 times better then I could have done. That said, I wish the ending wasn't so abrupt and without little more information on the world being reviled as the fog went away and more information on the fog itself. Good story overall. I think worth a read. I enjoyed it.",1
"WOW WHAT A RIDE!  JUST WHEN YOU THINK THINGS ARE GOING TO SLOW DOWN THE AUTHOR SETS YOU OFF SPINNING ON ANOTHER QUICK RIDE.  I STAYED UP PAST MY BEDTIME TO FINISH THIS ONE  I HAVE READ ONE OTHER BOOK BY THIS AUTHOR AND DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL, A BIT MUSHY FOR ME BUT, THE ROMANCE ANGLE IN THIS ONE IS JUSTIFIED AND NOT TOO INTENSE",0
"This novella had a fairly interesting premise, but the heroine spent too much time acting like a spoiled willful child, which, to be fair, she was. Too often, though, I would have been happy to slap some sense into her. There could have been some redemption for the story at the end, but the author clearly does not believe in happily ever after. It was extremely disappointing and downright depressing to me. Don't bother with this one.",0
"NO SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 of a paranormal erotica series with animal-shifters created by science. Fast, fun read. This is NOT a typical werewolf/werecat story. These shifters are pure animals- brawn and brute over sexy military men. This is a fun story with some very hot erotica, but you need to be ready for a ""rough ride"" to enjoy it. It really shocked me at first, but I adjusted and thoroughly enjoyed myself.SEXUAL CONTENT: Here's where you need to be prepared. Orgy, voyeurism, m/m, anal, oral, and just crazy, wild, animalistic indulgence abound here. If you can get past the sex while in animal-like state, then it is really hot, but I found that a little off putting at first. It isn't all like that, but it happens. The beastliness was completely offset by the characters, however- they were very well written to make it all work.PLOT & CHARACTERS: Plot was a little unclear at first. There's a military experiment gone wrong and it's being continued to some degree by those with no conscience... but it takes you some time to figure it all out. Luckily, the characters you are spending the time with are a TON of fun. It's a ""boy's club"" set up, which I automatically love so you have the camaraderie of a group of sexy men and then a strong, independent woman shows up who can keep up and give what she gets. Strong, sweet characters.BOTTOM LINE: This is a bit of light-hearted, heavy-lusting fun. It's a little absurd and a lot funny and very sexy. All in all a pretty good start for a series I can't wait to enjoy.RECOMMENDATIONS: (though none of these are quite as sexually... extravagant.)1. Nalini Singh'sSlave to Sensation (Psy-Changelings, Book 1)- romance series which features weres and psychics, but also carries plotlines with some substance2. Christine Feehan'sShadow Game (GhostWalkers, Book 1)- paranormal romance series that focuses on characters who have gained psychic powers through medical experimentation. Fits the ""boy's club"" set up.3. Alyssa Day'sAtlantis Rising (Warriors of Poseidon, Book 1)- humorous, but intense. Another ""boy's club""- the lonely protectors of the lost city begin to find their mates4. R.G. Alexander's steamy vampire/were/witch romance series:Regina in the Sun (Children of the Goddess)5. Jacquelyn Frank'sJacob (The Nightwalkers, Book 1)- demons, were, vamps and other fae finding their better halves in races that should be the enemy6. Kresley Cole's slightly more adventurous  and intricate magical romance series (never mind the ridiculous title):A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)7. Gena Showalter'sThe Darkest Night (Hqn)- ""Boy's club"" set up- sexy, demon-possessed immortals looking for true love in a world of hidden magical creatures",1
Trust is a hard thing to earn but so easy to lose. This is a story of two very different beings who were both betrayed but learn to trust and love again in the arms of each other.,1
"I love Dracula.  I love Sherlock Holmes.  This book was plodding, simplistic, boring. Neither of the leads made this worth the time to read it.",0
I was pleasantly surprised by the real-world perspective McCray brought to this story. The female lead demonstrates growth without being whiny and the male lead is developed with an interesting Native American flavor. Indian Moon will satisfy readers that enjoy romance but it also appears to other readers that crave more than just a love story. I found the theme of commercial development vs. environmental preservation interesting as well and that added yet another layer of interest for me as someone that does not typically read romance novels.And any book with both a Rob Zombie AND a Motley Crue reference in it are cool with me ;)This a great beach read. You won't be disappointed.,1
"James and Lorna were drawn to each other from the very first. He was a doctor and she in medical school. When she became pregnant, they married, but she lost the baby. Lorna went into a deep depression where she shut James out. Their brief marriage ended in a divorce, but they never got over their few months of bliss. When a car pile up brings injured Lorna to James's ER, they are thrust back together, but the old wounds haven't healed, and Lorna is afraid to talk about the past.I hated the opening where May, the older nurse, was recalling all the evidence of James's sexual prowess. In fact, I was so disgusted I almost quit reading and deleted it at that point, but then it got better when Lorna, his ex-wife, came into the picture. I did like the novella, although it had steamy sex scenes I could have done without. The story and characters were interesting.",1
"PLOT: Lila's father is going to lose his business. Lila can tell the stress is affecting her father's health. So she goes off to confront the man who's responsible. Hunter takes one look at her and is immediately attracted. His mistress had just left him because of scars he sustained to his face in a car accident. Hunter proposes a deal. If she'll become his mistress for three months, he'll stop trying to ruin her father's business.PROS: Lila and Hunter are likable. Their chemistry is HOT. The author does a good job of developing these characters so that you really get to care about them. Excellent plot and story development will keep you hooked.CONS: None.5 STARS: Mistress to the Beast is a great romance.

"This was a great little addition to the series, I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!",1

"Cole Winchester isn't really sure why he's hesitating over marrying his girlfriend.  Well, that's not entirely true - Cole knows why, he just doesn't want to admit it to himself and most especially to others.  But when he comes across Eric Radcliff his libido and fantasies get out of control.  Will Cole be brave enough to admit what he really wants and see where this attraction to Eric will take them?Eric Radcliff has always had the hots for Cole and when Cole trips over him at the beach it seems his interest might be returned.  But Cole is sending so many mixed signals that Eric might just have to satisfy himself with his fantasies.  Will Cole ever let them explore passion together or will he keep denying himself?Taboo Desires is a wonderful steamy romance.  Cole and Eric are absolutely explosive together and you won't be able to help wanting them for your own.  Cole is endearing as he wrestles with himself and his hidden desires, while Eric is adorable and charming in his certainty of himself.  Taboo Desires is the perfect read for a time when you are looking for some light, but steamy, entertainment that is mostly about the anticipation and the satisfaction of getting what you desire without dealing with the aftermath.  I really enjoyed Taboo Desires and I will be looking forward to reading more books by Amanda Young.SabellaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"Trite story, poorly edited. Before you write anything about firearms most people would do some basic research.  An experienced police officer would never give a family member a small caliber like an.25. Smith and Wesson never made a .25 cal revolver.  A revolver loads by a cylinder. A semi-automatic loads by a clip.",0
"I'm with the other reviewer who wondered what book those who wrote such glowing reviews read!  This was really poorly written....I finally made myself look at the typo problem as humorous....I mean, words are a writer's bread and butter and Mr. Knight really should be a little more respectful of his tools....and his readers.  I was fond enough of his main character and the ego the guy carried around....but, puleeeeeeeze, the metaphysical stuff was so lame I was almost embarrassed for the poor writer.  I think deep thinking is a little beyond his scope?  Anyway, I can't recommend wasting time on this one.",0
I love it.  If fits snugly into the Kindle Fire.  I wish the cord was a little longer so I can charge & use the device at the same time.,1
"I bought both this book and Golden Eyes (they are related) in order to try out a new author.  I enjoy the shape shifter genre, so wanted to see if I would like her work.  Both books had potential, I thought, but I really wasn't interested in the sex - too much, too fast and certainly not traditional.  No real buildup in a relationship first - just jump into bed.  I was looking at some of her other books (she has a lot of them), but they warn of the same kind of sex, so I am probably not going there.",0
From boot camp at great lakes to the forestall and onto the sellers. This book was ok but sometimes it just rambled on with the radio man lingo. I have read better but parts of it was ok.,0
"Since it was a reaaally short story, I have to say all I can tell you about this book is : SEX and a big screen tv. See why I asked if a guy was the author!? The main character looks at herself naked in a mirror and the man thinks hes in love,hmmmm. I don't understand why the characters react the way they do, why are they in ""love"" and meant to be? This book offered me nothing that would have me begging for more as I turned the pages.",0
"This picks up exactly where the first one left off, in fact repeating the last page or so but from Becky's perspective.  I especially love the author's sense of humor, and the fun-loving way the characters interact.  It kinda takes me back to my college days, when we were all up in each others business, and giving each other hell over every little thing.  Just fun!",1
"Unlike Blind Date, I didn't enjoy this book. The sex scenes were ehh-- and there wasn't much of a story. The first few pages were great and they were leading to something but it got to the middle and i got lost. There should have been some story when the characters are engaged. It jumped from sex to we're madly in love to marriage in a chapter. And the deportation part-- really?Truly a let down.",0

"This is a prequel to a series that I happened upon while it was free.  There are some good things and some not so good things about this prequel.The good:Interesting post apocalyptic type world where one can be killed for meager supplies and gas is like gold to all who wish to move to other places.  The action scenes (theft and caught scene) were clear and vivid descriptive wise.  The world purported lends tension just by being.The ""could be better ""Characters are quite thin and shallow.  They are not fleshed well.  Some of that may be due to this is purely foundation and fuller fleshing comes later.  However, one needs be induced by this prequel to move to future reads.  And substance of a bit would aid that if done moreso.  The sex by proximity seems plausible and the past history lends some to that.  However, this reader did not feel like it was a true match chemistry wise (overall) - but more a draw of common bond based in spirit portion over the people connecting on baser level.  So, one can see the need for them to bond storywise - but it felt somewhat forced with one character less than enthusiastic (seeming) .The ""new world "" order or whatever to rebuild was interesting and (even for shortfalls cited in review) I can see interest in reading the first in series to see if the outline given here forms substantially.  Many will enjoy - but, with this prequel alone I find skipping it and moving to series (if description interests) would be okay too as this is ""okay "" - but not a whole lot more.Christine",0
"This is absolutely the best book I have read in long time.

"This story jumped right in with both feet and left me scrambling with all the questions until it slowed down a bit and I was able to catch up.  It made for a good attention grabber.  Now while I don't mind that feeling when it comes to a plot line in general, I'm not so keen on it when it comes to the romance side of the plot so I read this one with mixed feelings in the beginning.  Glad I gave it a chance.  It still wouldn't be my favorite romance plot, but it turned out to be a fun story.Dev drives out to a predetermined meeting place to meet the alpha of the pack in the area he plans on relocating too.  Just as he arrives, he witness the alpha and his betas punish the pack omega.  They are holding him down getting ready for a rape and Dev rescues the smaller man.When Dev gets the guy away, he discovers that the handsome man is his mate.  Laine and Dev accept the circumstances quickly.  Laine fills in the situation of what is going on with the bully alpha to Dev and Dev realizes that he will have to take the guy on if he wants to stay in the area.Dev is part-owner in a construction company and his friends and part-owner join him.  The alpha steps up his aggression towards Laine forcing Dev's hand.  But even though that Laine is rather a klutz, he wants to help Dev take on the alpha and his betas.It is a novella length story so the plot jumps in and gets going quickly.  The shifter world described here includes the idea that when the wolves find their mate, there is a bond made.  Sometimes I don't mind this, but it happened before I had a chance to really get to know the characters so I wasn't sold on this relationship until late in the story.  These two went at it hot and heavy before they barely got past learning each other's first names.  Now don't get me wrong, I learned to like both characters once I got to know them and I liked them together.  Laine's klutziness and his sweet temperament were cute and Dev's patience and gentleness with Laine was nice.  It was not hard picturing Dev as a pack alpha just because of the two sides to his personality.  He liked to be in charge, but he was also very protective.  And that reminds me of another thing about this particular shifter world, I liked the idea of the different designations for those involved in the pack.  We are all familiar with alphas, and get the idea of betas who are the alpha's lieutenants, but I thought the inclusion of the lesser used omega or peacemaking wolf role was pretty cool.It was a light quick read that I can recommend to those who enjoy PNR that is more on the passionate side and isn't very dark.",0
Not liking this and will probably never use it. Have to go through a million pages in order to get to where I want. Hard to maneuver through...,0
"I love stories of mistaken identity. Lords and Ladies and all things proper co-exist in this plot with a twist, as the hero and heroine work together to solve a mystery and uncover a devious plan. Great deal on the price, too!",1
I started reading this because it was a free download but after 5 chapters I give up as this book is not for me. I didn't find the humor in it and while I sometimes enjoy dark this was beyond and bordered on sick.,0
Holy hotness this is a good book. Erotica plus a hot and sexy SEAL is a sure bet for a great story. I love the characters. The story line is a fairy tale that turns into a hot and steamy romance. Well written. A great add to your tbr list. Recommended read.,1

"""A Hard Man is Good to Find"" takes match-making to a new extreme.  Knowing that her two closest friends were perfect for one another - if they would stop hating each other long enough to figure it out - Callie left her house to both of them under the condition that they live in it together for one year.  After the year was up, they could either sell it and split the proceeds or, as she had hoped, live there together having ""wild monkey sex in every room of the house at least once a day.""  Kelsey and Clint had not expected this to say the least when they attended the reading of the will of their recently departed very close friend.Kelsey is an independent woman who becomes enraged just about every time she is near Clint Duncan, although she is not oblivious to the fact that her nipples are almost always erect in his presence as well.  She is simultaneously infuriated and completely turned on by him.  Clint's reaction to Kelsey, both physically and emotionally, is pretty much the same.  The reader is treated to a perhaps predictable tale where the two protagonists slowly begin to overlook their irritation and expose their infatuation for one another.One thing that I really liked about this book is that from the beginning, it was no secret that Kelsey is in fact a spankophile.  She references spanking in the first few pages and quickly delves into a spanky daydream featuring her nemesis, Clint, himself.I like the majority of Carolyn Faulkner's spanking fiction.  She writes very well and draws the reader in.  Her books seem to follow the typical romance novel template: ordinary woman meets tall hunk and initially HATES him - but eventually starts to see his finer qualities.  They eventually have a whirl wind romance and declare complete and total devotion to one another.  The only difference is that Carolyn's template includes a session over the knee of the tall hunk every chapter or so (which I have to say is a great twist on the typical romance novel).  I am a huge fan of Carolyn Faulkner as I love occasionally getting lost in a tale of love and spanking.  If you are looking to spend an afternoon like this, then I would definitely recommend you pick up a copy of ""A Hard Man is Good to Find.""Katerina of BottomsUpBookReview",0

The characters are so one-dimensional and uninteresting that the clever plotline is wasted. I gave up a third of the way through.",0

"Being a fan of historical fiction, I was drawn in right away with Children of Salem. This is and area of American history that I have never read a whole lot on and was anxious to learn more about. I found myself going back and researching online what was written in the book to see what was fiction and based on fact. I was suprised to find how historicly accurate Robert W. Walker was and how little I actually knew about the Salem Witch Trials, based on what I have seen on TV and read in the past. A great book for anyone who is interested in history, a fan of mystery, and even romance. Why pay $14.99 or $9.99 for a new release when you can download several of Robert Walkers novels for the price of one new release.",1
"Eastern Texas, 1879At the age of five, Emma Radcliff made the monumental announcement that she is going to marry Rafe Sinclair.  She's done a lot of growing up in the fifteen years since then and has decided that she's not going to marry at all.  Wearing breeches and working horses on her father's ranch suits her just fine.  Only her plans are thwarted when her father insists that she marry Rafe - no if's, and's, or but's.Rafe Sinclair really has no interest in getting married but a stipulation in his grandfather's will forces the issue.  He has to be married by the time he turns thirty or he loses the Circle S Ranch.  Since he's known Emma her entire life she seems like a relatively safe choice but the last thing he anticipates is the little hellcat's insistence that he agree to stay out of her bed.  To make matters worse, little Emma is looking mighty gown up and he's just discovered that he wants her - in every way.Since Emma insists on her no sex clause, Rafe counters her with a clause of his own - that she reserves the right to change her mind and void her clause at any time.  Though still not entirely comfortable with the situation Emma agrees but also requests that she be allowed to work with the horses at the Triple R. They'll both have what they want - well almost.  Things don't go exactly according to plan.  Emma's father refuses to allow her to return to work the horses after the marriage takes place, she counterattacks with the insistence that she takes some of the horses with her.Rafe and Emma marry but no sooner are the vows spoken then the trouble starts.  Emma's always been very attracted to Rafe and Rafe is definitely finding it difficult to adhere to her `no marital privileges' clause.  What's a guy to do when he discovers that is new wife is the sexiest thing on two legs?  Well being a man of his word, he can't just grab her up and take her to his bed, he's going to have to seduce her.  Only Emma's just as stubborn as he is persuasive.  Which one will hold out the longest?Beth Williamson presents readers with yet another wonderful historical tale with her contribution to the LEATHER AND LACE series - BRANDED.  Emma won me over from the very first page.  She's so `in-your-face' and not afraid to go against convention that I couldn't wait to read all about her and find out how or even if Rafe can `tame' her.  Rafe grew up knowing Emma so of course he's never seen her in any sort of sexual way but he's seeing her now and practically salivating just thinking about bedding his own wife.  Ms. Williamson even throws in several supporting characters that you'll love to hate or hate to love, but in either case they're definitely unique and fun.Be sure to keep an eye out for the other LEATHER AND LACE series books.  Rebecca Goings contribution HIGH NOON was released on November 13th and Melissa Schroeder's THE SEDUCTION OF WIDOW MCEWAN was released on November 20th.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
"I got this as a freebie for the kindle and I must say for free, it was enjoyable.  The story is a short one, it is about Lacey, who is a personal trainer and appears to have problems keeping men longer than a few months.  Story starts off with her finding her boyfriend cheating on her with her friend Christy.  She didn't feel sadness for Evan, the guy she's been seeing for the past 6 months.  She was more sad about the fact that she was single again, lonely and wasn't sure why she couldn't keep a guy interested.Nick has been Lacey's best friend for the past 5 years so when he heard that she was finally single again, he didn't waste a minute.  He wanted to be with her, to console her, but also to take the opportunity to make her see him as more than a friend.  He has loved Lacey for so long that he would do anything to show her how good they could be together.  He would do anything for her, even if he had to pretend to be her ""sexual teacher"".Once they began their ""lessons"", Lacey couldn't believe all the things Nick was making her feel.  Could she risk ruining her friendship with Nick?  Can they be both friends and lovers?Cute short story, but best of all, it was free.",1

"This book was too depressing and didn't feel like a romance novel. Before I scare you away, let me assure you that it has a HEA so this is technically a romance. Unfortunately, I didn't get it.Detective Inspector James McBride's life is a mess and he doesn't know how to fix it. He's forty years old, divorced and not quite at peace with his sexuality. On the professional front, things don't look good either: his current undercover assignment has him pretending to be an alcoholic and gambling addict in order to infiltrate and bust a human-trafficking ring, but not all the drinking he's been doing lately is exactly necessary to do his job. Needless to say, he ends up blowing his cover and is taken off the case.Reassigned to look after the visiting Israeli ambassador, which is a constable's job and thus unworthy of his rank, McBride feels an instant connection with Tobias Leitner, the leader of the Israeli security team. McBride should know better than to get involved with Toby, who's still recovering from the death of his partner and lover, but fate, in the form of an unexpected brush with death and the kidnapping of McBride's daughter Gracie, conspires to get them together. Can they rescue Gracie, defeat the bad guys, survive to tell the story, and heal one another's heart in the process?Phew, this was not a light read! The story had a dark tone and none of the characters was particularly nice. I didn't like McBride, I didn't get to know Toby well enough to either like or dislike him, and as a result, I didn't care about their relationship. I liked the action scenes, but I don't read romances for them.The plot was too complex to fit the constraints of a novella, and that affected the development of McBride and Toby's romance. In fact, I felt that the focus of the story was McBride's downfall and recovery, and his relationship with Toby was just an afterthought. If I had to classify this book following the rules I know, I'd have to create a new genre: women's fiction with a male character as protagonist. As I'm not a fan of women's fiction and having a man as protagonist makes no difference to me, this book failed to grab me.",0
The story pulled me in from the opening scene and didn't let go until the end of the epilogue.  An excellent example of what a short story should be.,1
"These three short stories from a Christian perspective are certainly inspirational, but reading them -- at least for the non-Christian reader -- is kind of like going out on a date with a figure from a wax museum.  It may look like a living person, but it certainly doesn't feel like a living person.",0
"For a free short story with a bondage party type of theme, I expected more. I wanted the author to make me feel like I was there, but it didn't happen.Jane Porter was a sub who was betrayed by her former Master when she found out he was married. I was glad that she made a stand and left him instead of being his mistress/submissive. You go girl! After that she basically tortures (my use of word) herself into celibacy for an entire year! She plans and attends a party in which she hopes to find herself a new Master. Antonio Villareal was looking was struck the first moment he saw he and knew that he wasn't going to share her with anyone, unless she asked.The sex scenes were pretty hot and I enjoyed reading this story, but I don't think I will read the next one. I do recommend this short story to anyone looking to live the life of a submissive on the prowl. I wouldn't mind going to one of those bondage parties - just to watch though - not to interact.",0

"You Send Me by Toni Blake is a  2009 Harper Collins publication.This very short story with approximately 55 pages centers on a young woman in 1957  named Millie who is in her early twenties but still under the thumb of her parents especially that of her father. While on vacation in Montana,  Millie meets Johnny and it's lust at first sight.  But, Johnny is the type of guy Millie's father would never approve of for his daughter.  So, when push comes to shove will Millie once more submit to her father's will or will she finally stand up for what she feels in the right direction for her life to go?This book is a prequel to &#8220;Letter to a Secret Lover&#8221;.  However, the story can stand on it's own two legs and winds up being a really sweet love story.  Two people who are from very different backgrounds quickly forge a bond that is powerful enough to give them the strength and courage to change the path they are on.I picked this one up in the kindle store during a promo and it was either free or 99 cents.  I see that it is now all the way up to $2.99.  Since half of the book is the story you are paying for and the other half of the book is a preview for a new book by this author, I don't know if I would say the story was good enough to merit such a high price.  If you catch it on sale then buy all means check it out.  But, it took me about 15 minutes to read it,  if that.  Just sayin.This one gets 3.5 stars rounded to 4",1
"It is either hit or miss with me for J.L. Langley and her/his books. But with ""His Convenient Husband,"" the author pulls off the time honored tradition in romance novels - a marriage of convenience - and does it with style. Because Micah and Tucker had a great backstory, the reader was rooting for them to get together from the beginning. Langley's secondary characters, even the 'bad guy,' felt natural to the plot line and gave the reader an overall explanation of why Tucker and Micah marry not for love but to keep their family's ranch. By the end of the book, you were hoping for more: more plot, more sex, more Tucker and Micah's love story...which is always a plus when reading a novella. This is a universe I could visit again. 4 stars for ""His Convenient Husband.""",1
"This was an interesting book. At times it was a bit slow, but I always found myself returning to find out what happened next. I did not find a lot of the editing issues that others mentioned, so it's likely that a new edition has been released with many of those errors corrected.This was a kindle freebie, but I definitely think it's worth the 1.50 that it's currently for sale for on amazon. The author paints a very interesting world, both below and above. The world below is split up into different factions and in some ways strikes me as very 'mad max'. It's nothing particularly new or innovating, but the author makes the characters more than interesting enough to engross the reader.Upstairs is Haven, the fancy place where all the citizens live. We don't get to see a lot of this, only glimpses through the few characters we follow around. Most of them are not particularly interesting, a stark contrast with the characters below. Most of them are a bit cliche, but that changes as the storyline moves along.Overall it's worth a read, and I'm going to be picking up the next one.",0

"MY SOUL TO LOSE is a prequel to the Soul Screamers series. It tells the story of what happened to Kaylee during the week she spent in the psychiatric unit referenced in My Soul to Take.Nash makes a brief appearance early on, but that's it. And there aren't any other romantic interests for Kaylee in MY SOUL TO LOSE either. Most of this short story revolves around her enduring the many indignities of being committed. There is also a mystery introduced with the character and fellow patient Lydia that I'm hoping will be further explained in future books.As an audiobook, and I'm a huge audiobook fan--they're an insomniac's best friend--MY SOUL TO LOSE is pretty good. The narrator is not great, but not distractingly bad a la the narrator for the Twilight Saga. You can listen to a sample before downloading if you're worried. The story is short, only 1 hour and 48 mins. But it provided the perfect little visit back to the folklore infused Soul Screamers universe.This isn't a perfect series, but all the Soul books, including this prequel, have all been light and fun reads. My Soul to Keep is due out on June 1, 2010. I'm already eager for another good scream.Sexual Content: References to sex",0
"I know that this book is old so I guess it doesn't matter, but here goes:  REALLY?!!  I felt cheated as I loved the first two. The hero of the book was intelligent and quick on his feet.  He dodged just about everything that they could throw at him and survive..... only to have his stupidity kick in at this last one?!  Not to mentioned that this last book was quick and in a hurry to end; so I'm done with the Luther Kite books.  I'll be keeping away from anymore of (any) series that he has out....",0
I'm really disappointed as I enjoyed the first three books in the series.  I'm still not sure why the h loved her two Doms. I just did not feel the love at all...she goes undercover to look for her sister - then makes dumb mistakes. Seems like the Doms could have been more sympathetic at times too.  Not sure what they saw in her either....,0
"A pair of lovers with hearts big enough to admit a 3rd man moaning over a dead lover into their loving fold. I do not favor M/M/M much as I find it hard to believe 3 men can share their love evenly without anyone feeling left out and the sex is hard to follow as you have 3 names involved with ""who is doing what to who"". That said this novella is enjoyable, with enough emotions and angst to satisfy. And the M/M/M sex is limited. Less than 90 pages, but the plot is good and we have 3 distinct characters with depth.",1
"Sam and Riley work around a betrayal that slices deep and realise that what they wanted was in front of them all along.This is a quick read, but you won't be disappointed. There isn't much character development (as a result of length), but it makes up for it by being sweet and romantic.",1
"This story takes place far in the future but jumps back to farther in the past without warning. It is at times, hard to follow and has a low character development. It can ramble a lot with chapters that really have no meaning to the story. Missing words, wrong words, words I had to look up. Paragraphs were so long that I had to re-read them to remember what I was reading.In it self, the story would have made interesting reading if one does not get distracted. I would suggest a fair bit of editing, and less over description when writing.A Place of Rest",0
This is a charming anthology. Love Christmas stories and these are all different. Enjoyed them and will probably read them again.,1
"I don't know what others read (those who gave it a high rating) but I definitely didn't read that book. My book was confusing. It's like you have to start with book one. So my suggestion is that it only be sold as a group because you can't pick up one and follow the story. I don't like to read a book and it's like I just joined a conversation and I don't know what the heck we're talking about or why.Now this is just my opinion but I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. It took me forever and three more years to finish. Therefore it gets a no, no, and heck fire NO rating.By the way, I've read other books by this author and I've enjoyed them. But I definitely did not enjoy ""A Lover's Worth - Ramsey V"".",0
The book is okay.  What you think of it depends on what you like to read and that has something to do with personality.  I just didn't  have the feeling that I wanted to get to the next episode at any point in the book.  It explains the difficulties of Latinos building new lives in America.,0
"In light of the fact that these stories are true, I understand some improper language but there are many words that are misspelled and some were totally out of context... I also understand that they were written in the first person view and they were pretty backwards people back in the day... Overall the stories I have read so far (I am not finished yet) have been very interesting and a good portrayal of how things were in those days.  Pretty scary life for the pioneers and settlers but also sad for the Indians who were treated really awful and were used and abused by many white men..After reading the rest of these stories, I really enjoyed them and especially the Purple sage riders series! Wonderful history of days long gone!",1
"Many post apocalyptic stories are very grim. This one isn't. It has a lovely cast of characters, of beings who are trying to build new lives.The pace of the story is easy, like walk on the beach. The story starts with a wolf/human who is banished because the elders of his tribe are afraid of his ideas. On his journey he meets others: a young boy, an orphan and artist, whose body is damaged by the pollution of his former city and a female dolphin/siryn who has been helping the boy to survive and of course a very intelligent dog that they name Misschief.Many other new characters are slowly introduced.The book is infused with the love and healing power of nature. The characters are well defined and they all have a purpose, that they gradually discover.",1
"(Originally posted on SnarkyMomReads)""FERAL DOMINATION"", by T. A. Day, is the first of (currently) four books of the Faldron Shifter series.  As of this writing, it is being offer as a freebie at Amazon.  Typically when I see something published by Ellora's Cave I jump on it; their writers are normally 'safe bets' and really - if it's free, what does it hurt to try out a new author?Um, famous last words.In the overall scheme of things, the storyline was very good & deserves about a 4.5 star rating.  Gionne and Jenna are childhood playmates that become sweethearts with plans to mate - even though he is lupine and she is feline.  (In other words - they want to see if cats & dogs CAN play well together...)  Due to his father's illness, Gionne pushes Jenna away and she is NOT understanding of this and turns her back on him.  Fast forward a few years and she is asked to be a ""guest"" at Gionne's compound while the lupines grant the felines some much needed land to hunt on.  This story has REALLY REALLY HOT sex scenes - menage & anal are some, so you are warned! - and lots of miscommunication due to some betrayals by one of the pack members.What this story doesn't have?  Descriptive communication.  At times I felt like I was reading stilted, Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator style dialogue.  It was driving me nuts.  (NOT - ""It was driving me nuts!"", she exclaimed emphatically.)  Like I said, though, this is the first of the series (published in 2009) and is over 300 pages.  I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that as the author got into the series, the dialogue flowed a bit more easily.Hey - it's a free trial right now.  Doesn't hurt to try, right?  And if you really like shifter romances - this could be the start of one of your favorite series!  YAY!",1
"I liked this story, I only wish it was longer. Hopefully the author can revisit the relationship with a sequel.I don't read menage stories that often but I do have to say that I appreciated this one for telling an entertaining from the perspective of all the characters so that you know how they were feeling and it wasn't just about sex. Also much appreciated is the twist that the exes were the two men. Most of the menages I've read, the men don't interact and are solely focused on the woman so I liked seeing the change of having the men sexing each other too.",1
I would like to recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good book written by a knowledgeable author.,0
"I'll preface by saying this: the other day I bought a pack of gum, and it cost me $1.39.I can't say it was money well spent, but I'm not complaining.I bought this eBook for $.99--I've even seen it advertised for free.At $.99, I consider Rogue Hunter: Gaia #1: Into the Abyss money well spent.I recently purchased a Kindle, and I've been on a short story kick lately. I download mostly free stories, but I've read this author before, and wanted to read more of his work. Mr. Hendrickson also wrote The Legend of Witch Bane, a young-adult fantasy tale, and one I highly recommend.I downloaded Rogue Hunter: Gaia #1, and finished reading it in one night.I've read some negative reviews of this book, and I can even understand some of the complaints. First, this is not actually a book in the traditional sense, more like a short story. Correction: Rogue Hunter is more like part of a story. It is only fifty or sixty pages. That being said, I knew it was told in parts, so that was no surprise to me. As I stated earlier, I felt it was money well spent. Those who complain about a free story...well, I don't quite understand.Overall, I enjoyed the story. I thought Zyra was a strong female character. I felt the storyline was interesting enough for me to want to know what happens next--which is, of course, the point of a good story. I'm not a hefty reader of sci-fi, and I appreciated that Mr. Hendrickson didn't make it complicated. I wasn't lost in technicalities of space travel and science, instead thrown into a fun and exciting story.As for the negatives: I felt this book was a bit abrupt. Not so much that it was short, but I felt the cliffhanger ending was mid scene, that it needed a bit more. At times, the dialogue was off, but nothing that distracted me from the story. A few other things, but overall the story was enjoyable. As I stated earlier, it was money well spent.Mr. Hendrickson is a good writer. I feel he has a promising career, and look forward to reading more of his books. He is one of the few small press/self-published authors I enjoy reading. His description is always good, and the story is always intriguing.If you enjoy fantasy or science-fiction, I suggest you reading Mr. Hendrickson's work.I'll be downloading the second book in the Rogue Hunter series soon...Vincent Hobbes",1
I am in love with this series.  J. R. Ward is an excellent writer and this short story is a great addition to the background of Zsadist and Bella.  Wish she would write more of these. Would love to read Rhage and Mary or Wrath and Beth.  Will more of the brotherhood become fathers in the future?,1
"NASCAR driver Jake Henson takes refuge near the White River in Arkansas Ozarks National Forest; he is physically recovering from a boating accident that left him injured and his best friend dead.  Next door to the cabin he borrowed is Stacy Carter, and her Yorkie Oscar; she borrowed her brother's cabin to escape the media who have made her, daughter of a notorious politician, into an amazon because she disarmed a thief.Oscar introduces the temporary neighbors to one another.  Each is instantly attracted, but both hides their history from one another as he believes she detests publicity and she assumes he will detest her roots.  Besides this is a short fling in the hills.  Neither expected love to meet them at the finish line, but though they must reveal what they concealed, they fear the relationship will end once the checkered flag is dropped.ALMOST FAMOUS is a fun contemporary romance starring two celebrities taking a respite from fame.  Jake and Stacy are likable characters while Oscar is cute as he believes he is a raging Doberman.  Fans will enjoy the story of two people hiding critical parts of their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s from their beloved.Harriet Klausner",1

"Eden LaCroix was trying to save the community center she was committed to preserving when Billy Buchanan breezed into her office announcing he was the engineer brought in as the consultant on the project.  She couldn't believe her eyes because the last time she had seen him he had literally fled, leaving her with her prom dress around her ankles at the Motel 6, ten long years ago.  She hadn't missed the almost physical relationship they had, but the friend that she trusted and confided in.Billy had reached a crossroads in his life.  He was at the top of his game in his professional life, but nothing else in his life satisfied him.  When he was asked to consult on a project in his hometown, he jumped at it.  Eden had never been far from his thoughts, and now he was going home to claim the woman made for him.  He didn't expect this to be an easy journey for him because his treatment of her so many years ago had been nothing short of abysmal.  His behavior was only one barrier keeping them apart, and the other was that his decision on the community center would have such a huge impact on Eden's life.  Billy could very well be stripping her job out from under her if his recommendation is to condemn the current building housing the center.  With all the issues circling them, Eden tried to resist the pull she felt toward Billy, but it was inevitable that they succumb to the intense heat between them.Eden is a strong character that has not had an easy life, but the loss of Billy was one loss she never recovered from.  Billy realized his error in judgment early on, and was back to claim the woman that had held his heart since high school.  While Eden scrambled to keep her armor in place, Billy did everything he could think of to penetrate it.  Well-rounded characters, but the story is not up to the caliber I expect from this author, but still an enjoyable read.",1

"I understand that during the time these stories were written they were quite popular. For my taste, I thought the blind detective got around too easily. Just was not believable.

"This light read packed a big punch! The author took on so many themes and emotions central to 20-somethings growing up and growing into the people they were meant to be. And while several of the plot lines and twists were trite, It was an enjoyable read. Though, I think younger readers--I'm 28--would likely enjoy the book more than I did.One topic I saw several other reviewers mention was the author's use of ""episodes;"" most seem to find the book choppy as a result of the brief scenes. I felt very much the same as I began reading but I quickly realized that the vingettes were effective in conveying a mood. Today's world is fast-paced and hectic...especially for young adults who are still searching for themselves and their places in life. The brief ""episodes"" reminded me of that throughout the book. I'm not sure if that was intentional on the author's part, but well done.",0
"When Reaper Eanan Tohre is brought to the Citadel, he doesn't know what lies ahead for him. He's not aware of having done anything wrong, but he still feels uncomfortable. And he's horny. Being a Reaper means it is easy to find a woman more than willing to help him with his needs. Why he's been summoned and placed before the three Gatekeepers of the Citadel is something he's not been told, and the stares from the beautiful women make him more than a little uncomfortable. The information they give to him is more than shocking, and it takes a little time to convince him it's true. Time they are more than willing to spend on the man.Embrace the Wind was a tantalizing taste into Charlotte Boyett-Compo's world of Reapers. This story is better read in the order of the series. I didn't and was still able to enjoy it, but was a little bothered by what I missed in between Owen's tale and this one. Embrace the Wind was a fun romp with a delicious sampling of what her Reapers are capable of.ErysReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"All of her life, Alexandra Riley has wondered about her father and mother.  Growing up without her mother, her father was everything to her and they are very close.  However, there is one thing that Alexandra doesn't know, but before her father can explain more fully, she is swiftly taken away by the man that just tore her entire world apart - Joshua Striker.  It seems that Alexandra isn't just a normal, run of the mill young woman. She is the daughter of one of the most powerful Alpha wolves to ever exist and then to top off her already crappy day, it seems she is going into heat and no man will do for her what she knows Joshua Striker will.Alexandra's Legacy by N. J. Walters was entertaining but somewhat redundant at times.  Alexandra and Joshua were constantly battling the bad guys and I was often overwhelmed by their continuous fights and battles and the danger they were frequently in.  Alexandra's Legacy stalls somewhat while Alexandra and Joshua are trying to get out of town - it takes them at least two days to do so and I thought that was an inordinately long period of time to have to read about them running.  That said, I will be the first to note that Joshua Striker was loyal, brave, and very sexy.  His countenance and ability to protect Alexandra was noteworthy.  Their love scenes were hot and emotional, but somewhat scripted.  I never grasped the idea that they truly cared for one another and when that happens, I get so disappointed.  N. J. Walters' writing style shines in Alexandra's Legacy, but I just didn't like the constant danger mode of the entire book. I wanted Alexandra and Joshua to be able to unhurriedly fall in love and that just didn't happen.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",0
Great twist turning and mystery plot.  Unable to stop reading until the very end.  Definitely a must read for mystery and suspense readers. Definitely recommend.,1
"The author appears to draw a conclusion then includes only the facts that fit with his opinion. Historians still argue because the reasons for fighting in the war were as varied as the participants. First person accounts in diaries and stories handed down through generations show us the minds of soldiers from diverse economic,  educational, and religious backgrounds.",0
"Whipped Cream Reviews stated:  ""I wholeheartedly recommend Dare to Believe to anyone who wants to take a short vacation from reality.""If that is intended as sarcasm, I agree.A CEO wearing no shirt to a company party?  Even if it is a masquerade?  Seriously.And a CEO having a dance with a female employee and kissing to that level as soon as they are on the floor?  Yeah, right.I am new to this genre, but read it to see what a paranormal fantasy novel was about.  The story had potential and could have been a lot of fun, but not one single story thread was developed.  Characters were interesting, but when Leo ran around saying, ""Mom!"" and wrestling with his sister I couldn't quite buy into the alpha male hero in him.  And when he ran back and forth on the driveway while Ruby was kidnapped, he sounded downright silly, but only because of the way the author handled it.I thought the book was for teenagers - perhaps it is - it used plenty of slang - perhaps not the most current - and the sex sounded like the dirty notes middle school girls used to pass to middle school boys quite a number of years ago.  Love equals A_s, and P___y, and rabbit vibrators?  etc?  My,my.After I have read a book, I either keep it on my Kindle for rereading, or I archive it if it is not worth repeating.  I archived it.  I won't delete from my Kindle account because I don't want to accidentally buy it again - even for free.I gave it two stars because it had complete sentences, and it got me interested in Irish mythology.",0

"This is a very hot, very engaging, very intriguing story that pulled me in, made me feel, descriptive and well-done as far as creating a plot instead of just throwing a few sex scenes together, but then just when it was really getting good ... I get the ""read the next installment"" message. Like so many people, I'm really getting tired of a story just getting going and then hitting a wall and having to shell out cash to read more (sometimes a little, sometimes a heck of a lot).  I understand the reasoning behind it from the income for the author side of things, but I fell for that with one story that started out great, spent $3.99 for the next installment just to have it fall flat (which made me very glad I'd only paid for part 2, and didn't buy parts 3 and 4 ahead of time!) Once burned and all that. Will I pay for  more of this story?  Perhaps, but not immediately.",1
I'm glad I decided to buy the bundle and honestly I wasn't surprised it was good. I cannot decide which story was better. They were all full of action from beginning to end. I realize these stories were written in 2008 but I didn't care. The author knows how to pull the characters out and the dialogue was not immature. Do I recommend the book absolutely.,1
"A little bit more sex than story, Bound for the Holidays by Mackenzie McKade is a hot read. Quick and flirty, this book is as difficult to pass up as Angie's invitation to spend the night with her boss. Mentions of family ground both main characters but really it's a simple story of the beginning of their relationship. By the end, I wish I could've known more but as it is, I enjoyed Angie and Ryan's story.Already resigned to spending Christmas alone, Angie cannot believe it when she finds herself in the arms of her new boss at the office party. Their attraction is hot and his promises of things to come set her on fire. And then when she finds herself with not just one, but two gorgeous men - a powerful executive and one sexy cowboy - her holiday wishes are fulfilled.Ryan has never considered not sharing his women with his best friend Wade so it was only natural to introduce him to Angie. But when she stirs feelings inside him, Ryan realizes that one decadent night of m&eacute;nage was enough and now he wants her all to himself. Finding that time and understanding that they were on the same wavelength only reinforces his feelings.To Ryan's surprise, what starts out as hot sex turns into something deeper. I just wish the story of Angie and Ryan could've happened without the m&eacute;nage with Wade. It just didn't seem necessary and it felt like a dark spot on their beginning. Regardless, I liked the characters and found myself looking for the second book in the series to see if Wade gets his HEA.RATING: 4 Chocolate-dipped Strawberries - originally posted for Guilty Indulgence reviews[...]",1
"I know it's by a classic author & I feel I should join the positive reviewers here, but I'm afraid I can't.The book starts well enough, with a daring prisoner-of-war camp escape, by balloon, followed be a harrowing flight through the storm & a forced landing on a Pacific Island. Then the plot weakens....One of the book's biggest mysteries must be that, whilst huge numbers of indiginent Pacific islanders evolve by scratching out a living fishing off a sand-bar of an island, this extemely large, visible (it has a huge mountain in the middle) island, remains undiscovered. A pity because this surely must be one of the most verdant, farming-friendly, mineral wealthy islands on Earth. It is also extremely well-stocked with all manner of useful, & tasty beasts. Our heroes, in a few short years, manage to become completely self-sufficient & are soon spoilt for choice as to where to abide & what to have for supper.I would estimate that a full eighty percent of the plot is dedicated to the ingenious, almost miraculous, development of the island's bounty. Our five heroes are the most innovative of castaways; nothing is beyond them. During their time on the island they have the know-how & resources to produce bricks, pottery, ironware, gunpowder, nitro-glycerene, etc. etc., even introducing a telegraph system & no detail is spared in the descriptions of each operation. As a consequence the book reads like a cross between Handyman's Journal, Construction Weekly & Farming Monthly.The castaways are a deadly boring bunch. They quickly become firm friends; respectful, tolerant & pass their time in mutual hero-worship & devotion. They are such a 'hail-fellow & well met' group that there is a complete absence of any sort of jealousy, resentment, discontent or moaning; indeed a complete absence of any emotional excitement.There is a mystery involved but I didn't feel it worth the effort of wading through the massive amount of technical details to find out the end result.Look here for blandness & do-it-yourself tips; look elsewhere for adventure.",0
"This is a short tale that doesn't feel like just another short story.  It's a fantasy.  It's a horror.  It's a fairy tale.  It's a detective novel.  This novella actually crosses many different genres and styles and makes for an entertaining afternoon's read.The society and social structure of the town or Rannit is hinted at but not explored in any detail.  Religions, curfews and trolls are presented as if they are common knowledge - and that makes them intriguing. I'm glad there are other books set in this world as I want to get to know it better.Tuttle's writing style is tight and entertaining.  My first thought when I finished reading was it felt like reading some Poe only the lighter, more amusing version.  I really like that I didn't know where the story was going as well as not knowing who would live and who would die.  It's a lot like Neil Gaiman in that respect.",1
"I thought this would be a pleasantly spine-tingling read for the Halloween season.  It was a good book, no question about it, but it didn't have the feeling of suspense and/or thrill that I was expecting from the description.  There was plenty of build-up regarding the wood, but very little actual action within the borders of the wood.  The story of the 'haunted' wood was more a backdrop (and deus ex machina, I'm afraid) for the story of Izzy and her abusive ex-husband.  Most readers will enjoy the story so long as they aren't expecting something more in line with 'horror'.  The writing was done well, the characters were believeable, though not always likeable (I personally did not LIKE Izzy at all, though I could sympathize with her), and Kindle formatting was fine.  The writing was worth probably 4 stars, but I took one off due to the fact that this was promoted as more of a 'horror' or 'suspense' genre, which it really wasn't.",0
"I like story's that are unusual, likeHold Me Closer, Necromancer. This one is unusual, too. And I'm not too sure what I think about it.I have so many more questions after reading this book, than I had when I started it.Jessee's remembers his background so very well. Or does he? He remembers his sister, Emily, very well. Or does he? He remembers his foster parents very well. Or does he?Sarah, and her parents, invite this homeless young man to stay with them. They seem determined to accept him as one of the family, even when he doesn't want that.Jessee keeps seeing a scene of a man, dirty and restrained, being tortured. But he doesn't know who it is, even when the man's voice in his head says ""Help me"".I really don't know what to say about the book, except that I recommend it. I wish that the ending had explained more. Or had been different.The very last chapter is extremely intriguing, and leads me to wonder if there are other books coming after this.",1
"I know romance involves a lot of pent up emotions, psychological readings, expectations fulfilled etc... Annabelle Lee focuses first on physical attraction and goes into details about the playing out of this physical attraction. Which is normal, because without it there couldn't possibly be a book. The author apparently enjoys giving all the lengthy details of a scrumptious carnal banquet, in tasty words (nothing vulgar).A light read. Remember this is fantasy only, and don't get your expectations high on finding the same type of relationship, and this book is perfect romance 21st Century genre: inexperienced woman meets experienced hunk falling deeply for her personality and giving her the time of her life in bed.",1

"Oddly, I found the story line engaging but I was disappointed by the fact that it is a precursor to a second book and I really couldn't see the point for a second book.  There were a number of interesting themes to the story but I am not inclined to read the second book because there was no sense of an overarching goal that had to be reached or some kind of surprise ending.  Characters were interesting but except for the main female they lacked significant depth.  The genesis of Malcolm introduces the idea of visitors from another planet but again it was not so interesting that I will be inclined to look for the second book.  In fact I read Uprising a few months ago and had to read it again before removing it from my kindle to be sure that I hadn't accidentally missed reading it.  I guess the lack of any real excitement in the story made it forgettable, hence, at best it was OK.",0

"The NYT is way over-rated. Just a few examples. On their first page, they talked about saving the nation's energy by painting roofs white. Any white paint? No, special white paint from government labs! It turns out any old white paint will do, that a government program is not necesaary, but the NYT did not say so. Irresponsible. In the area of health reporting, Pope wrote a silly article about a Dr. Kesler's book about food. She did not mention that, as head of the FDA, he was engaged in running battles with vitamin and food manufacturers for years. Many of these battles he lost in the courts, which is now why we can use aspirin for heart treatment, which is just as good as the expensive biotech drugs the FDA was touting. Uncritical and irresponsible reporting. A dereliction of the journalist's duty.And what about the economists like Krugman who don't have a clue about how to save the nation's economy. Yet they pontificate in those pages.If you are a times reader, i encourage you to find better sources.Later...To continue this rant, I posted a comment on the NYT website in response to an article. My tone was reserved and systematic. The subject was the blocking of medical innovation by the medical bureaucracy and government. (FDA) GUESS WHAT? tHE COMMENT WAS ERASED. They evidently censor comments they don't agree with, or that may offend their advertisers. Is this the kind of society you want? You may not agree with me, but do you want to shut up those you  disagree with? Hint: You could be next.So my objections to the NYT are ethical and moral. Unfortunately, they have become government hacks rather than responsible journalists.",0

This shift happened so suddenly that I really felt the author got to a dead end, didnt know where to go, so she made the girls non-humans to wrap it up.

At least I would know that the story was not just slapped together. I would actually be trying to figure out what was going to change. I will not be continuing with this series.",0
"This is quite a strange book that I still have trouble to classify. First of all the main hero, Brock, was straight for two/third of the book and then he didn't fall in love physically for the other hero Carey, but rather he decided that Carey is a good man, better than all the other people around, and so he wanted to stay with him. On the other hand, Carey was the same, he didn't fall for Brock as a man, but rather as the image the man is for him.Brock is a poster boy of the past; in his early twenties his career is just finished, burnt like thousands of others in the modeling world. He is broken and without a place to stay, and he has no friend to turn for help... and maybe he doesn't want to neither. Then he meets Carey, a 32 years old independent wealthy man; Carey is strange, but he is gentle and caring, and he offers to help Brock for nothing. Neither Brock or Carey are gay, and Carey's offer raises not from a sexual interested, but more from an esthetically point of view: Carey is a wanna-be photographer, and he really likes Brock's easiness in front of the camera. So from their bargain, both of them will have what they want, Brock a place to stay and Carey a free model.When I say that I found strange this book, is due to the fact that for most of the book, Brock is regretting his lost sweetheart from high school or remembering his sexual experiences with women; never he lusts for Carey in a sexual way, if not with a light comment on Carey's muscular body after their exercised together, like a buddy friend could do in a gym.Also Carey is not easy to understand. I believe he helped Brock out of a need for company, he is lonely and without a real interest in life, and play the role of the Good Samaritan with Brock could give him a sense for his life.The book is rather short, less than 80 pages, in fact it's a novella, not a novel. But as I said I find it puzzling but not without interest. So puzzling that pushes me to browse the net to find info on the author, Dan Skinner, and I found a Dan Skinner who is a romance cover artist (like Carey) and who started his career helping a buddy friend with his modeling career (like Brock)...",1
I can not describe how much I did not enjoy this book. It took me 5 months to read it for a reason and I consider 5 days a long time to read a book. So much description and no plot made this book feel like it was 1000 pages long. It just never got anywhere. I cared nothing about any of the characters and finished it only so I could say I did.,0
"How many twists and turns can a mystery take. At every door a new mystery appears it is only when all the doors have been opened and inspected that the solution can become apparent. And then the action begins, it spins you through the country roads as fast as they can be taken.This book centers on the Four Corners where Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and the Ute and Navajo Reservation meet. The descriptions of the attractions of this area had me up on the web researching the Pueblo Indians, and now I really want to visit.

This was a great preview of the series, and it made me even more excited to get started on the first book. It's like an awesome movie trailer getting you pumped up for the actual movie.

"I have had this book for many months and I have attempted to read it several times. The problem I have is that the storyline is excellent, but the writing drags tremendously, in my opinion. I know that some people appreciate this ""full disclosure"" type of writing. I'm just not one of those people. I don't think it's necessary to know the look of the scene at every moment, or the clothes the characters are wearing, or other things that really don't pertain to the story, especially in a story that is supposed to be fast-paced. I understand bringing the characters and scenery to life, but I feel this book goes too far, and it loses me every time I try to read it. I can't recommend this book unless the person who is going to read it appreciates too much explanation (I say 'too much', but I agree that for some, it's not too much - this is strictly my opinion). To reiterate - the storyline is quite interesting and has kept me attempting to read it on several occasions. I just haven't been able to jump the ""too much detail"" hurdle. Maybe some day.",0

"I enjoyed the basic storyline, and the characters were decently fleshed out, but the editing errors made it difficult to truly enjoy the story.  Sentences seeming to end without completing the thought.  Supporting characters whose names seems to change midstory, and then back again.  Many basic grammar errors.  While I realize that some of these e-books are published as a work in progress, completed sentences and continuous character names throughout don't seem like too much to ask for.  Hoping the author will take a second stab at cleaning it up so it might actually be worth paying $.99 for.",0

"Candy Girl is the first book I've read by author Eve Vaughn. This book is a novella so it was a quick read. Julie Bennett is tired of being everyone's pushover. Her co-workers gave her the nickname, Candy Girl, because she keeps a candy dish on her desk. Gabe, Julie's boss, has lusted after her since day one. And he hates how the co-workers take advantage of Julie's kindness and generosity. Gabe is there for her when Julie is betrayed by her boyfriend and cousin. He's there for her and sees it as the perfect opportunity to explore his attraction and feelings for her.I enjoyed the book a lot. I felt sorry for Julie. She's the nice girl who can't tell people no. I saw Gabe as Prince Charming, saving the girl from her wicked step-mother. In this case, her mean co-workers. The attraction and chemistry between Julie and Gabe was believable and hot. This is another book featuring an interracial couple (BW/WM) but while reading the book, race is not an issue. The sex scenes are steamy! Have a cold glass of water nearby while reading.",0
"MY SOUL TO LOSE, by Rachel Vincent, is the prequel novella to her Soul Screamer's series. In My Soul To Take, it is mentioned that Kaylee spent some time in a mental hospital because of her ""condition"". This novella shows the events before and during her stay in the hospital.I was excited to see a few of my favorite characters even for a short time. The inclusion of Emma and Nash was a special treat for me! And the introduction of one new character in particular gave me chills. Lydia is a patient at the mental hospital, and Kaylee is curious about this quiet girl. We later find out the reasoning for her inclusion in this place but a bit of mystery still tingles in the back of my mind.Overall, if you are a fan of this series, you will love this little snippet of Kaylee's life before the series began.",1

"I loved this paranormal romance. In fact, I enjoyed this one a little better than the first in the series. The characters were so appealing and the plot and pace worked well in this quick read. Missy and Tad are great and they complement each other so well. I loved that there was a bit more to their relationship than just the hormonal mating. It was also wonderful to catch up with some of the characters from the first story. I can't wait to read the next Granite Lakes Wolves offering as I'm already in love with both Shaun and TJ. - Theresa Joseph",1
"I thought this story would be a short clean read but found that there were too many factors brought in which only muddied the story and didn't make me want to read a second 'book'.  It had an interesting premise but didn't explore anything in any depth and felt more like the first chapter of a book not a stand alone short story.This author could certainly produce a good quality novel with some editing assistance, the writing was fairly smooth and easy to read and the characters (at least initially) were fleshed out reasonably well.I'll wait and see what else she produces before I scratch her of my authors list.",0
"The year is 2070 and the Earth has turned inwards after a plague outbreak that has left people wary of traveling to other countries let alone into outer space. When a bumbling alien who isn't legally allowed to visit the Earth accidentally gives a university student plans for small portable cold fusion units along with a field that can nullify gravity, the student and the planet find themselves thrust into Galactic trading, ready or not.If this plot appeals to you, you will get your .99 worth out of this book. But before you click ""buy"" understand that plot is all you will get. The characters are tissue paper thin, and the writing is some of the worst I've ever read. Yet, read it I did because the plot was so darn engaging.There are numerous typos, a severe lack of editing (there's even one page where an entire paragraph is repeated), and a lot of truly awkward prose. It's almost as if the book were written in one sitting as a 'stream of consciousness' first draft and then never polished before being published.You won't believe how awkward it is at places unless I give you some examples so here's two choice quotes;1. ""The ship began took on its finished shape...""2. ""The reality turned out to be a bit different as there was little 'control' but many inherited problems. The World Government was incompetent, as most government are incompetent, but the oversight actually provided competency where there was little to none before. The reality of a distant, weak, slightly incompetent government actually worked. It didn't work everywhere because culture and corruption was so endemic but that is reality.""Say what? Honestly, I can't believe that I didn't quit reading after I got to that last example. But that plot! Man, I found the plot engaging.I'm convinced that if the author would pony up for a proper editor, he might have a hit on his hands something along the lines of theSolar Clipper Trader Tales, but as it stands I'd be embarrassed to recommend this book to a friend because as much as I enjoyed reading it, it really is a nothing more than a first draft.Disclosure: I received a free review copy of this book.",0
"It's a short story that's meant to be entertaining and HOTT and it is succeeds in being both. If you go into it looking for the next ""Great American Novel"" you will be disappointed but if your looking for something fun and characters that are ridiculously likable, you'll get what you pay for. It's a simple story that doesn't throw you for any curves or crazy adversity but for 90 something pages, what more could you ask for? It's worth the read, I wish there was a part 2 I would so read it. The characters are too fun and the sex scenes are the best verbal porn I have read in a minute.",1

"I down loaded this on the Kindle Fire I got at Christmas.  It was very inexpensive and it includes 5 of the Edgar Rice Boroughs John Carter stories.  Let me say at first that I liked the Disney Movie &#34;John Carter of Mars&#34; where clearly not a lot of people did.  I was looking for my first book for the Kindle.  I was really pleased by the Kindle and Edgar Rice Boroughs.  The language is from the turn of the last century and since the story takes place in the preceding century seems appropriate.  The stories are a bit formulaic but heck people read Dan Brown's and Clive Cusler's books.  I enjoyed these stories.  I might suggest that the Complete (Unexporgated) collection of Edgar Boroughs stories is only a little more expensive and I'll probably add that next.  It's fun - full of turn of the last century values and while the situations are a little contrived a good read.  Having these short books packaged together disguises that they were originally produced serially and released years apart and probably stand on their own merit a bit better given a bit of breathing space between each book.  Great stuff in a kind of Manifest Destiny way Regards,  Cliffc",1
"I am all for smut in my romance books, but this book seriously had no story. Yes there was a basic premise that could have been pretty interesting, but the main character was a push over and such easy prey for her father's group of hunters. But all that would have been fine (I did get this book for free) if the rest of the story in particular, the hero's best friend, hadn't been portrayed so stereotypically. I mean seriously not every gay guy worries about how they look 24/7 even when their BEST FRIEND is about to be attacked by a group of hunters. This character was incredibly offensive in my opinion to the gay community and for that alone I would not recommend this book.",0
"If I wanted a lesson on how to completely write a book series that will never be picked up by an agent or publishing house with any sense this is it!Jessica is a once-wild-child shouldering the ever waffling level of guilt over her father's ambitions and dedication to others.

She now works in the ER at a local hospital.Ben is a the typical Ivy League movie-good-looking guy with a magical talent for people and medicine. His dad was a missionary who spent his life and energy only doing that; generally acting like a piss poor father figure.I am roughly halfway through the book and there has been NO:discernible conflictstartling situation or event that will change either character's life permanentlysexchange in how the characters interact with each otherToss in some diamond-in-the-rough street kids (one called Mario who is evidently a candidate for MENSA but lives a ""fight club"" life), a lame set up for Ben's grief (a wiped out village in Africa he spent 6 years on a mission to) and we have the weak tug of war in this book. She gets a bit huffy and leaves a bar about now. I was hoping for her to be hurt, aloof, make him work for it and hit a realization he would have to work through. Wrong; he brings pizza to her wayward children at the center and she melts all over him. *disappointed sigh*All in all, I skim the pages to find dialogue or skip the page-long introspection that happens about every 3 pages.Crossing my fingers.",0
"I can understand why more readers haven't discovered H.P. Lovecraft. Many of today's readers prefer the sudden shock of horror featured in modern horror stories and films to Lovecraft's slowly building sense of unease. Lovecraft is the foul breath across the back of the neck or the cold hand that brushes your's in the dark. In other words, it takes a bit of work to appreciate Lovecraft's stories. Written mostly in the 1920s and '30s, Lovecraft may seem a bit outdated, but getting to know his tales is worth the effort.In this volume are 67 of Lovecraft's stories. I would argue that this collection is not necessarily ""definitive,"" but at least it provides a good overview of his work. Here are many stories in his Cthulhu mythos. For the uninitiated, these are stories of ancient gods who are at best indifferent to mankind's existence (and at worst outright hostile). There are also stories that stand alone and are creepy in their own right without the presence of ancient god-like beings. Many of his stories were originally published in the early pulp magazines, but don't let that questionable pedigree scare you away.Among my favorites are At the Mountain of Madness, The Colour Out of Space, Cool Air and ... well, just read them for yourself and pick your own favorites. A couple of minor caveats, however. First, Lovecraft depends more on mood and creepiness to tell his stories. For readers accustomed to horror that is both quick and gross, Lovecraft may seem curiously old-fashioned. Two, Lovecraft was a product of his times. As such, some of his depictions may come across as racist. Beyond that, enjoy these stories - whether you are reading them for the first time or coming back to them after years away. This collection marks an excellent point at which to start.",1
"While I do like stories involving domination, and a menage or 2 (or 3 or 4), I think I enjoy them better when all of the participants are willing and it's consensual. It bothered me when Jenna was made a part of an ongoing menage without her consent or asking how she felt about it. No matter whether she ended up liking it or not. I also didn't like the fact that she had no choice but to have sex in public(during the first dinner). And she was told that having an additional sex partner was for her protection, yet she was always only guarded by Gio's sister. Other than that, I think the story line was okay, but the sex scenes weren't spectacular.",0
"I confess that I had read these before, many years ago.  I got a special offer for the Kindle version of all six books at one time and decided it might be nice to revisit.  And it was.  So much so that at the end of the last one I immediately (at 1:00 AM) popped on site and ordered the next six delivered to my Kindle for uninterrupted reading.  I recommend these if you like a good storyline.  There are Vampires and other aspects of the supernatural as well as political aspects, romance and some violence; albeit of the non horrific type.  Read these anytime, daytime or night time.  You won't loose sleep you will gain a desire for the dark.",1
"The book started interesting, with the main character going to see a pyschic to find out about a hunky guy she'd been dreaming of. I definitely wanted to know more. I just knew it would be a good story. From there immediately downhill. Her best friend Charlie was annoying, she was ditzy and Cannon, who should be a hunky alpha, was everything but. I couldn't finish the story. I stopped when the werewolve got wrangled into attending a hunter's meeting. It was just preposterous. The premise of the story could have been great, but I just could not get invested in the characters or the plot. It was a big disappointment for me.",0
"I have to say that if you like books with Hot, strong alpha males. Then this is the bundle for you. There are 3 stories in here. These books are about werewolves. They are packed full of action, romance and excitement. Each story has it's own little adventure and they follow each other. So if you read these books and you don't get the bundle make sure you read them in order. But I do have to say that the last story was my favorite. It was so heart felt. You have to read it to understand. You feel sorry for the guy. But done worry he has a happy ending. So I would recommend this book to anyone who likes paranormal stories. Now I see that she has another book out now that follows these 3 stories. The name of that is Dark Wolf Rising. Now off the read it. I see that it has good reviews.  I also hope that the character Cian (the Irishman) is in the next book. For he was in all of the other's so far and he is a hoot. You just got to love him.P.S. I also just want to say that this is the first of any books that I have read from this author and I can say that I am impressed and plan on reading more of her books.",1

"Albert Simon, the author, has created a great group of characters.  I would definitely read another in this Henry Wright series.  I love a good mystery, and Mr. Wright has given us one with this novel.",1
"I didn't exactly like this book but I didn't hate it either. It is very long without any real story going on. The Character's aren't consistent and neither is the plot. Here are my problems with it:1. Jasmine (the heroine) she starts off seeming strong and independent. Then becomes immature at times and even submissive and sometimes flaky. Then she's back to acting strong again. She keeps flip-flopping from one way of thinking and acting to another.2. Keilan (her love interest) starts off seeming concerned about scaring her and not wanting to harm her in the beginning. He then turns into a dominating molester within the next chapter or so. He again becomes a sweet romantic love interest halfway in the book then dominating again. It's very confusing who these people are and what they are about. There were many other characters mentioned but you barely know them or understand where they are coming from either.3.The genre didn't seem to fit what was actually in the book. Yes there is some romance, there is fantasy/sci fi but there is also erotica in the book. I wish the author picked a genre and just went with it instead of tried to blend so many in one. She goes into descriptions of each in different scenes but the tone and feel of each scene doesn't always feel like the same book. Primarily the sexual aspects seemed really obscured compared to the rest of the book. I wish she would of just chose Full erotic novel OR Full romantic novel. Neither aspects seemed to blend together or stayed consistent in this book. Also the sexual aspects were so few and far between in the first half of the book that it seemed out of place.4. OK so the book is about a girl with Charmer abilities (can seduce shifter men with her scent basically) who happens to be best friends with a shifter princess. Why should we, as the reader, care about this and what does it have to do with the story itself? I'm not sure about that answer. Again if this was a full erotic novel some of the sexual themes and her seductive powers would make more sense. Like the sexy clothing and underwear in the beginning, is suddenly forgotten after the first &#34;molesting scene&#34; then she's able to wear dresses and regular shirts and pants. What was the point of that?? And a scene where an aphrodisiac was used then backfired to cause a loss of sex drive just didn't fit in. But since this is a romantic/action/fantasy I think?? I'm not sure why we should care or where the author was taking us with all this. Or why so many things were mention just to be resolved and forgotten about within a page or so later.So in a nutshell, there were things about it I liked. Things I didn't like and things that just didn't make sense to me. There were a lot of scenes and characters that could have been cut from this book to give it a more focused feel and shorten it. I hope the author chooses to rework this one and give it  more structure. She had a lot of cool ideas and interesting world she created but I feel her story needs more planing. I will not be following the series but I enjoyed most of the journey in this book.",0

"All Chained Up by Brynn PaulinMy rating: 3 of 5 starsKeera is on the run, she is finally in a place where she feels safe from her stepbrother who is out to kill her.

All I can say is that for 0.00 over at Amazon currently, why not download them and see for yourselves.",0
I liked the story line but the editing was bad. In fact so many of the books I have read on my kindle lack editing good or bad. Good relationship story as well. I recommend it to everyone who likes to read.,1
"I really did love the premise. I am a time travel aficionado, and a baseball nut. That said, the writing was quite simplistic, and the author, in trying to render descriptions, tended to overuse the ones he chose, ""his black haired friend"" comes to mind. Dialogue was in the category of ""Let's put on a play!"" Did I enjoy the book? Yes, at least enough to finish it. Was I glad I spent money for it? To be brutally honest - no - this would have been better for me as a library or garage sale find as even at the two dollar and something price point I felt it was over-priced, although at ninety-nine cents I would possibly not have minded. Lest there be any doubt, even if the book had been free, my feelings about it would have been the same. I loved the baseball trivia. I loved the plot. But again, I found the execution sorely lacking. Hopefully Mr. Fitch will do better in his next (although I understand he has quite a blacklist, which sadly, at this point, I can't see myself reading). Three stars is probably generous, but an extra star than deserved granted for concept.ETA - I tweaked my review a bit. I have found John to be a joy to dialogue with since I wrote this review, and I have downloaded his new free release as Smashwords. I also want to emphasize that John is in the learning stages of writing, but this book should be read by any time travel and/or baseball fan. Especially baseball fans!",0

"As I wrote in my review of Frank Tuttle's other Markhat the finder work, Dead Man's Rain, I really enjoy reading about Markhat the detective and his crazy noir fantasy-world of trolls, half-dead vampires, sooth-sayers, and humans.  I got Dead Man's Rain for free but actually paid the $2 for this ""book"" after finishing Rain and wanting more Markhat.  I put book in quotations because both stories are very, very short.  Adding to the vexation of getting to the end of a short piece of fiction and wanting more, the last 20% or so of the Kindle editions of both Markhat works consist of previews of other Samhain Publishing books which are not even written by Frank Tuttle.  This was very disappointing to say the least.Still, I would pay full price for a FULL-LENGTH Markhat book if it were available for the Kindle.",1
"I do like m&eacute;nage books...however I much prefer when the female gets ALLLLL of the attention.  Yes, I am selfish that way.  That's my guilty pleasure when I read.  With that being said I was torn between a 4 or 5 star review.  So in fairness I went back and read the ARC again.  I was given a copy of this story in exchange for an honest review.  After my second read I decided on a 5 star review simply because this story has what it needs.  It's short, but you are introduced to the characters without feeling rushed.  You get enough background info on each so that it makes sense without any extra fluff.  There were a couple of odd sentences or typos but nothing that would make you regret the time it takes you to read this novella.",1
"Just could not get into it. Bought it, because the price was right. Still just not for me. Not to say you may enjoy.",0
I must say the author is talented.  The story line is easy to follow and has just enough color to make it interesting.  I am a fan of historical fiction and really like that I can not only look up unknown words but that via my Kindle I can even jump to wiki to research a topic or idea.  If this book continues to please me I plan on getting the others in the series.,1
"Acceptable character development, lacking some In the back story but reasonable development. It was easy to like the MCs, and the secondary ones were OK, though a longer tale could have filled them in more, too.",0
This is an utterly forgettable collection of lightly humorous editorials and blog posts about living as an expat in Spain.  None of the observations go beyond surface level.  It seems to exist mostly to promote the author's novel.,0

"Cliff Black's stories about the southwest Four Corner area are mesmerizing and toughly realistic. This area, filled with mysteries about the Ancient People is abundantly rich, with day to day real life struggles liberally sprinkled in.A myriad of thoughts torment the character's minds and the author cleverly burns nagging details into their psyches, details that refuse to leave.This is a beguiling mystery that turns a bit wild, stressing the protagonist, Daniel Corbin, just enough to gloss over his underlying paranoia.The reader can easily get enmeshed in local history, or enjoy being introduced to varied native tribal information.Black always presents well plotted tales that move at a good pace. And, Daniel Corbin proves to be a believable investigator.Many years ago, I too was attracted to test haunting mystic of The Ancient Ones, the Pueblo Indians and The Cliff Dwellers. This novel renewed that curiosity.The Trickster stories and the Coyote legends stir imaginations. The Jicarilla Apache background ties a connection cord between the reader and this area. The Four Corners weaves a magical spell to wind around, and strengthen, wavering minds which must confront deeply rooted fears. Maybe, just maybe, the family really was cursedThis novel is filled with deaths, corruption and devious plots. Excellent.",1
"First of all, I have no problem with menage relationships because one of my all time favorite books is ""Their One and Only"" by Trista Ann Michaels which I loved. Surprisingly, my problem with this book was not the length. However, one of my problems was that I thought that four men having one woman was just overkill. Problem number two being that two of the guys swing both ways but they called themselves family. That was just disgusting!I have no problem with gays, but the fact that one man is being done up his rear by the other while she's performing oral sex on him was just too much for me. That whole visual killed it for me. These are also the same men she heard getting busy up the hall after the first night they all ""shared"" her, so there was no guessing where his junk had been the night before, but she still eagerly put her mouth on him as if it was no big deal...I GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT!If that was not enough, as I previously mentioned, I think four men was way too many for this book. Four people just made the sex scenes more chaotic and scattered to me. It was hard for me to keep up with who was doing what to who, and who was enjoying who, because there was so much going on. Another disappointment, or should I say inconsistency in the story, for me anyway, was after Rayna finally has sex with Jaime for they first time. The two lovebirds actually make a pact that from that point forward he is the only one that will ""get her mouth"" but I guess that only included kissing which I thought was absolutely ludicrous seeing as how later that same day after he has ""claimed her mouth"" the first thing she does is give David, the guy being done by his boyfriend, oral sex. Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that claiming her mouth would include that as well. So, it was perfectly okay to suck them off, just not kiss them, that makes a lot of sense. THINK ABOUT IT AND GET BACK TO ME...You add all that up, and the fact that the whole insta-romance between Jaime and Rayna was just not believable in any way to me just made me not like this book at all, and I really wanted to. I could have cared less about Jaime being scarred and maimed. I just didn't believe there was a real connection happening while she was being banged by three other men. There was literally no time for a real relationship to blossom between those two.I guess I'll just have to count on Ms. Michaels to come save the day again because it seems like she's the only author that gets these menage relationships right on paper.",0
"I received a free copy of this book for review.There is something for every reader in this book. It was filled with action and adventure and the supernatural. At times, the novel reminded me of a mix of Indiana Jones and Stargate and, at other times, like supernatural stories of demons and ghosts.The characters were each distinct and there were many characters from different groups. At first, I didn't think I could keep track of them all, but each character developed his own persona as the book progressed and after a while it wasn't necessary to be told who was talking, from the natural-born leader, the Colonel, to the practical and knowledgeable policeman Murphy to the inexperienced novice Kate. This was true of the main group. Then, there were the baddies and the FBI. Some characters also had other names or variations on their names. Some sections were a little confusing and had to be re-read.The quest of finding a piece of the staff of Solomon was similar to finding clues in a good mystery novel. After reaching each one, the reader was anxious to read more. I found myself thinking about the story each time I laid the book down until I picked it up again, mostly trying to keep the characters and timeline straight.Different stories were weaved throughout the book from different times and different people as the story unfolded. Some sections of the story took place in a castle in the 16th century and others in the wild west with Frank and Jesse James while others were in modern times with a storyline of ritual killings. This presented no problem because the first paragraph provided enough clues that the reader knew who it was and what was going on, with the headings of the segment of the story being prefaced by the date. This was used as a mechanism to mete out all the information in spurts throughout the book, a way of showing how everything within the novel developed through time to the present day. It was a good technique and kept the reader from being overloaded with information.I prefer novels to have a definite conclusion, but this book is intended to be the first in a series and left the reader at a point where he or she wants to read the next book and the next or however many more there are until the story ends. As I said, if you like action and adventure, magic, ghosts, demons, quests and serials, you will enjoy this book.",1

"Vic Bayne is a PsyCop. He's the psychic half of a detective team assigned to special cases where certain types of paranormal activity may be at work. His boyfriend, Jacob, is also a PsyCop, but he's the non-psychic half of a separate detective team in a different precinct. Vic rates as a level five medium (the scale goes to seven), and he's able to easily hear and see the spirits of the deceased who have not moved on yet. He also has a tendency to abuse his medications, but hey, if you kept seeing murders reenacted, you would too.""Secrets"" is a great read. We delve deeper into Vic like we never have before. His relationship with Jacob is being strained by both internal and external forces. He's being pressured to have a house-warming for his new place, but since he and Jacob aren't officially ""out"" on the force, he starts to more closely contemplate he and Jacob can or will be perceived by their peers. Also, he's come to discover that there's very little information about him on the Internet. None, actually. Someone, or some group, is going through great lengths to erase any mention of him anywhere.The characters are deep and complex. Victor's narration is addictive and compelling (and wittily sarcastic throughout). Romantic encounters are charged with eroticism and passion. This book is a little different from the rest in that it doesn't have as conclusive an ending. The ending is the obvious jumping-off point of the next book in the series, ""Camp Hell"". Being enjoyable in of itself, ""Secrets"" also serves to build great momentum for the conclusion found in ""Camp Hell"", making the two novels combined an incredibly enjoyable and passionate experience. Jordan Castillo Price has a winner series on her hands with PsyCop.",1
"Although well-written with a fascinating hook, without reading Atwood's Surface first,  there's not much for me to connect with in this book. Bad on me - as it should be evident that reading Surface first was a must to get the most from this book. I gave it 4 stars because I felt it was incredibly well-done, well-written and thought-provoking. Now I just have to go back and read Atwood's book to get the most from this read.",1
I like reading science fiction and I did want to try reading science fiction erotica so this was my first attempt at reading anything like this.  I was not overly impressed or cared that much for this book.  The story and sample sounded interesting of a women geneticist Andrea and a doctor Roark being taken by somone named Mal Ton attempting to save his world I think that is what the story was supposed to be about and something I might like. Throughout the whole book it seemed that the story was just sex and there really wasn't a story involved.  I attempted to try to understand the story after rereading it but it was just a porno with no plot.  I think it would have been easier to just watch it on cinemax then read about it.,0
"Mostly what I liked about this book is the allegorical message. As far as characters, there isn't anything really new or amazing. The setting is interesting and the alliances for the upcoming war prove the author spent some time with world building.Most of the &#34;plot twists&#34; were easy for me to predict. This isn't unusual. I'm a writer and a voracious reader. If you can trick me and have the proper groundwork in place to back up your twist, I'm impressed.For me, the allegory is too plain here. It isn't preachy yet, but I suspect it might become that way before the series is finished. Of course, this makes me want to check out the next book to see if I'm right.While this first installment in the series does seem to have a story problem that is resolved (find the wielder) it isn't the main character's problem. His problem is feeling like an outcast in his home reality and I guess that is resolved in the story. It seems pretty easily resolved to me. The plot is strong for the story but the character arc is weak.If you like quests, magic, elves, dragons and battle scenes, you will probably enjoy this book. If you like fiction with a spiritual message, this book is for you. If you want amazing characters who grow and change; sorry, you can't always get everything you want.",1
"The story itself wasn't bad, but it was too short and the ending a bit of a disappointment. The author did a reasonable job with the wrap up but it just didn't fall together all too well. Not bad of a price tag for the content, though knocking an extra 50 cents off would have increased my rating. All in all not bad but too short.",0
"Was a little disappointed in this book.  To start it was way too short.  I was getting through it so quickly that I could not remember it was a sample or the actual book.  The author turned what could have been a great book and cut it down to an ""ok"" short story.  The end could have been jaw dropping if the author had taken us there properly.  In the end it was a good idea... but execution was lacking.",0
"The author writes a spy story around ""cute"" photos of his kittens.Mildly amusing concept but expanded way beyond what it could support.",0
"For recent converts to the Catholic faith this is a wonderfully fulfilling work.  It explains the differences, and the similarities, of the education of the older cradle-catholics.

"If you are always looking for captivating engaging books that will keep you absorbed and yet not end too fast, then both of the first two books of this series are a welcome treat.I actually found the first book to be the better of the two, perhaps more because the characters are great and there is a good solid mystery that is the focus of much of it.The second book had some great development, creative challenges, and overall action which keeps one reading all the way to the end and wanting more.There are about three things that hold me back from giving 5 stars:- no real oomph or focus for reflection after reading the entire books - these books are meant to be read just once- by the middle of the 2nd book you get the feeling that the story might be getting a little formulaic, or bogged down- While the characters are good here and change over time, I only give five stars to books that bring a little more out.So, at the prices, for the fun of reading, and for their length...these are definite buys but don't expect much more than that.  Solid 4 stars.",1
Not very well written but historical details interesting.,1
"There were a lot of interesting characters, in fact maybe too many. The ancillary characters were given a little too much significance, causing the need to bring too many pieces into the final closure. Just as a movie wouldn't seem real without the ""extras"", neither would a good book. However, when a clerk in a convenience  store says,""May I help you?"" in a movie, the director doesn't bring the clerks history into the movie. Ms Outroggeg gives far too much background on each person introduced and it leaves you rather confused at times. It also calls for some unbelievable endings to the assorted storylines. the main story was really good, but all the clutter sort of ruined the book for me.",0

I'd say that while these have thusfar been entertaining (taking up time and diverting my mind), there really just doesn't seem to be too much going on.  At least this one had a bit of action.

"I just love Bianca's heroes.  Love 'em!!!This is the 2nd book in the WereLords series.  I really enjoyed the first book where we also met Dante and Duncan for the first time.  Dante is the ultimate sexy good guy.  Megan is a part werewolf trying to ""work off"" an old family blood debt to clear her family's name and bring honor back to them, but got tricked in to giving her allegiance to the wrong people.  They in turn force her to do many questionable things.  Her supposed final task is to spy on Dante and find out what happened to a dark mage (enemy from the 1st book) and report back.  She and Dante fall in love and he and his good friend Duncan basically have to help undo the spells and compulsions that were put on her by the enemies, in order for them to move forward in their new relationship.  They also have to continue fighting against some ancient dark enemies that are striving to return to this world and take over.  All this while trying to figure out how the dynamics of their relationship will work, as in the past it's been forbidden...a Vampire mating with someone of ""her"" origins (can't spoil it by saying what they discover she is!!).  That's just a basic overview.  Lots of discoveries and fun details....read it~~I really appreciate when an author can bring two people together in a story early on and work out their ""secrets"" and ""misunderstandings"" right off the bat so they can continue as a team and fight the bad guys.  It saves so much angst in the whole process.  Readers don't always like to read the whole story of two peoples' suffering so they can get together in the last 5 pages of the book.  This book was fantastic!  Dante and Megan were a perfect match.  Both strong and independent while each equally able to trust and submit to the other.  Great fight scenes, as well as love scenes!  Powerful and realistic.  Loved it!!",1
"If I'm reviewing the author's writing style and creation of charact6ers, then this book gets 6 stars.

I'm tired, frankly, of wasting my time (and my money) on these things that are not even good &#34;short stories&#34; - but instead, attempts to rake in a few more publishing dollars.

"The premise of this book was interesting, cloning Jesus Christ.  The story the author wrote was an interesting one, but needed help in transitioning from one sub story to the next.  The reader was left wondering how two different stories intersected.  And just when you thought you understood what was happening, another sub plot was introduced.  While I enjoyed the book, I have to admit that it was one of the most difficult to follow",0
Not very good way too short and vague the writing seemed immature and not developed most of the book was Q@A with the author not even worth the free download.,0
"This novella is an extended prologue,  a sample of the writers work,  to entice you into buying the series.  I think it's a smart idea in principle,  to lure in uncertain browsers and give them a taste of what is to come.That being said,  this taste was enough for me.  I've read a lot of post apocalpytic fantasy,  and this wasn't bad by any means,  but it was completely average,  and did not stand out enough. This has a magic at it's core,  somehow some people have become imbued with spirit animals, and are working to establish new communities,  now that the government has appeared to fall a part completely. If you have not read many books on this topic,  this one may pull you in deeper,  but as I just finishedParable of the Sower,  which was both more powerful in content and in writing,  I'm giving this one a  pass.",0
another easy read in the series ejoyable One can learn quite a lot about the country and the peoples customs,1
I was expecting a whole lot more from this author as I have enjoyed her previous books.  This book was just too short and the characters were not developed enough.  Also I was expecting a christmas theme and the only part of christmas was that none of the characters celebrate christmas and so christmas day is just another day to them.  Hard to swallow that a con artist and a spy could immediately trust and fall into bed with each other and live happily ever after.  I was glad that I borrowed this instead of paid money for this as it was not worth either my time nor my money,0

"Jolene Benate has had to put her life completely back together over the last six years right after she was told her husband was dead.  Now she is a deputy marshal on an elite warrant team.  It's not been an easy road and Jo has succeeded, if you don't count the fact she can't move on from the love of her deceased husband.Paul Benate gave up Jo in a move he thought would prevent her from ever being harmed.  Paul has a brain that many would love to control and while he likes working for the military, he missed Jo every day these last six years.  When a report shows that Jo has been found and is a target, Paul demands to get back all he lost.When Jo and Paul meet again, the fireworks are many and pointed.  Jo is hurt and angry that she was lead to believe Paul was dead.  Paul wants to begin again, but first he has to convince Jo to both forgive him and to understand.  Love brought them together and drove them apart. Now when the danger to Jo seems to follow her, will love be enough to give Paul and Jo another chance?Still Mine has several of my favorite aspects in a story: hot sexy scenes, engaging main characters, and enough suspense that it makes you want to read quickly to find out the ending.  Jo has grown up and found a career even while loving the husband she believes is dead.  Paul made a decision he thought would save Jo from danger and was given a second chance.  From the moment they met face-to-face, I was drawn in and could not flip the pages fast enough.  Even before giving in to their passion, I could feel the strength of it.  I was quickly reminded that the emotions that give passion can produce equal fear and anger.  Watching Jo and Paul try and work out the past to hopefully lead to a new future for them showed me that a true and deep love never really dies.  When the danger comes from an unexpected angle, at least for me, I loved seeing the depth of the trust that had been restored between Paul and Jo.  Still Mine is equal parts hot romance and suspense, which I found not to be missed.  The cliffhanger ending leads me to hope that just maybe Jo and Paul will show up again soon in another book.Joreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1

"Okay, I realize that what turned me off this book is extremely subjective, all reviews are subjective, but I think some points are less subjective than others, however this is how I feel in good faith.Everybody has a different suspension of disbelief threshhold and believe in fantasy I can suspend disbelief as to a lot of things. Unfortunately I wanted to roll my eyes once I realized that yes, blurb was actually correct. And yes, I bought it because I was curious enough to see if I can suspend disbelief. So I cannot blame anybody but myselfSo, no spoilers, since  all I reference is the blurb which is here is for everybody to see, but seriously, Ryland dear, the only way you can get money for your tuition is to agree to be thrown to werelions? I mean, seriously, honestly, fantasy is great, but author chose to write about very human educational institution, right? Um, go get a loan, go work in construction on weekends, go do something. Sorry, I want realistic interactions even in fantasy, I cannot tolerate much stupidity.Anyway, if you CAN suspend disbelief and just tell yourself that this is what author chose to do to throw leads together, the story is actually well written and hot in my opinion and this is is why I give it three stars and not one. I just wish that initial setup would have worked better for me, even if he would have decided to do so for fun, because he was bored, that would have still been more believable for me, but not because he felt he had no other choice and nowhere else to get money.

"Nice story of what happens to Leslie after she leaves Huntsdale. I like that Irial and Niall are still watching over her and it was nice to have a little closure in their story. This is surely the oddest love triangle I've ever read about, though, and I'm not sure I find all the selflessness believable--especially in characters who are supposed to be so dark. But I enjoyed the story and found it better written and more convincing than the last book I read in this series,Fragile Eternity.",0

"I have downloaded this ebook a while back along with many others. Just now got to reading it. I just could not wrap my head around the first few pages! I love to read all types of stories, however this one confuses me from the start. The first person viewpoint is even more confusing. Hard for me to keep track on which is speaking and where it ends. I wouldn't mind a little bit more detail and especially the thrills except- there is only a crumble to none at all. I would have loved the author to make some changes, add some more descriptive and help us &#8211; the readers- identify who is actually talking and when. Also to show if it is a thought and not continued conversation &#8211; which if I had the actual book in hand- want to throw it to the wall.Linda caught cheating &#8211; then dies but is not &#8211; but the conversation &#8211; ugghhh so irritating to read from the get go. Once I am irritated- that is it.Overall, if you are the type of person who is rushed and loves to confuse everyone &#8211; then this one is for you. However, if you love a good story- I would have to suggest to pass this one up until the author re-edits this book to be more readable.",0

As usual her books are a good read and I enjoyed this one too. Her writing is great most of the time and worth rereading.,1
"Wyoming rancher Quinn McKay's been in love with his wife Libby for the past fourteen years.  They've been married for nine of those years and he couldn't imagine being with anyone else.  That's why their `trial separation' is proving to be the most difficult thing he's ever endured.He hopes that Libby will come to her senses and allow him to return to their home and her bed but it's become apparent to him that something has to change or he will lose her for good.  Quinn isn't one to talk about his feelings or show a lot of affection but after three months of separation he's willing to do whatever he has to in order to save his marriage.Libby McKay has never stopped loving Quinn but all the improvements she's made to herself and their home have gone unnoticed and she's afraid that the love and desire they once shared is gone forever.  She'd hoped that maybe a little time apart would rectify the situation but nothing she's doing seems to be enough to get him to fight for her.  It's a heartbreaking situation but it looks like divorce is imminent.Quinn does something completely unexpected and he reinforces the fact that he's staked his claim and lets her know that he has every intention of seeing that she gives him the second chance he deserves.  He even goes so far as to find new ways to show his feelings for her.  However, one of their biggest problems could simply be their lack of communication but maybe a weekend together could bring them closer than ever - especially if they're completely honest about everything that happened and what they desire from each other.Lorelei James' STRONG, SILENT TYPE really captures all the emotional angst that occurs when a marriage is in trouble.  What I especially enjoyed about this story is the genuine love that is evident in how Quinn and Libby respond to each other.  This is a relationship that deserves a second chance and really touched me because I can personally attest to the impact family interference and heartbreaking loss can have on a family and how much work it takes to keep your marriage from falling apart.  Lorelei James will touch readers' hearts with this memorable story which is not just very emotional - but also downright hot!  We all should be so lucky as to have a STRONG, SILENT TYPE man of our very own.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
"The whole premise of this story was pretty far fetched to begin with and the author just couldn't seem to get it together. The story felt disjointed and I honestly zoned out for several pages. Not to mention the whole paranormal aspect came out of left field for me, this could have been of course because I zoned out, but still it didn't fit for me. The writing was weak and the character development and story was pretty much non-existent, I get this is a short story but a decent writer can still create a complete story that flows in a limited amount of pages, and this author wrote a longer story than most naught nooners! Definitely not a story that left any sort of memorable impression, but it is free so read at your own risk.",0
"I picked this book up for free on Amazon. Cover props must be noted!I LOVE gargoyle books, and Stone Cold Lover is no exception. The hero is gorgeous, fierce, conflicted...and shows loyalty forged by a will of iron. The heroine, on the other hand, wasn't my favorite character. Her prolific promiscuity was a turnoff for me. Yes, she had her reasons, but they just didn't seem plausible enough for me. Others may not care. By the end of the book, she sort of redeemed herself though...or maybe I just wanted our hero to have his HEA. Either way, Stone-Cold Lover is a nice read.",0
"For centuries, the Prime have been battling their brutal enemies, the Antareans.  Facing extinction as they struggle against escalating Antarean attacks, the proud warrior race begins the process of uniting with the Galactic Alliance to ensure their future.Captain Wulf Caradoc, as the heir of the Prime leader, is expected to assist with negotiations on behalf of his people.  The secret, secondary part of his agenda is to look for his gemate, the genetically ideal mate that will be bonded to him mentally, physically and emotionally until the end of his days.  The ambassadorial team he is assigned to escort is attacked by space pirates hired by Prime malcontents.  Despite their skillful defense tactics, Wulf, his crew, and their charges are in danger until Alliance forces can reach them.Captain Melina Dmitros is a top-notch Galactic Alliance officer who's paid her dues.  After receiving a distress message from the Prime ambassador party, she steps in to aid them.  When she finally meets the future Prime leader face-to-face, she is ambushed by the biological force of the Prime mating urge.  She is his gemate, his fated match and a Lost One.  Her body will not allow her to survive without him, regardless of how she feels.  Wulf is willing to do whatever it takes to claim and protect his mate so that they may persevere against their enemies.The action kicks up a dust storm in chapter one of Prime Obsession that never settles!  I was convinced that Captain Dmitros was a first-rate adrenaline junkie from all the non-stop battles.  I rarely encounter a novel with multiple action scenes per interval.  Melina takes on bad guys, dodges hits, sniffs out/repairs sabotages, and keeps time with her man.  It's all in a day's work for a woman that knows her way around the Prime as well as the Galactic Alliance.  Wulf is growls and nibbles when it comes to his mate, although he's more than earned his formidable Prime warrior and sex machine title.  However, Melina is always center stage and in the thick of it all.  I started to feel that she was beginning to upstage her man.  Ok, ok.  Admittedly, I do prefer strong, accomplished female antagonists.  Still, Melina proved a bit overwhelming at times.Wulf's growling seemed uh, well...ridiculous after a while.  I've read novels with alpha males expressing their protectiveness this way, yet the constant repetitiveness became excessive and silly after a while.  Of course, it was a relief to have Wulf take charge after watching Melina prove just how tough and skilled she is over and over again. I could better appreciate the developing relationship.  The author does an amazing job of revealing the awakening gifts from a gemat-gemate pairing. Once I got a grasp on the dynamic, it was okay for the plot to charge ahead.Prime Obsession is a fast-paced space opera outfitted in shiny new gadgets and modern characters.  If you're looking for a sci-fi novel brimming with loads of techno jargon, intergalactic intrigue and angst, you've come to the right place.  Melina and Wulf's chemistry decimates small planets.  The ""foreplay"" preceding their first time together behind closed doors covers way too much ground; it dangled on the storyline string a tad longer than I would have preferred.  The romance and dialogue occasionally feels dated, although I could appreciate some truly cute moments.  Monette Michaels' narrative style is clean and precise with crisp visuals that flow easily from scene to scene.  All in all, it's fun to be kept on the edge of your seat for the bulk of the ride.  That's no easy feat in a story with so many subplots and secondary characters.  If this is just the first installment, then the next episode will have to put in some major overtime to keep up.PatriceReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
I got this as a freebie on Kindle. Having never read this series  was a shocker for me. I mean where the heck have I been??!! Masterfully written. The characters are very intriguing as I watched them grown separately  and then together. I will be recommending this book as well as getting all of this series in Kindle Form!,1
I bought this book because of all the five star reviews.  I think they may have come from the author's family and friends.  This book was just so-so at best.  The first half of the book was actually boring with little action.  Most of the book consisted of the main character wondering if what he was thinking and experiencing was real or was it due to his paranoid schizophrenia that had surfaced after 22 years under control.  Was someone really trying to drive him insane or was that just his paranoia?  There were some good points in the plot but not enough to make a good book.  Fortunately it was a quick read and the Kindle formatting was generally good.,0
"With all the others books available, this one just doesn't hold up.  A good read, yes, but not a rivetting one.",1
"I thought this was a good story with a lot of potential,but felt like it ended just as it was getting good.  There were enough characters and potential plot lines for it to have gone at least twice as long if not more.",1
"OMG, WTF and all the other  short hand language that is used to say no. I truly hate not finishing a book but in this case I'm ok with it. The names are wacky, the language is difficult plus the start of the book is dry. This book was drier than my sister -in-law's turkey and she cooked it for 12 hours (poor bird).  If you need something to put you to sleep then this book is just what you need.",0
"I really liked this book, there was a lot of excitement and action. It was a different kind of story but very good.",1
The book did not flow well. Slow getting to the point and the authors attempt to make the characters sound Scottish was terrible. Don't waste your money on this one.,0
"like the idea, but some of the stuff in this book is just gross.  and I didn't need to see pictures of it.",0
"I nearly didn't buy this book because at least two reviewers said the heroine was annoying. One quoted the heroine saying the room felt ""embarrassed"" because of a minor imperfection in the flooring. I thought that sounded quirky and since I'm known to be a little quirky myself, I decided to give the book a try. I'm glad I did.The story is well-written and entertaining. For the first time in a romance story I got irritated by the make-out/sex scenes because they were interrupting the story and I wanted to see what would happen next! Even though it was quite obvious to me who the villain was, I still wanted to know how the person would be discovered and what the consequences would be. I was a little impatient with the characters--especially Ellis--for being unable to guess the person's identity, but I guess Ellis has a blind spot as she likes to believe the best of others.The unmasking of the villain turned out to be a bit of an anti-climax, though. When incidents escalate, the police are called in, but we are never clued into what is going on with the investigation. One day the police are interviewing our hero and heroine, then a week or so later, the police turn up and arrest the villian and cart the person off the premises. We are not even allowed a glimpse of the arrest scene, so there just didn't seem to be a strong enough resolution to the whole mystery, even though we know who did it and why it was done.As for the romance between Simon and Ellis, it was satisfying to me. I thought she was a little eccentric where her work was concerned, and a bit of a perfectionist, but not unreasonably demanding. Simon's a hard-working guy who takes pride in the work his company does, and he recognises that same element in Ellie. So, while he may get exasperated with Ellie's requests, he doesn't hold them against her. The two of them fit together quite well. I thought the author was going to get Simon to meet Ellis' family, since Ellis' mother was mentioned, but that didn't happen. A pity, because it would have been great to see them get together outside, away from the whole construction/interior decorator setting. I do agree with another reviewer that Simon shouldn't have flirted with Cynthia but I think he wasn't sure how to extricate himself from her when she cornered him--and being that I'm a woman and I've seen how some women can be, I can find it in myself to feel a little sorry for the poor guy!Overall, I liked the story a lot and I would read other works by this author.",1
"Was not what I had really expected, but it kept me reading right to the end.  Have now read another in the series and both were well written.  You feel these characters and there passion.",1
"Well written, informative, not US-Europe centered. It lets me know whats REALLY going on.If you're in business, you need to read this paper. Couple it with the AP Blog and youre good to go.I hope with the kindle 2 they start to add pictures here and there...Happy Reading!",1
This was a difficult read.  It was much like the Nazi death camps in War and Remembrance.. A long slog through misery and hate.,0
Hot scenes of a grownup virgin woman that is put in a dungeon with a man/beast for one night. Taming it and resulting the next morning that they stay the rest of their lives together. Without knowing each other or any other dialogues. 4 dl is way to much money 0.99 or free sounds more interesting.,0

"This book was fun to read. If you like military sci fi you won't go wrong. What I really liked about the book is the ""find"". I don't want to spoil it for other readers so I won't say any more. I only wish the book was longer and had a lot more story and background for this find. The core is there for this book to be great!  Maybe we could see a prequel?",1
"This was a pretty good, enjoyable introduction to the Werewolves of Malta series. We dived right in to the potential mating between Bruno and Renee. Bruno is an alpha who knows what he wants who recognizes the power that Renee holds. He knows that a mating between them could bring their Pack power but he has to challenge the current Pack leader. Renee has been burned by alphas before; her father is trying to sell her to an older mate so she's reluctant to believe that Bruno wants to become mates. There is an undeniable spark between them that draws them together and heat when they finally come together. I had only a few issues with this story. Again, I felt it was a little short; there was a lot of potential for a longer story. I also wasn't that big of a fan of the fact that Renee was only 20. Maybe it's because I'm getting older but I'm typically not drawn to heroines that are that young. Other than that, good read!",0
"And this was the third and probably last book I have read by this writer.  I have to disagree with another reviewer that it was an unusual story unfortunately. It was definitely well written, but I would call it extremely typical and annoyingly repetitive story for this writer.Once again the romance revolves around the extreme growth of one character and another character going down a few inches. Once again the character who is growing obsesses over the smaller character and once again smaller character is oblivious as to how charming and charismatic he is that everybody wants him.This writer certainly knows how to write and how to write well, but based on the three books from her that I have read in rather short period of time (I usually tend to seek more books from this writer if I loved one book so it is nothing unusual) I find myself quite bored.",0
"In a world without magic, magic comes alive again and strange creatures are sighted that have lived only in legends.Delvers live along side of humans and are the only different race left from the times of magic. That is what humans and delvers thought.Ryson Acumen is a purebred delver, creatures of intense curiosity and speed of movement, and he is traveling to discover the cause of an unexplained disturbance of the land. During the beginning of his travels Ryson encounters a zombie that tries to kill him and an elf who befriends him. There are more races to meet and there is a quest... to race against more magic being released in the world.This first book of a trilogy builds a believable world and the action increases as the book moves along.Because the book started off as a slow read for me, I gave only gave it 4 stars. The last half of the book was worthy of a 5 star book and I'm looking forward to the next book in the trilogy, hoping it will be a true 5 star all the way from start to finish.I enjoyed the book and the characters and the action. If you like fantasy and action and epic adventure stories, you'll like this book.",1
The author was great at building an interesting world but... I  did not know and was given no back story on these mythical gods. Which was only mildly irritating. What ruined the book for me was the meet the guy for minutes and have the heroine have graphic sex.  There was no relationship building.  The same can be said of the characters themselves they reflected Th same shallowness of interaction all the more disappointing because there are glimmers of real  talent and intellect in this author  I won't be reading any more of her work it was too disappointing,0
"What a fun read.  A couple of Geek theoretical physicists look through the wrong end of a radio telescope and discover  ---  a universe full of people!  A funny book that doesn't take itself too seriously -- OK, doesn't take itself at all seriously, and if you are a big sci fi fan, you will love this mini vacation from the deadly serious alien military invasions.  Just a great read.",1
Amazing cakes I don't think so I think there should be more girl cakes and less boy cakes that is why I gave it 1star,0
"Too many lazy shortcuts in this book.  It seems like the author didn't want to have to think about the characters--so she picked out a bunch of stereotypes.  Item one: two nasty sisters squabbling with each other constantly about who's hotter.  Item two:  every member of the large family agreeably leaping into their assigned role, which is even listed in case we're too stupid to figure it out.  Item Three: the Irish mom who reads the minds of her 30-year-old daughters and everyone else. And of course Item Four:  ""mysteries"" cropping up that don't get resolved, probably to sucker you into buying the next installment (btw:  no chance!). If you can get past all that, you arrive at the heart of this book, which is . . . well, I'm not sure there is a heart.Ugh.  I am a fan of light-hearted escapist fiction, but this was more light-headed.  As in brainless.",0
"This book was such a great bit of enjoyment, that I immediately went to buy the sequel. Note to the author, the Amazon link to the sequel in the back of your book makes it EASY to spend a little $$ on another title of yours. Thank you.There was just enough adventure, drama, and fun tempered with a bit of wit and sarcasm, to make this book really enjoyable. A real easy read, the author created a fun universe with enough simple giggles to make the book hard to put down. I really did not want the story to end so soon, and was relieved to find a sequel already out.The book is artfully crafted and a joy to read.",1
"A case of two souls finding direction when they found each other.A fun story, well rounded characters. Love comes and stays.",1
"The Kindle version of ""The New Yorker"" looks great and is easy to navigate.  No, you don't get all of the cartoons from the print version, but you get a nice handful of them- accessed via clicking on the cartoonists' names at the end of the Articles List.  I was going to complain that the print version's cover (one of the most notable aspects of the magazine) isn't included in the Kindle version, but it is.  After a bit of investigation, I discovered that if you simply hit the previous page button after you're sent to the first page of the Articles List- voila!- you're shown the cover.  Don't know why they're being so cagey about it, but at least it's there.  Monthly subscription price is very good, too.  For the price I'm paying for each monthly issue of ""Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine"" on the Kindle, I'm getting four (and sometimes even five) full issues of ""The New Yorker"".  This was an easy buying decision.2/17/09 postscript: I see from my new issue of ""The New Yorker"" that they somewhat corrected the cover problem.  You're still not sent to the cover when you first open your new issue, but at least they're more clear that it's there. On the first page of the Articles List- the place you're still sent upon first opening your issue- there's now an entry for ""Cover"", which also helpfully includes the name of the artist who drew that week's cover, along with the title of the cover art.  Just click on the cover info and you're sent to the cover.  Or, as said before, you can still just hit the previous page button from the first page of the Articles List to get there, too.3/3/09 postscript (the final one, I promise):  Another new issue, another change.  This time, when I opened my newest issue (my first on my new Kindle 2), the first thing I saw was indeed the cover, so there you have it.  No selecting or clicking to see what by all rights SHOULD be the first thing one sees upon opening ""The New Yorker"".  Though (grumble) the cover is reproduced a little small, underneath the needless redundancy of the magazine's title floating above the magazine cover (redundant because the title is right there within the cover reproduction).  Whatever.  It's petty to quibble.Anyway, chalk up this silly review, with its endless updates, to the fact that Amazon and its participating magazines continually tweak Kindle content to improve their readers' experiences.  And they mostly succeed.By the way, ""The New Yorker"" looked and worked great on the first Kindle and- with more elegance and more functionality- everything is even better on the K2.",1

Marc has always been a no strings attached guy, and Jodi has a history of men hurting her emotionally.

"My question is, what happened?? The incident with the connection and trying to find her I was like holy cow this is getting gd even thou it took some time to get the book going and then it was blah. How? You were going so gd! I stopped at 32% in hopes that it would pick up again but I just couldn't continue. I might pick it up in the future because so many people couldn't be so hooked when I seem to have slipped off... Oh well, I guess it wasn't my cup of tea. Won't discourage anyone and come on..it's FREE. Gd read for those that want anything mildly interesting to read.",0
"**warning*** this review has some spoilersIt's not just the characters who are frustrated throughout the book, it was myself as well.I had high hopes for the story line, it was a novel approach and I enjoyed reading a romance from this time period set in Bath rather than in London. The main characters are engaging and the writing style is well done. But then the frustrations start.First of all,  Lady Iona is downright awful at anything approaching communication. She lets her family shut her up all the time, even when her very happiness depends on it. And then she constantly thinks about telling Nathan the truth about her father's plan to engage her to her cousin, but she never actually brings it up. It takes her forever to explain to him why she won't marry him. And then once he insists on the marriage, even after he's told her how impressed he is with her artwork and how he'll support her in the endeavor, she immediately starts assuming that he'll crush the happiness out of her and not let her do the things she wants to do. I have NO idea where she got that idea, and she never even asks him about it! I'm not really sure who she was rebelling against... it mostly seemed to be like she was rebelling against her assumptions rather than what people actually wanted/expected from her.Not that Nathan's much better at communication, but at least he tries to talk to HER even if he doesn't clear up things with his family - not that they're listening to him anyway.She's also more than a little bit selfish, but even once she realizes that she's behaving selfishly, she doesn't stop! And she behaves more than a little recklessly, putting herself in danger in ways that IF she truly had spent time helping women of the lower classes like she says she does, then she would know better. I understand wanting to make her seem innocent and naive, but in a lot of the situations she goes way too far and it just becomes ludicrous.And then we have the ridiculous about turn of her family.  Not only did her mother warn off Nathan from her - long before he had truly become a rake, and we never get a real explanation for that... unless the rumor about him ruining another girl was out beforehand? but even then, why would the DUCHESS be the one visiting and telling him that, shouldn't it be up to Iona's father? - but her father goes from punching Nathan in the face one night and insisting that she must marry her cousin as he's planned, to the next morning hearing Nathan out and then declaring that Iona must marry Nathan to save HIS reputation? Why on earth does her father suddenly believe Nathan's accounting of events? Out of freaking NOWHERE?!There is a good story within this book, unfortunately it's hampered by way too many obstacles which bog down the plot line, an overabundance of bad communication between characters (to the point where I almost put the book down because they were annoying me so much with their ridiculousness), and ludicrous turn-arounds from several of the side characters who suddenly start behaving supportive without any explained motivation. That being said; I did adore Lord Nathan and the end of his story was immensely satisfying. I just wish that Lady Iona and her family hadn't been so ridiculously eye-roll worthy.",0

"Jules Verne's Guide to Survival. I enjoyed the adventure. This is one classic you don't want to miss. Not only is it fun to read, but you might learn something as well.

"I just finished this book -- I read it all in one day because I could not put it down. What an amazing first book for this new author!! Bravo Eric!!The story is fast-paced, never stopping. The main character, Argus, is immediately likeable which I found strange because he is a troubled paranoid schizophrenic. Throughout the story you are kept guessing because you are not sure what is real and what has been imagined from that tormented mind -- it gives you a glimpse into the mind of someone who suffers from this.The plot moves fast, right from the beginning, and the story keeps you guessing ""who dunnit"" until the end.For this price, you are getting MORE than you deserve in terms of entertainment value.I am keeping Eric Christopherson on my radar for future novels.",1

The Mysterious Island is the 1st time I have read Jules Verne. Of course I've known about him all my years alive since my teenage years and have to say I really did enjoy this book which I downloaded free from Amazon for my Kindle being one of the classics that it is.

"I really like this book. Ms. Marinelli has a good ability to grasp her readers with just enough detail, not too much. This novel is a good glimpse of hope and second chances with one's spouse.  But, I have a couple of critiques.First of all, Ms. Marinelli seems to forget, like a lot of modern romance novelists, that her readers have an imagination of their own. It is my humble opinion that people who love to read are also very creative, imaginative and inventive.  As a result, they only need to be guided and engaged, but left to piece the obvious themselves.  I specifically refer to the scenes that only a spouse and a wife should be a part of. Its cliche and annoying to encounter the unnecessary descriptions of these scenes in a book such as this one.This book is really beautifully written and throwing in a piece of what Hollywood claims sells only cheapens things.  There is a beauty in leaving some things to the imagination.  I challenge Ms. Marinelli to be different.  She is an amazing writer.  I challenge her to believe in her skills as a writer and protest the status quo of cheap romance novels.Secondly, I also challenge her to look into a faith in God that she may be holding back.  It seems she was tempted to attribute the 'coincidental' occurences in the book to Him, but she held herself back by only saying 'someone' was looking out for the main characters.  Of the couple times that she mentions God by name, one is at a moment to blame Him for what 'went wrong' and another is to reduce Him to a buffet style God that one can pull apart for the pieces that are convenient to us.  And with this again, I challenge her to be different.Believe it or not, for as many people who read romance novels for the 'steamy' scenes, there are that many more who read them for hope in something more.  For some the belief that love is possible, for others that there is hope after difficulties and for others perhaps a good and clean escape.  Maybe your temptation to include God is not a mere coincidence as He does lead to good and hope filled love.I truly loved this book and only gave it one star away from perfect because I choose not to share it with others for the first reason I mentioned above.  I found myself having to skip those pages getting an idea of what was coming.  I do appreciate the warning at least.  But, call it pruddish or whatever else you may but I still believe in there being a lot more said when sometimes nothing is said at all but instead just understood.",1
"As I say in the title, I'm new to Analog having subscribed to it only by Kindle. I'm loving it. I had no idea the Kindle version was more expensive than the print version. While I find this curious, I don't have a preexisting view of a fair price for this magazine. As such, I think the $2.99 per month with instant delivery to a much more pleasant reading format (Kindly versus paper), I'm pretty happy.My delight in Analog is a credit both to the magazine and to the Kindle. I'm thoroughly loving this.",1
"This story was phenomenal.  I didn't know what to expect going into this story.  For some reason I thought this book was about something else, but in any event I loved it.  In a nutshell Lila agrees to be Hunters mistress in order to save her father's business.  Hunter propositions her because he had been disfigured due to an accident and doesn't think he can get female companionship without making them some type of deal.  Lila thinks she hates him because in order to save her father's business she has to bend to his will.  She's ashamed of her circumstances but can't deny she enjoys the things that he does to her body.  Hunter is always in control when it comes to there love making.  It's however and whenever he says.  The sex scenes are INCREDIBLE!!!  Hunter and Lila eventually fall in love and get their happily ever after. Definitely 5 stars!!!",1
"This one was my least favorite, I was so scared the author was gonna follow the same protocol of the cut and run series and ruin my life in the process.Jealousy and cheating are so not appealing to me. I have hated Crash since he first appeared exactly because of how much he threatens the whole story. And seeing Jacob doing what he did in this book made me hate him with a passion. I didn't think him and Crash were all that friendly towards each other anyway.Our Vic is acting like a brat too, trying to control other peoples lives. More specifically: Lisa. The infamous lisa who disappeared on us and now wants to be a part of the story once again. Make up your mind!The plot was pretty solid though just when I think I've seen creepy this writer shows something even creepier.And the boys are so busy with the new loft and work too. But going strong.",1

"Ms. Kennedy I want to let you know how much I have enjoyed your series, but could it be notated in a more prominent way, so we all can start at the beginning?",1
"There is a lot of jumping around - which I don't mind if it ends up pulled together.  Much did not.  This was more stream of consciousness writing and did not flow real well or in cogent manner plot wise.  Perhaps some of that is genre related (I can admit - noir is not my normal bag) .There are a lot of editing issues (missed words /punctuation) .  The randomness without back story of the characters lets much hang.  Description without fleshing out of characters was also disappointing.  Although (I have said this before) some may be related to length and it being prohibitive to such.  I just find it frustrating when there is real meat to a story, but it just ends without going through the paces set forth initially.  There is so much potential for this were it run through its paces as a full novel (or even novella) .  This felt (as I read) unique voicewise and plotwise.  It just never delivered - even becoming predictible in some parts.  There were just too many plot devices started and /or hinted at without development.I would have rated one star for reasons stated above - the save was the wry voice of the writer - which garnered two stars alone.Not recommended if you are a reader for whom pacing and story completion (other than with just ""there done because I end it here "") are important.  Recommended if you are looking for something different to read from a writer with a good voice.  I would try another from this author provided it is a bit longer to ensure (hopefully) full story development.  The writer has the goods - just needs to show the stamina.Cbristine",0
This book was riveting and I couldn't tear my eyes away from it! It seduced me from beginning to end. It's a great read and is very well written. I loved it. I plan on buying all of the book in the series. But a warning to those who don't like explicit and graphic sex scenes I wouldn't read this.,1
"Oh my gosh, this is the totally awesome story of how I found out I was a demon (well, actually a beautiful fairy) with super-cool powers who is actually the key to the future of fairies and maybe the world!  I was in school to learn how to fight demons, but fortunately I didn't pay much attention, so everybody I meet in the fairy world has to spend tons of time explaining fairy powers and society to me.  And I get my very own fairy-boy!  We're like, fated, to be together . . . at least until I get my vampire-boy!  Now that I'm a fairy, I'll do whatever I want!  I'll sneak vampires into my dorm room despite the fact that they eat humans and I totally live with a bunch of humans!  I'll make out with my fairy-boy and then I'll make out with my vampire-boy.  There's a whole fairy society and stuff, but that doesn't matter, because I make my own rules!  Rules are for losers who aren't very important fairies.Did I mention that I'm beautiful and I have tons of powers that nobody else has and I am in love with a fairy AND a vampire?  In case you didn't get it, I'll refer to my fairy-boy and my vampire-boy a few more times.  Check out the sequels where I'm sure to break some more rules, uncover more unprecedented powers that only I have, and be with two guys while I try to figure out which one of them I really want - the fairy-boy I have an inexplicable, instant, and powerful bond with or the vampire-boy I have an inexplicable, instant, and powerful bond with!",0
"Unless I misunderstood something, the ending was confusing and had a bad conclusion - I hate that in books, there are enough bad endings in real life without having to read about them for entertainment.That being said, the story was told well, kept my interest and the author is to be complemented - for all but the ending.",0

"I like Desiree Holt, so I actually bought this book before it was offered for free and I didn't think I wasted my money.  I enjoyed it for what it is, a short vignette with paranormal overtones that speaks to women's fantasies.  Heck it's free, give it a try and then you can try some more of this prolific authors stories.",1

"Book 1 of Bell's ""Halle Pumas"" series. Followed bySweet Dreams.Books 1 to 3 are available as a paperback anthologyMating Games.Plot:Max and Emma are Mates. Once Max explains the whole ""changing into a puma"" thing, convinces the pride to accept her, and gets the annoying ex off his back, they might even get their HEA.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting) SmallTown romance with explicit bedroom scenes.- 2340 kindle locations, 25,979 words, but finishes around 1739 locations.- m/f - explicit, reasonably frequent. Includes a caring and sweet de-flowering.- Emma is a ""larger"" woman and has some insecurities associated with that (but not too many).

At the end of the day, it makes me smile. Bell gives a wicked humour to her characters, as well as lots of hot sex and a different take on shifters (our main characters are *human* before pumas, and have a human life, job, loves, friends). Okay, Max and Emma getting together was somewhat sudden, and she wasn't exactly given a choice with the whole shifting, but I'm willing to suspend my disbelief and just *believe*.4.5 stars rounded up. It's short, and I wanted a little more story, but it works.""The Ornament Book1"":2 months later and it's their first Christmas together. When Max hangs lights on the house so ""the space shuttle could land safely on [the] driveway"" Emma really hopes there's more to her Christmas surprise than that.A happy erotic short story (just a few pages) available free from Bell's website, that gives us a sweet epilogue to Emma and Max's story.

"I didn't hate it, but it's far from the best book I'll read this year.  The premise is interesting, but the book itself is big on plot and slow on action.  The way they figure out where the big bad is in the end is kind of silly.",0

"Dylan and Sasha are two wounded souls who feel out of place at Red Rock. Dylan is surrounded by alpha males and females and feel as though he doesn't contribute anything to his new pack. Even though he killed Alan Matthews, he continues to feel guilty about putting Abigail and Brynn and the people of Red Rock in harms way. Sasha is a witch. Werewolves and witches have a long history and do not trust each other. Even though Sasha helps defeat Alan Matthews and his pack, the people of Red Rock still don't trust her.I loved the relationship between Dylan and Sasha. They both saw themselves as a hindrance to people where in fact, they were both a great help. Dylan isn't an alpha male but his protective instincts kick into gear when he's around Sasha. The attraction is mutual and they get to explore that attraction when they are sent on assignment by their Alpha Gavin. Dylan is very careful not to do anything that would scare Sasha. Sasha is stronger than he thinks. Maybe a little skittish considering what she's been through, but definitely strong.Sanctuary's Price is a good read. I think this may be my favorite book out of the series only because you see the natural progression of Dylan and Sasha's relationship starting with the first book. Dylan is sensitive without being wimpy and Sasha is scared and vulnerable without being whiney.",0

I actually read pt2 before this one cause I didn't know there was a prequel. I must say this one is pretty good. At least now I understand the story better. But do people in New York really say all that &#34;peace god&#34; and things like that? LOL it's throughout both books! It's something that a woman wrote this and has all the knowledge to make the story realistic. That's boss right there!,1
"Read one book by this author that I loved, unfortunately this did not live up to it.  Not much depth to the story and very short for the money",0
I thought this was a novel. I usually love Ross McDonald but this wasn't one of his best. I would have got something else.,0
The movie prompted me to buy the book which I found quite engrossing for the first half.  I managed to read on for about a qrt of the 2nd half then gave up as the story theme became repetative.  A younger reader would most probably stay with it to the end.,0
"Was cute and funny, but definitely only 166 pages.  I normally don't ever read short stories cause they seem false with no story lone.",0

"I bought this to read before I saw the movie.  It can be tedious because our language has changed so much.  The way the female characters are portrayed is indicative of the period in which the novels were written.

what a wonderful collection of full length books. I loved every one of them. They were all unique vampire stories.,1
This is an enjoyable erotic dragon world which I will be happy to revisit.  The characters are all very likable but the dragons who mind link and share pleasure with their knights are especially so.  The writing lags in places and the heroine is a bit vapid as is the hero. There just isn't a lot of depth here but the sexy times are well done and with fun twists.,0
"The Thinking Machine is--well--mechanical. Talk about formulaic writing! Professor Van Dusen (AKA The Thinking Machine) is an insufferable bore. The police are always too dumb to figure things out. Van Dusen recites to them (in EVERY SINGLE STORY) ""two and two make four. Not sometimes but all the time."" Ah, logic triumphs over all!If you are looking for character development, you won't find it here. The professor is unidimensional and not the least bit endearing. His dimwitted sidekick, Hatch, is always two or three steps behind. The book did have one redeeming quality--it a great help when I had a hard time falling asleep. A few pages and I would be out like a light!  And since the whole thing was summed up in the last couple of pages, you could just cut to the chase and save yourself a lot of time.If you want a good read, try Agatha Cristie (almost ANYTHING she's written), or if you like a hint of the egotistical devotee of logic, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is a better choice--hands down!",0
"Enjoyed this story even though it was a short one. Perhaps it's because I'm a sucker for stories where something physical happens to either the H or h, which makes them realize how much they love each other and eventually brings them together.

"No value here for readers. I am aiming my one star to average this book lower. I would not even bother with a review, except that this is a total waste of kindle space...and I am a reader.

This was so boring I had to quit reading it - something I almost NEVER do.  It seemed to go on and on and on and I wasn't making any headway with the story. Felt like I had been reading for days and couldn't get beyond the 20% mark.  Really a disapointment!,0

"Ugh, not sure where to start. I am a sucker for these types of stories... someone goes through hell, or has a tormented past and has someone or meets someone to help them overcome... ending in love! But I found this book making me angry, I found the characters unbelievable, mainly on how they talked and how their conversations went. I think someone else commented on that also, which almost made me not give this book a chance... but I did anyway. I think another thing that made me angry was, I am *****POSSIBLE SPOILER****** not a fan of D/s and that's where it all led too and for it to be used to help overcome someones hell of being kidnapped and tortured... sexually and mentally... yeah, didn't set to well with me. And if I read or hear someone refer to someone else as 'my boy' I think I will lose my lunch... really? Does anyone really say that? The term was slightly over used. I so wanted to like this book, but I am sad to say I didn't, sure it kept me reading, to find out what would happen, but when I realized it was headed to where I was hoping it wouldn't... it just left me disappointed.",0
"I enjoyed the book; however, the book is written for younger/tween readers.  The book will not scare the living daylights out of one, but gently bring one into the realm of mysteries.  This is a good book to read on a camping trip sitting around the bonfire, dark nights of thunder and lightening, a sleepover.  Will not cause scary dreams!",0

Not terrible, and if you like Jules Verne this is pretty representative of his work.",0
"RENECADE by Cameron Dane.Personally, I found myself skimming the sex scenes.  I prefer more emphasis on characters and plot.The story line was ok, but it could have been better.  The main conflict is that Cade would not forgive something Ren did.  What Ren did was stupid, but he did have some justification.  He misunderstood Cade's actions.  I was confused by Cade's actions.  Then Cade held his grudge for an excessively long time.  But there is a happy ending.A secondary story involved someone vandalizing property.  That person's motives, methods, and actions were not shown.  I would have liked more about that.A minor problem: too many characters's names started with C.  It took energy to keep them straight: Cade, Caleb, Cain, Connor, and Crash.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person.  Kindle count story length: 8,290 (619 KB).

i have now read a few books by this author and find them all good reads. You will enjoy the series,1
"It's an oldie but a goodie. That's what I like to say about books that are written so long ago and yet they still remain relevant and entertaining. A Journey to the Centre of the Earth is no exception. While the original publication goes back to 1864, it is a fun romp nonetheless. It should be noted that, over the years, different translations of the book have been made. This version from Amazon comes at the low, low cost of free. One notable difference between this translation and the original is that the name of one of the main characters is changed. But these things are trivial, as the story of a professor, his nephew, and a loyal guide is entertaining the whole way through.The Good: There were a few things I really liked about this book. First, the adventure. The excursion into the unknown was fascinating. Nevermind that what happens in the book could never actually be real; when you are reading the story you imagine that it is. You feel the danger and suspense as the three explorers go deeper into the earth and discover many fascinating things. Also, I found it interesting that the story is written as if it is an actual, educational account. Throughout the entirety of the book, the narrative explains the meaning of certain scientific terms and past discoveries that are relatable to what the explorers see and experience. It certainly is a fun journey to follow them as they make their way to the center of the earth!The Bad: One problem with a book that is so old is the terminology and phrasing. There are many words and phrases used that we just don't use today. At times, I had some trouble understanding exactly what was being described or talked about. For instance, on more than one occasion it mentions how the explorers stopped to have ""repast"". This isn't a term most would use today, and it simply means they stopped to eat or have a meal. Also, the pacing in the beginning is a little slow, and the real fun of the adventure does not begin until about a third of the way through the book.The Ugly: This one is not really a fault of the book, after all, I have to take the time period it was written in into account. This book has seen a few adaptations in the film industry. The result is that I was expecting some of the things I have seen in the movies. Despite all the wonderful things seen on their journey, all of what they see is plausible for the time period written. Instead of finding areas with lack of gravity or floating rocks, the explorers happen upon a world stuck in the far past, thousands of years before their journey. All of it, in a sense, was real at one point. Many of the movies today depict things that have never happened in the earth's history, and fantastical things that it will probably never see either. If you are expecting an account following what has been shown in film, you may be disappointed.Overall, I really liked A Journey to the Centre of the Earth. It was fun to see into the past in more way than one and appreciate the perspective of a science fiction writer from a century and a half ago. I highly recommend you read this, if you haven't already. This is classic science fiction. Like I said at the beginning, it's an oldie but a goodie.",1
Endless chatter.  Unresolved plot points.  Not remotely entertaining.  The rambling narrative was annoying and served no purpose other than to make it a challenge to finish the story.,0

I really like Jennifer Crusie's writing and have enjoyed several of her books.  Her sense of humor is wonderful and refreshing.,1
This was a sexy new twist to the age old story of beauty and the beast. Each character was nicely done and the story moved at a fast well written pace.,1
"Fantastic!  If you like the other books, you'll love this one!  Just the right balance of adventure and sexual tension to keep those pages flipping.",1
"I think I would have really liked this book had it not been the descriptions of size for the male lead.  I mean c'mon!!!!  There really is such a thing as 'too big' and this is up there with HELL NO!  Every time I started to get back into the story and care about the characters here comes another description of 'the cannon'.  It just got to be utterly ridiculous!  And EVERY male is of that proportion?  Not to repeat myself but really, ridiculous!",0
"This is a review of the three books that currently comprise this series so please apply to all of them.First, If I could have  I would have rated this series at 3.5 stars, rounding down I gave it three but it is worth reading if you like the military science fiction genre. If it had better characterization and editing I might have given it four stars. The writer may be a new author? My recommendation is to buy the trilogy which is available as single download.There are some very creative elements in these books as far as tactics and political structure goes, but there are some real leaps of faith around the structure of the formation of a global response here on Earth.This is old fashioned science fiction where one man and heroic effort by a team of no nonsense military men deliver nearly impossible results in next to no time. You will read some political posturing based on today's situation and you may be tempted to stereotype the authors political views but don't be too quick to judge.Now the story, it is a fast based space opera with elements of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the beautiful alien princess and archaic code of honor, E.E. Smith, the rapacious and clearly evil alien races (no, not as bad as the Chlorans or Boskone) but it is easy to identify the villains, both aliens and humans and often the human villains come across as worse than theThe hero is one Alexander Thorson, an ex-NFL player, ex-Air Force pilot and actually an ex-lots of things. Alexander is blessed with the physical capabilities of an older NFL player and a unique view of tactics, inter-species psychology as well as an interesting fount of experience.The first book introduces us to Alexander as a victim, a captive of aliens right out of Area 51 and his unique approach and quick thinking in this circumstance and the further adventures he has with other aliens sets the stage for the entire series of three books. Lots of battles, personal hardships overcome, a love story, bad aliens and crooked Terran's to overcome,  what more do you want?",0

"""I'm a left-leaning organic farming peacenik, and you're a dedicated member of the military-industrial complex.""Soleil Freeman and West Morgan had a brief affair five months ago. Although they heated up the sheets, their short lived liaison was more notable for the fighting. Now, months later, Soleil is noticeably pregnant and still in semi denial. A child had never been in her game plan. Added to that, she is struggling with exactly how to (whether to) tell West. He is a Special Forces officer in the Air Force and has been back at his base in Colorado since their last and, as it turns out, most consequential encounter.But surprise! West has come back to town to take care of his father who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and he runs into a Soleil who has some explaining to do.After I read this book I was both very impressed and profoundly disappointed. I think my disappointment comes from the fact that this was a nice read, but there was a great read struggling to get out. There was so much here that the reader could sink their teeth into and, unfortunately, none of it got the treatment it deserved.This book touched on the following: political identity & idealism, divorce, single parenthood v. marriage, how children view their parents and vice/versa, the ways in which children internalize parental expectations, and how love works with all of these.I think the cover of the book is so incredibly misleading. It is not some bubbly tale of a secret baby. Soleil's pregnancy and her reconnection with West is the main story, but the subplots and secondary characters are very vital and interesting in the story and are much deeper than the cover implies. And therein lies my biggest problem. I was incredibly engrossed in West's struggle with dealing with the twin blows of impending fatherhood and the fact that his larger than life father was going through terrifying bouts of dementia. I was equally drawn in by Julia's, West's mother's, re-entry into the dating world (she and West's father have been divorced for many years) and the wonderful new guy she meets. And I was incredibly intrigued by the very prickly, yet fascinating relationship Soilel has with her famous, idiosyncratic mother. BTW, I loved Soleil's background -- her hippie, down with the establishment middle class white-bread mother becomes a radical and hooks up with a Black Panther who himself later becomes establishment thereby dooming that relationship. Lol. Soleil's mother is a One woman character play waiting to happen.SO when the book ends with only West and Soleil's relationship sewn up, I felt like I was cut adrift. Even the resolution of West and Soleil's relationship wasn't completely satisfactory. It seemed so incredibly rushed. The two of them were coming from fundamentally different places. I never felt the two of them came together adequately for each other. Sure they pledge their love, but it is a Harlequin, you expect that. I didn't completely feel it. Don't get me wrong, the author creates a great connect between the two but she really needed more pages to explore it more.And that is the crux of the issue for me. I think this book needed a good 100 to 200 more pages to really satisfy me. The writing here was very good and the characters were excellent. I simply needed more time with them.",0

"Lacey Vaughn was unlucky in love.  None of her relationships ever work out, and now she had caught her latest boyfriend Evan cheating in the shower with her friend Christy.  She didn't understand what she was doing wrong, but could only determine she must be doing something wrong in bed, and that was why she kept having relationship problems.  Her best friend, Nick Stone thought that was laughable.  He had never been intimate with Lacey, but had been in love with her for a long time, and knew she wouldn't be a terrible bed partner.  He was just glad she was finally free so he could show her how good they would be together.This short read was ok, but didn't impress me very much as a large part of the premise was utterly absurd.  The conclusion that Lacey jumped to was not believable.  Instead of the myriad of reasons most women come up with for failed relationships - thinking they are not pretty, too fat, too serious, etc.  The only reason it could possibly be is sex.  We weren't provided any specific reasoning for this such as she was accused of being frigid or something.  I also didn't buy the alpha aspect with Nick.  He was labeled that way over and over again, but didn't really pull it off, and act it.  When he made statements such as ""you see me as sexless"" and I want you to see me as a man.  With most true alphas, it would never be a question.",0
"I didn't expect to write a review of this book.  I read a lot of books, way too many to do reviews for all of them, so I generally only write reviews if they were exceptionally good or really bad.  I don't want to take the time to review an average book.  And this one should have been average.  It reminded me of an 80's Harlequin, with Yanis, rich and powerful, dominating Lee throughout most of the book.  I was ok with that because I was in the mood for a ""mean"" hero and I thought the storyline flowed pretty well.  I noticed in reviews of her other books that people complained about grammatical errors.  There were plenty of those, but if the story is good enough I don't mind overlooking them.What I couldn't overlook was the overuse of the word ""had"".  By the middle of the book it was to the point that I couldn't even concentrate on the story because ""had"" kept jumping out at me.  Sometimes several in one sentence.  Out of curiosity I counted them once and there were 16 just on one page.  So I basically just skimmed the last half of the book because it was too painful plowing through the ""hads"".  But the story itself was good enough that I wanted to see how it ended.If not for all of the ""hads"" throughout the book I would have given it 3 stars.  It's a nice average story.  I got Kidnapped the Wrong Sister by this author because it was free and I'm sure I'll read it, but I noticed one of the reviews for that book also mentioned that had was overused, so it's obviously a trend.  That's too bad because her books have a lot of potential.  I don't think I will pay for any more of her books though.",0
This story is great for reading and it shows that love between two people no matter how long it takes .,1
"This book was just okay for me.  There seemed to be so much potential but topics were touched on rather than explored.  Nate is a human lie detector but this special talent was never used.  Joe is a werewolf and they live in a werewolf community but Joe only shifted twice.  The sex scenes were not sensual; mostly, grab the lube and get to it.  There is more to gay sex than anal sex, but the author seems to forget it.  I also found it very irritating that Joe referred to Nate constantly as ""little man,"" ""little mate,"" and ""baby.""  Most often, he treated Nate as a child.  I don't like it when a woman is treated like a child by the Alpha male and it was really annoying here.  Alpha males can be protective, domineering and strong without treating the partner like a child.I'll probably read the next book in the series to see if the writing gets any better.",0

Pleasant and believable characters and a decent story line. Desperately needs tighter editing. The run on sentences and grammatical errors were distracting and would be simple enough to solve. I felt I was reading a first draft.,1

"Unnecessary vulgar words...I could not get throughthe first chapter.  A book does not need offensivewords to make a steamy romance....This ""story "" wasmore about sex than romance and love with sex.",0
"I'm not sure what all of the high reviews are for. I muddled through and read the whole thing and I'm sorry, it was just dumb. The ending was ridiculous. The beginning of the book did have me interested, however, that fell off quickly when it became about nothing but describing the different ways &#34;X&#34; would punish the guys. This was not a mind bending thriller or anything even close. Maybe others enjoyed this but I was not impressed. The story fell so flat and I hate I wasted my time. Oh well...on to the next book. .",0
One of the best books I've read in a long time and I read all the time. Characters were realistic and funny. The story was fast paced and the book was very hard to put down.. I need to sleep but I can't until I've downloaded the next book.,1
"Where to begin? I guess I'll just jump right in and say I probably shouldn't have spent time reading this when I should have been spending it working on 2 essays that are due in 2 days. Working on essays for grad school would have been more fun than reading this book, sadly.The only characters I really liked were Madame Medusala and the mom. The hero and heroine had very little to bring to the story and that is sad, because there was really a lot of potential.  The story felt contrived, the dialogue forced and unfunny.  I could tell the author was going for breezy, funny, romantic banter but it just didn't work, and neither did the sex scenes. I'm far from a prude, it wasn't the biting that made me not like them (referring to the warning in the product description), it was more that there was very little build up, it happened the same day the hero and heroine met.  The romantic/sexual tension that I prefer in books was simply lacking.  The hero and heroine were too easily manipulated by outside forces (her father and Max).I don't know how much this version of the book changed from the original, but this book should have been a short story or a novella instead of a novel.I got the book when it was free from amazon so I don't have buyer's remorse; I didn't hate the book but I would only recommend this with reservations. Also, if I had been in a sillier mood when I read it, it might have worked (giving the benefit of the doubt).Sensuality: a few sex scenesRating: 2 stars",0
reading the series... all a light read. Not a heavy story but more of a relaxing read yet kept your interest,1
"I wasn't familiar with author Joe Hill's writing, so I figured this Kindle Single would be a good introduction, and it was. ""The Black Phone"" is one of the stories in Hill's book 20th Century Ghosts. [Note: the Amazon book description is for four different stories; only the last description that begins with ""John Finney..."" applies to ""The Black Phone.""]In the story, John Finney has been abducted by a man dubbed by the media as the Galesburg Grabber, a fiend who has already kidnapped and murdered several kids in the area. John found himself alone in a dark, cold basement that held only a toilet and--surprisingly--an old wall-type telephone that wasn't even connected. As John lost hope and despaired of his fate, he heard the old telephone ring. Was it his frightened imagination, or was someone else really on the line?I enjoyed the story very much. The storyline could have led to some explicit nastiness by the villain, but it didn't. After steadily building up tension, the story's climax was a surprise, but in the context of the story, it was a logical ending. To say anything more would be a spoiler.In a surprise twist, the author has hidden a second story, ""Scheherazade's Typewriter,"" in the acknowledgments after ""The Black Phone,"" so you're actually getting two stories with your download. ""Scheherazade's Typewriter"" was a very short but clever story that gave a new meaning to the word ""ghostwriter""!",1
"This story was nicely written, I immediately liked Gabby and Justin's characters. The plot was pretty straightforward. It had so many memorably sexy moments, that it's hard to pick just one. If you're looking for a story with a good romance and many love scenes then this one won't disappoint.",1
Not really a novel - just a study of the outlaw.  Should be in the textbook section.  My husband is an avid western reader but he hated this book.,0
"This is one of the most ridiculous books that I have ever read.  It doesn't seem as if the author understood very much about the way the world works at all.  One of the main characters became a lawyer right after graduating college (it doesn't seem as if the author knows about the existence of law school) and another main character is given full scholarships and acceptance letters from two different colleges from a high school teacher without even applying to either college.  The mechanics of adoption are also presented really fuzzily.  There are open adoptions available -- it doesn't have to be the way the author presented it.  You also just can't terminate a father's parental rights without giving a child up for adoption -- but I guess a lawyer who didn't go to law school can't be expected to challenge that.Aside from the facepalm-worthy factual errors, this book is just tedious to read.  Shawna is so thoughtless and dumb that she brings the vast majority of her problems upon herself.  The other characters are just like cardboard cutouts surrounding her.  Conrad and his mother are too evil to be believed and the various friends that Shawna makes along the way are just too good to be true while also inexplicably falling by the wayside when she actually needs help.Nobody really talks or acts like a real person.  It was unclear why Conrad wanted a family so much and why he had to have a sixteen-year-old as his girlfriend.  It was also unclear why Shawna would go along with this when she love him so little that she fell for the first guy who asked her out on a lunch date.Everything about this book is purely ridiculous.  Even if the editing issues were fixed, it isn't like reading a book set in the real world.  I would only recommend this for hardcore readers of woe-is-me fiction who will accept a massively unrealistic tacked-on happy ending.  Everyone else should avoid.",0
"My Soul to Lose is vivid and scary--definitely makes you want to stay out of the psychiatric hospital. But I thought it got a little confusing at the end--the scary payoff was a little muddled--and since I didn't immediately download the first book in the Soul Screamers series that this is a prequel to, I suppose that means it didn't do its job. But I haven't definitely decided against reading on in this series. On the plus side, there were no technical issues with this digital download that I noticed.",0
"As a long time hard copy by mail subscriber, I was thrilled for the first couple of years I got FT on my Kindle -- anywhere, anytime.  But what made the paper really special to me was the weekend section with Robin Lane Fox, special interviews, and real estate from all over the world.  Now I'll be searching for a new favorite Kindle newspaper subscription to fill this hole with a few nonessential but world-broadening insights I can simply enjoy occasionally.",0
I guess there are those that would enjoy this writing. I am not one. I read the entire book on my own throne as that seemed most appropriate.,0
"I have noticed many romance titles featured in Scotland.  Was it the skirts on the men?  Bagpipes?  Haggis (no, no, no) this is the story that will transport you to another world with people who feel as we do.  I don't like to repeat the story but I will tell you that I had such a sense of satisfaction and happiness after reading this skillfully written tale.  High recommended.",1
"Slow moving, silly waste of time. The entire story is poorly written and childishly plotted. No surprises here and I surely won't look for more from this author.",0
"This book only went from the bed to the hot tub and back to bed.  Other customer reviews didn't help in this case.  I was unfamiliar with this author or I never would have bought it.  I'm not a prude and a good lusty sex scene is good, but this was not even a good book.",0
"The tone of the story was fun.  I enjoyed the narration in the first paragraph or so.  And then the narration disappeared and it started to feel more like a screenplay.  It was mostly reading quotes and trying to remember who was talking in what order (and when a conversation involved more than two people I sometimes got lost).  There was very little description of either the surroundings or the characters, something I would have liked to help get lost in the story.  It was a quick read, though.",0
"Non-stop plot, which doesn't mean the plot is that bad: it's just all there is. No character development. But then, when the plot, which is the only thing carrying the story, gets predictable, it becomes completely uninteresting. The sample made me buy it, but it's not worth reading. Less than halfway through you know what's going to happen. And it does. Also extremely graphic in its violence. Will turn your stomach. There are better serial killer stories out there.",0

"An Arab youth finds an old jar in a cave in Jordan and in it is a scroll.  He takes it to Ramallah to his cousin to get it translated because it might have Kabbalist secrets and is questioned by an Israeli security service.  His body is found after being rammed by a car.Greg McKenzie,  retired OSI from the military, is hot headed and blurts out his opinions, which keeps him from advancement in the military and makes enemies for him with the Nashville Police Dept. when he worked there as a Detective for the D.A.'s office after retirement from the military.  Greg and his wife Jill visit Israel and the mid-east where a souvenir street vendor convinces Jill to purchase what appears to be an old scroll and she tucks it in her carryon.  After picking up their luggage at the airport on their return, they find the locks on the cases have been cut off and the luggage rifled.  Immediately after returning home, Jill suddenly disappears and Greg gets a phone call telling him they will exchange Jill for the scroll.  Greg takes it to two different professors who translate the scroll for him.  The story continues filled with murder, close escapes, car chases, a Palestinian radical group, an Israeli radical group and Jordan all after this scroll.  The story is  page turner, fascinating, fast moving and not very long.  It is an easy read and entertaining.  I recommend it.",1
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story.  Very refreshing.  Stayed up late to finish reading it.  Loved the development of all the characters.,1
The reporting is good - this is just higher priced than some other good newspapers so I tend to get the other newspapers which have basically the same news.,1
Not at all what I had expected. I was thinking it would be like the movie but was very pleasantly surprised.,1
"This is a little discovery. I have this book since a bit, but for one reason or the other, I wait to a lot before reading it. And I immediately discovered my mistake cause since the first pages you can understand that this is a great romance, that the fans of the genre will love.Alex is a wasp FBI Special Agent who has fought all his life to avoid the innuendo from friends or colleague about him being gay. Actually he has never desired men, he loves women and finds very attractive all the women are. Only he is also a very uptight middle-classe man, who loves to grew roses, write poems and paint. And since he is also an handsome, but not bulky man, he is always mistaken for a gay man.So when he is undercover with Shawn, a big Australian Special Agent, very manly and handsome, he is totally unprepared when the big guy hits on him, and openly declares his attraction for him and the desire to be his lover... in the submissive position! True, they are undercover as gay lovers, but it's not necessary to play the role when they are alone in their house, but Shawn has no restrain and in the end he manages to involve Alex in an hot relationship. But when their mission ends, what will remain to them? They are teammate and the Agency maybe will be not so happy to have two agents involved in an open gay relationship.I like very much as T.D. McKinney manages to mix romance with reality. True, some scenes are really stretched to the limit of reality (Shawn's woo of Alex), but hey, this is a romance, and I like to read those things, they appeal to the ultimate romantic who is in me. But Alex is also a character who thinks and before throws himself in a relationship with Shawn, he works very hard trying to drive him back. Shawn instead is the dream of every woman, and man maybe: attentive and loving, the right dose of push and comprehensive attitude.It's really interesting to read the dichotomy between Shawn, with his bulky body, who is instead the more feely touching and exuberant in the couple, and Alex, who I envision like the classical prim and proper character, who seems cold and aloof, but when they threaten his lover, he reacts like a poisonous snake: silent but deadly.Only one remarks, very minimal indeed: T.D: McKinney is very good in writing the sex scenes, build them with a growing pathos, but she shut the doors in the apex... why does she not let peep in a little more?",1
"I'm not one to give two stars, but I have good reason with this book. First, let's start with the positives- The main characters were well developed and likable. The story line was interested, though at first I was sure I was reading a book I'd already read (similar beginnings to a few other romances). Those were the redeeming qualities. Now on to the negative. There was not a lot of sexual tension. The author doesn't seem passionate when writing scenes between the two characters. There's no steam, no heart pounding will he or won't he. The scene where the two finally get together is so late in the book it could have been passed over completely. The scene itself completely lacks the passion these two characters were capable of. So deflated of a scene I was shocked. Really, really not a book I could recommend.",0
"This was a fairly interesting read.  It had old- style terminology.I was glad to get  to read a story that doesn't have coarse, crasslanguage.  I read for fun and relaxation......I like the free ebooksbecause I can check out a writer and decide if they are intriguing,innovative, and have enough of the command of Englishthat they can convey the story without crude language.",1
"One of those bubble gum love stories. It was funny, sex was hot as hell but other than that it was an ok read. Glad it was free.",0
"(May contain spoilers)The book starts out solid and interesting. Then in the middle everything shifts and explodes into a bad plot twist. When I read the summary and it mentioned gods I figured it would be figurative, however they were not. This author put flat out religious, ridiculous, prophetic god characters into what began as a solid space apocalypse plot. It's just way too much.To have the apocalypse happen in a dystopian future while also throwing in some space tech walks a fine line between a great story plot and having too much going on. The author was doing quite well until deciding it was time to throw the whole thing off a cliff, kill off a bunch of characters, add an unconvincing romance, and let loose a ""twist"" in the form of gods who are suddenly the reason behind the apocalypse. Additionally the main character goes from being a fairly strong female character who holds no belief in religion to bring a forlorn, love struck, weakling who laments death and embraces the ""goddess"" that claims her. Nonsense.The only reason this gets two stars is because the first half of the book was a solid story. Before it went off to crazy land I was intrigued and excited to finish the book. The ""teaser chapter"" at the end of the book promises that the next book will be even worse than the last half of this one, so I won't even bother. Sad to see such a promising plot get blown up in the efforts of an author to reach beyond the limits of their plot line. At least there weren't any zombies, cause then it would have just been a straight up joke.",0
"Sharon Mahoney and her son Greg have moved back to California from New York after her husband/his father died unexpectedly from a heart attack and then Sharon is laid off from the school where she teaches. Her sister lands her a job at a school in California and even finds her a place to rent, so Sharon and Greg pack up their minivan and travel across the country to the start of a new life.The old house with the apartment for rent is old, creepy and even has a resident ghost, the man who was accused of killing the current owner's sister. The sister, Jody, still lives there and her great-nephew, Ian Fanning, lives there, too. The last couple living there is a distant cousin and her husband. Strange things are said to happen in the house and Sharon and Greg see some really weird things themselves. Who is the ghost and what is he/she trying to tell the people living there? Will the anniversary of the murder, fast approaching, bring another death or will the cycle be broken?This was a great story. Well-written and smooth-flowing with well-fleshed characters and an interesting plot I couldn't wait to find out how it all played out. This was my first read of Jacqueline Diamond, but it won't be my last.*The author provided a copy of this book to me for review. Please see disclaimer page on my blog.",1
"Sydney Somer's Primal Hunger is one of those stories that disappoint me, not for what it is, but for what it could be and yet isn't. Full of interesting mythos, a spunky heroine with a backbone, and an Alpha male to drool for, the building blocks exist to make this title a really fantastic paranormal romance. Unfortunately, the combination of the length of the story (far closer to novella than mass market paperback) and the focus on the sexual relationship between the two main characters, Kennedy and Tristan, kept this book from truly blossoming into a fully satisfying read for me. And that's a shame, because there really was a lot to like about Somer's writing style and creativity here.Ultimately, there just wasn't enough story to raise my appreciation for the book higher than three stars. I'm a huge fan of erotic fiction. I actually prefer my books with healthy, adult, explicit sex scenes that help define and enhance the romantic pairing between couples in paranormal romances, and I'm very open minded about sex in general. Flowery euphemisms and delicate wording are a turnoff - in life and in books. That being said, however, my preference is that the story comes first and the sex scenes be a part of that story, not the whole of the story. In Primal Hunger, the sex (while steamy, hot, and very erotic) was the center of the story and the plot and mythos about the gargoyles, wraiths, Avalon, King Arthur, Fae, as well as the development of the emotional side of Kennedy and Tristan's relationship, were more like random leaves being tossed around in the cyclone of the sexual relationship. That was such a shame, because I love gargoyles and wish there were more paranormal romances that featured them, and Arthurian novels have always been an interest of mine. By the end, I basically enjoyed Primal Hunger for what it is, but felt disappointed by all the missed opportunities to raise the bar. Still, I've got the  second in the Pendragon Gargoyles series, Primal Attraction, so I'll be giving the series at least one more go.",0

"Catherine Cullen-Wellesley has reached her breaking point.  Her husbands have been taking her for granted and over the past several months have blown off every date she's set up.  She wholeheartedly loves them but nurturing their relationship has fallen by the wayside in their course to better their business.  It's their five year anniversary and she has some very exciting news but their neglect has her questioning if she should stay or kiss them goodbye.Logan and Rhys have invested a year's worth of time in securing the biggest contract of their business career.  Unfortunately the client keeps jerking them around.  In their determination to make more money they've lost sight of what's truly important - their unique relationship with Cat.  They soon realize that their drive for success could quite possibly cost them the love of their lives.It's been three months since Cat was last intimate with Logan and Rhys.  They've been too wrapped up in their business ventures to pay her much attention and she's sunk into a pit of despair and loneliness.  The men completely forgot about their anniversary dinner and then canceling out on their Jamaican vacation is just too much.  She's played second best for far too long.  Cat has every intention of going on this vacation - with or without them.  It will give her a chance to relax and reevaluate her situation.  What she doesn't expect is for her unexpected absence from their home to open Logan and Rhys eyes to the possibility of a life without her.  Logan and Rhys have made a success of their business but their marriage is on the verge of failure.  Will they find a way to balance the two or is it already too late to rectify the wrongs they've done to Cat?If you think being in a menage a trois relationship means that you'd never feel neglected or taken for granted then you're wrong.  In Maya Banks STAY WITH ME, Cat, Logan and Rhys are forced to face the fact they're all to blame for the break down in their marriage.  Cat's been too compliant and never voiced her unhappiness.  Logan and Rhys are so career driven that they didn't realize that they were hurting her by not being more attentive.  If their marriage is going to succeed they're all going to have to put each other first, but can the men really delegate their business to office hours only?Maya Banks has become one of my favorite authors because of her emotionally driven storylines.  In STAY WITH ME readers will be drawn into the story and come to really care about the characters and maybe even live vicariously through them.  Who wouldn't like to have two sexy men doing everything in their power to make sure you don't leave them?  This is a wonderful story that I'll definitely be adding to the keeper shelf - along with the rest of Ms. Banks' books.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1

I read all of the reviews on this book I was expecting much better it certainly didn't meet my expectations. I appreciate the general message but was disappointed.,0
"OK there is a disturbing trend starting to develop.  In the 8th book in the series, her own dog Rusty was violently injured.  Now in this 9th book, her clients cat was murdered.  This animal cruelty trend is very ugly and not needed.  I hope the author stops the animal cruelty and killing in her books or I shall stop reading everything by her.This book is nice in that it has her back at her own business and working with her brother again. Rusty is her companion again.  This is all good and a well-needed change from the last book.Her husband is pouting because after crashing and almost being killed in a helicopter in the last book, she doesn't jump up and fly for him everytime he needs her to.  Flying is his passion, not hers, but he's being a baby about it.  Just never have warmed up to Drake.The storyline and plot is good, and like I mentioned, good to have her back at her own job with her brother and dog.  But had to take major points off, again, for the animal abuse issue.",0
"It's not really an entire story. It's more like the sample you get when you try out other paid works. There's no characterization to speak of or story/plot development. Am I crazy to expect some literature even from free stuff? Of course, I need to pay so I can find out what happens next. I'd have been tempted if I were actually given something meaty, but this is crap, even it I didn't pay anything for it. Let's see: she leaves a mysterious note, gets him to have phone sex and then actual sex in the dark (don't their eyes eventually get used to the darkness?) and then she leaves. Pay up to read them do more of the same, not even erotic, stuff? I don't think so.",0
"Thank heavens there is a dictionary feature in Kindle!  The antiquated language was ponderous as was the unnecessary prosaic verbiage as well as detail beyond all reason.  I found them charming, but I would never read any more of them.  They are an acquired taste.  If you don't love old English novels, don't bother.  If you like Doyle & Christie, you'll probably find them interesting.  For the price, they are a bargain.",0
"Not awful, just not particularly memorable. Decent sex scenes, decent characters - kind of like cotton candy, fun while it lasts but then you want something more substantial.",0
"Generally I'm one of those people who, when I start a book I read it all the way through. I couldn't with this one. The main character drove me crazy from the get go. She's not much younger than me but she acted like a teenager, I wondered if it hadn't been written by one. I admire people who write and put their work out there to the world, and I hate to say it really but I wouldn't waste the money on this. It's repetitive to the point of insanity. I'm sure the story line is fine, I think I would have enjoyed it had it not had the issues I just couldn't get past. I found myself skimming over it by chapter 5 and finally had to stop reading it altogether.",0

"Ugh - the tired trope of moms being awesome.  I mean, moms are awesome (especially mine), but the whole ""moms can beat anybody!"" thing is hardly a basis for a realistic short story.  It's a one-joke, one-note story.",0
"I`ve read one of the other books in this series and liked it. I like Alpha males as long as the women are strong too. And as long as there`s no rape. Being Alpha does not mean you have to rape women even if you`re stronger than them and want them.Unfortunately this had a heroine who was supposed to be strong but wasn`t at all. And there was rape. These are the two main things I have against this book.Casey was captured from Earth when she was trying to run away from an ex who wanted to rape her. Only to end up with a Zorn who not only kidnaps her but also treats her very poorly. He rapes her (and yes, it`s rape if someone says no even if she`s forced to orgasm) and is forgiven for that. I find it very disturbing that a woman who escapes rape ends up being raped - and that is portrayed as a good thing.There are probably some readers who can accept rape-turns-into-love, but for those of you who are like me - this is not a book for you!",0
Well written short story that may come across as a teaser for other books of the author but can easily stand on its own. Gory entertainment for readers with a preference for the perverted variety of killers.,1
"Wow,This story really had it all. God I'm such a sucker for ""been in love since their childhood"" romances that I read the info sheet and loaded it up on my kindle.Sukie has had breast cancer. She quit a big, well paying job and with the help of her Brother Sean O'Leary(gotta love the names!) she opened up a yarn/knitting shop. Sean has been best buddies with Eamon Houlihan, big time Hockey Pro, since they were kids. Sukie was always the little sister tag -a- long.No one knew she fantasized about Eamon since oh, like forever and same goes for Eamon with his hidden feelings for Sukie.What started out as a no strings attached one night stand offer from Sukie to Eamon-then it's let's go back to just being friends--turns into the expected results that generally follows the ""friends with benefits"" incident.No strange circumstances or elaborate plot lines, just good 'ol fashioned tender heartfelt romance. (with nice-not trashy- sex)I loved Eamon from ""Hello"" and Sean's love for his sister is well portrayed. Sukie is written like someone you want to hug and make your best friend forever. This is a very sweet story with a ""kleenex required"" label.Enjoy---I Did.Thanks Kelsey! I'll be looking up more of your stuff.",1
"I admit it, I snapped this up the moment I saw it on new releases, because I tend to do that with anything written by Timothy Zahn. He is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building, intricate plot, and edge-of-seat action. His Thrawn and Conqueror's trilogies were incredible, Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging, and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent. So I figured this would be too.First off, when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud ""Huh? That's it?!"" I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else. It is a really short story, barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales' Star Wars series (and those books have several of them!). It's also, I must say, a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I've seen Zahn write. It's not terrible, but it really isn't that great either- there's no twists and at the end you're left wondering where the other half of the story is. The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable (as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops) and though there is quite a bit of action, it kind of reads like a (short) movie or videogame script.Overall, not worth paying for. In fact, it should really be free if you ask me.",0
"I could easily be talked into giving this four stars for its high adventure, intriguing mystery and appealing characters. You've got to love a book that grabs you right from the beginning:""Are we rising again?"" ""No on the contrary."" ""Are we descending?"" ""Worse than that, captain! We are falling!"" ""For heavens sake heave out the ballast!"" ""There! The last sack is empty!"" ""Does the balloon rise?"" ""No!"" ""I hear a noise like the dashing of waves! The sea is below the car. It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!"" ""Overboard with every weight!...everything!""I must say, that listening to this (via the Kindle's speech feature while I was driving) was better than having to read all those exclamation points, but I was hooked and enjoyed the vicarious adventure.Jules Verne's MYSTERIOUS ISLAND embraces the ever-popular story line of men surviving--even thriving--on a deserted island, but instead of getting there by shipwreck, these men have escaped from a Civil War Richmond under siege in a hot air balloon and are blown thousands of miles off course in the grip of a raging storm. Eventually, their balloon loses air and they fall into the sea and are washed up on an island. There they establish a settlement, and with remarkable know-how, tenacity, and courage, they make quite a nice life for themselves that lasts about four years, despite the challenges of tempest, wild animals, injuries, pirates, and, most intriguingly, a mysteriously benevolent but invisible presence that seems to defy the castaways' belief that they are alone on the island.This book was written in 1874, and must surely have been influenced by SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON which was written in 1812. The similarities are striking in the remarkably clever things the castaways envisioned, built or fabricated to ensure their comfort and safety...everything from their lodging and outbuildings to a small sailing ship. Between them, they conveniently brought extensive knowledge of engineering, sailing, ship-building, astronomy, geography, botany, and chemistry.The book does bog down occasionally, and the 19th century language is somewhat stilted. Every conversation seemed to include a ""my boy"" or ""my man""  or ""my friend"" (e.g., ""'No doubt, my boy,' answered the engineer...""). The characters were ennobled by the author to be unrealistic paradigms of 19th century virtue: industrious, courageous, practical, and compassionate.But these are quibbles in the face of the pleasure given by such a good story, and the way Jules Verne tied this book in with the story from 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA was an interesting and unexpected twist. This book is a classic for a reason.",0
My views of this book are hard to sum up. I was inclined to drift off the dedicated path. It may have been a topic I was slow to find an interest. Maybe it was not what I had expected or imagined. What ever it was I was slow to want to pick it up again.,0

"This is the 1st book I read by Patricia McLinn. This book started off good as it continued it became very slow & boring. If this book wasn't so slow moving, if there was more of a romantic feel between the characters I think I could have got more interested in this one.",0
enjoyable,1
Pretty much boring.....not well laid out.  Kept jumping from present to past without a clear break. Book not edited well,0
"I think this is a good start for a new author.  He should consider engaging an editor and fact checker.  His writing style moves the near-term story along at a nice pace.  Had there been fewer errors, I would have rated this as a 4 star instead. I did feel like it got bogged down in the overall story arc (start to finish), but that was as much to do with my preferences as the writer's style.",0
"This book was good and I'm not usually into younger man older women, but this book did it for me! I would totally recommend this book to anyone. I can't wait to get more of her books to reads.",1
"A novel set in ancient Egypt of the Pharaohs, date unspecified. It is a story of royalty and the succession of the ruler of Egypt. It is the love story of a young woman, Tua,  who is the only child and heir of the Pharaoh. He, Rames is the son of a king of a kingdom to the south of Egypt, who is now in Egypt, and is raised and trained for the army.  They spend some time together as children, and he saves her life from a  crocodile, while losing he little finger of his right hand to the croc. They get separated, and she becomes Pharoeh upon the death of her father.The book includes wizards and magic by different characters. Lots of interesting twists and turns involving a Ka for Tua, which is a duplicate for her person granted by the gods which can be called up. It is called up and rules in her place for two years when Tua is being pressured to marry her uncle who is 40 years older than her.It starts out slow, but picks up. The ties to ancient Egypt could be much better done.If you like adventure stories with a love component set in Egypt of thousands of years ago, this could be of interest.",1
"I purchased this book because I had read several of this authors other books and was please. Well this one was a BIG Disappointment. I guess if you like to read books about weak woman then this is your book, to be fair I will say i didn't or should i say couldn't finish it because I couldn't get by main character's low self-esteem, her self-pity or her jealousy of her sister Nora. She was suppose to be the older sister but she acted like the baby with so much resentment and really all because of her short comings.Don't waste your money or time. If you can get pass the first 4 Chapters then you might enjoy it like those that gave this such high stars.",0
"I was surprised.  For a short book, the story was easy to follow and didn't jump around.I will be checking out more from Elle Kennedy.",1
"FBI Special Agent Alex Ware and his partner, Special Agent Shawn Matthews are in deep trouble. Deep undercover to try to nail a particularly offensive weapons trafficker who doesn't trust nor do business with sexually straight people, they're forced into an intimacy that Alex hadn't anticipated - but what really makes him worry is just how much he enjoys the six month deep cover operation. What shocks him is when his Aussie partner and friend, Matthews, comes clean on both his bi-sexuality AND his interest in Alex. An interest that supersedes any work-related cover op.And from that point on, Alex's life - as neurotic and repressed as it was - turns on its ear and becomes uncomfortable, uncertain, and wracked with yearning. In short, utterly unrecognizable.Shawn is adorable in his open devotion to Alex, and Alex is quirky and frustrating in turns as he struggles with his fear and sexual confusion. As a character driven cop thriller, their relationship is the best part of Matter of Necessity.It's a solid short story, but it could have been truly great had there been more depth and detail given on their undercover assignment and fleshed out to a full length novel. The glossed-over introduction to the thug they're trying to bring down lessened the tension of the cop thriller aspect of the story. I also would've liked a bit more detail on the physical aspect of Shawn and Alex's relationship.",0
But at times the author couldn't' keep their own character's straight. Good thing it was a simple story without many characters.  Too easy to actually..,0
"This story is a short story out of a larger book from Stephen King's son.  It is a nice quick read and if you like this short story, check out the rest of the stories.  Some are better than others but all were really good.",1
"I didn't finish this book, got bored hence the default 1* rating. Poorly written, not enough detail, gaping plot holes, and tedious.I'm not sure what category to put this in - this story is- NOT erotica (As some reviewers have pointed out. Not enough sexual tension etc);- NOT SciFi; far too unimaginative and unsophisticated;- NOT well written enough or engrossing to be a good story- hence may be it's geared towards the tender romance variety? But I didn't feel any chemistry for that either.Overall, perhaps it's just a little bit of the above genres but not enough to be any of thoseI like books that capture my interests. There are some books that require one to read a good few chapters before one is engrossed. Due to the gaping plot holes, the poor writing style and lack of imagination this didn't intrigue me.=================The Characters:Heroine: Mari speaks many different languages and is a linguist, hence she picks up the Alien language very quickly. Her age wasn't really mentioned in the chapters I read, but the readers are informed on numerous occasions that she has vivid red hair (I assume she's a natural ginger sans freckles). She's defiant and originally challenges her captors. However, after the hero spares her, she's rather mellow and doesn't seem freaked out by being far away from earth and living in Alien territory.Hero: apart from being rather tall with cat like eyes, there's not much Alien about him that i could tell. Mari, the heroine describes him as resembling Native Americans, however, I've never seen bronze 7 feet Native Americans (the few I met were mixed heritage and resembled light-skinned Hispanic). He's rather mild, not the Alpha Male type. Basically, he's a tall, dark handsome cliche found in chick lit but with feline eyes. It's unfortunate the author didn't make him purple or blue skinned with horns on his head or something more imaginative. Tall, bronze skinned with long black hair reminds me of men I've seen from certain Middle Eastern countries and Punjab.================Plot holes:I'm not going to mention the glaringly obvious plot holes or I'll give away the story. However, a few are:1. The Alien species can speak English. Even the heroine points out that if one can converse with a species than it doesn't make much sense to allocate them as pets or food? The responding argument was not convincing enough to make this plot work. Even during the slavery trade - one of the reasons why slavers believed they were dealing with inferior species was because they believed the Africans they dealt with did not have a formal language or a proper culture.2. The Aliens believe that the humans are primitive and don't posses a proper culture. Considering that Earth has satellite it would be pretty easy for the Aliens to pick up a huge amount of data which would prove that humans have a form of electronic communication, entertainment and civilisation. The Aliens own form of living isn't very sophisticated hence I didn't understand why they thought they were so much more superior? I appreciate it might be a denial process (to justify the capturing of women) but again far too far fetched an argument. The Aliens technology such as their ""blackberry"" type hand held computer would be easily spotted by any number of aliens visiting earth.3. Considering the Aliens were suffering plagues and so forth - surely earth would have far more valuable possessions than human meat that would help them - additionally, you'd think they'd have sophisticated vaccinations or protective gear too.4. Mari manages to convince the Aliens within a space of a few minutes that she ought to be allowed to stay awake and engage in conversation with them. It seems that the aliens capitulated far too quickly. The story also jumps so one minute she's woken up and confronting them and the next minute we're told it's been a few days and they're impressed by her oddity.5. The Aliens do not look much different from many humans living on Earth. If they'd traveled to South East Asia, the Middle East or even the Far East they'd see beings much like them. Hence, their incredulity over Mari being able to engage in conversation with them is baffling. In fact even if they were to visit Norway or Iceland they'd find Viking like tall people (when I go there I feel like a munchkin and I'm 5.9). Hence, the story just wasn't convincing.I can't get into the reasons properly because I don't want to give away the story. I think it would be better if the Aliens found Mari in a primitive planet where her spaceship and stranded. The beings of that planet could be primitive but human physically and thus they mistaken her for one of them - when she's out bathing or something. She eventually slowly learns a few of their tongue and thus they are shocked by her even talking to them.================Summary of Plot:Mari (a human) was collecting eggs when she's captured by an Alien species with the intention to sell her at a meat market (humans are an expensive delicacy for certain species). The Aliens failed to tranquilize her properly and hence she wakes up to find herself naked and trapped in a cage on a cargo spaceship.She engages with her captors who are surprised by her ""intelligent"" form of interaction as they assume humans to be uncivilised and non-sentient beings. When they try to return her to hypersleep, she resists. Within the space of a few minutes and without much persuasion she manages to convince them to allow her to stay awake and in a page or two later she's managed to persuade the Hero that's she's not a pet or food.",0
"Just discovered this series and author and I have to say, I love what I read.  I can not wait to dive further into the series.  Worth the money and the time (which is quick).",1
"I've been reading USA Today for over 5 years. I love the content, the features, the pictures. It's my favorite newspaper.Trying out the Kindle version, you get the articles but sometimes they're not formatted correctly. I did notice some black and white photos. Even if they had the photos that accompany the article in black and white that would be good.I tried it for a week while on vacation. I was able to keep up to date with the news but after that week, I decided to cancel it. I can't see myself canceling my print edition to read it on  Kindle.Hopefully, they'll improve it in the future. But now, just try it out for free to see for yourself.",0
Not long enough too give an accurate review.  It has potential.  At least it didn't give me a headache!..I'll buy more of Bartlett's books.,0
"I really did not like it. Hard to keep up with, the characters and storylines are way too numerous and disjointed. Didn't end up finishing it and I'm an avid reader.",0
I gave it a four only because it lagged in the dialogue but other than that it was great. I thought that the heady depiction of the craziness that happens at the beginning of a relationship was amazing! I definitely would read more from this author.,1
"Okay paper but just not quite up to others, like the NY Times or The Chicago Tribune. Sports section is good but everything else is sorely lacking.",0
"I've tried reading this book numerous times over the past couple of weeks but for some reason, I can't get into it. After reading a few other reviews I see I'm not alone in my thinking. Normally, I have to finish a book once I start it this book has made me change that personal policy. I got stuck at 40% and couldn't go on.As a fan of this time period and the Salem story in general, I find their beliefs interesting and amazing. Sorry to say, this book just didn't do anything for me.",0
"I really liked this book. The characters were well-developed and the story believable. It kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next. There's a lot of sadness in Phoebe's life, and it doesn't look to get much better until a stranger offers his friendship. The characters are much like I would imagine they would be in the time period in which the story is set. I had to remind myself a few times that this story was written when women had few rights and were at the mercy of the men in their lives, as well as their surroundings. It was extremely rare for a woman to be able to live a self-supporting, independent life in those days, and I would imagine many had few or no close friends. This book made me want to reach into the story and clobber the bad guy, rescue the girl, and chastise the ignorant family members. I recommend it to those who like a clean romance that's not too mushy and a story with substance.",1
"I really enjoyed the story, but the writing is a bit of a problem. The author is very comma-happy and tends to insert them randomly in the middle of sentences. Quite a few grammatical issues, as well. Needs a good editor or three.Plot progression is solid, though exposition is weak in places, particularly the very beginning and the very end. The author also forgets to tie up loose ends on the main subplot, which is disappointing. I really enjoyed the fantasy tangent about halfway through--it melded perfectly with the rest of the story. Well done. Good characterization. Subplots get a bit messy; the author seems to struggle a little bit to keep it all organized and keep track of everything, but that's a common issue.Overall, the major problems could be fixed with a line editor and a developmental editor, and possibly some work with a writing consultant to help with some bad habits.The story is excellent, so I plan on trying further works by this author to see if the writing improves to match the story composition.",0
"This was a funny, good short read. The hero changed his mind about relationships a bit fast for me.I recommend for a pre bedtime read if you can't fall asleep.",0
"I downloaded this book for FREE!!! Really enjoyed, pleasantly surprised. I would definitely recommend. This was my first ever download and I found they whole process really really easy",1
"This was the first book I read by this author.  The plot immediately pulled me in, and the sexual tension between the H and the h was hot and intense.  I didn't want this story to end.",1
I found  it sad that Jesse died and I know how Sarah feels because she lost the love of her life.,1
Funny I was going to title my review HUH???? but someone else felt the same and used it.I'd say this was a waste of paper but since none was used I'd say it was a waste of my time even though it was free.OK so you find out that Minerva had an abusive marriage. Her husband belonged to some group of rufians that they never go in any detail over.Her son married a druid which I still can't figure out where that made any difference in the story.Minerva meets Gregory a man interested in the quilt she is working on and becomes a visitor frequently coming for tea.One of her deceased husbands friends from this group he belonged to calls on her to start and abusive relationship with her. Gregory surprises him and stands up to him and just like that the other guy goes running. Gregory admits his feelings for Minerva.  I got to the last page and flipped it to the next when I realized that was the ending.  Glad now it wasn't any longer.  Don't waste your time.,0
"Short stories and novellas are literature forms that have always been favorites of mine, especially Vonnegut and Hemingway.  This brief tale has potential, but it has been squandered.",0
The author has a great imagination. He takes zombies in a whole different direction to a destination I haven't figured out yet but am anxious to find. Worth the read.,1
"This book deserves 2.5 stars. It's not the worst thing I've read, yet it wasn't the best either.The protagonist, Emily Fenwick, is a police officer who is suddenly whisked into an alternate New York set in 1890. Except it's not really an alternate New York, nor are there any scenarios that could be labeled steampunk. It's more fantasy-based with a world that I found intriguing.Emily wakes up in Steamside, a world connected to 1890's ""normal"" New York. Steamside's inhabitants are refugees like Emily who long to return to their times. Why are they here? It's not clearly explained, and that's not a good thing, which is a shame because Steamside is interesting.Rather, the setting is used more as a backdrop to a juvenile, nonsensical romance between the two leads. POVs were difficult to distinguish, and the dialogue was all jumbled up. The romance was tedious and unbelievable. Have I mentioned juvenile?It was a fun read, but Steamside Chronicles just wasn't the best.",0
"This gives you first hand experiences of people in the early tank service, where they came from, and how they performed.  Great view of history.",1
"I felt very frustrated for Kaylee, reading this novella. I really enjoyed this novella as it made me feel more for her character than I probably have since reading the series. To wake up cuffed to a bed in the Mental Health Centre , scared and sore and confused.Lydia is a little mystery, who is she? I figure not a Banshee. I am glad Kaylee had this girl who obviously understood her and helped her. More than her own family.Aunt Val needed a good slap from me...karma is all I will say. As I read My Soul To Take before I read the prequel novella, it made me even more annoyed at Kaylee's aunt and uncle....really how dare they be so disloyal to family. How awful to be placed in a Psych Ward when they knew what was wrong with her. Her uncle really should have known better. I am still a little confused as to why he even let it happen, it's not like it was going to go away. Kaylee needed help from those she trusted who understood.Michelle",1
I just wish it were longer. It was a cute erotic romance. I am a huge fan a menage best friend romances. I Love how well the characters fit together. It was a great read. Good Job Mari Carr,1
"this is a ""romance"" that is NOT - just a lot of not very well written sex.  smut without a redeeming story...",0
"Not what I expected by the book description...Jessica is not the typical innocent drawn to a professor but - for at least the first part of the relationship - she is definitely the aggressor...Too fast they get into the bsdm stuff...that part was ok but not great...I think the author tried to include too much considering the size of the story turning it into a too forced and rushed plot ( it felt like: ok I have only 60 pages, lets describe and make them practice everything that I know about BDSM...) Don't get me wrong, there are so many great erotica books even shorter than this one that I love and in which authors are able to develop a plot despite the few pages... so to me the problem is not the size but the writing...not recommendable if you are looking for something more than sex.",0
"Book 3 of Bell's ""Halle Pumas"" series. Preceded bySweet Dreams. Followed bySteel Beauty.Books 1 to 3 are available as a paperback anthologyMating Games.Plot:Sheri can't keep running from her stalker, and when Max and Simon invite her to join the Pride, she takes her chance to gain some peace. But the stalker is still out there, and getting closer, and now Adrian wants to Mate her, is she strong enough to keep them both safe?Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting) SmallTown romance with explicit bedroom scenes.- 1982 kindle locations, 20,000 words (short novella), but finishes around 1704 locations.- m/f - explicit, reasonably frequent, *happy*.- ""Cat of a Different Color"" picks up as Book 1 ends. Sheri was introduced in passing as the discoverer of Becky's issues. Adrian has made cameos as Max's optometrist partner.- Sheri has ""type one albinism"" - she's legally blind (20/200), sensitive to light, and has a seeing-eye dog, Jerry. Bell addresses her issues with care and sensitivity, emphasising Sheri's strengths and abilities.- Sheri is also the survivor of domestic abuse. She ""got out"" before it became too bad, but he has since stalked her. Sheri is a smart and intelligent woman who made some bad choices that haunted her future.- As a ""series"", the first three books should really be seen as a trilogy where the stories support each other. You *could* read them independently, as stand alones, but would get more satisfaction from reading them in sequence.- Includes excerpts fromFelicity Stripped Bareby Vanessa Jaye, andDunmore Risingby Gia Dawn.- There is a ""free read"" available on the author's website which gives us a little epilogue of Adrian and Sheri, ""The Ornament Book 3"".Opinion:Another clever novella in the ""Halle Pumas"" series, Bell gives us action, love, caring and respect. The Mating Imperative is rapid. The ""I love you""s come pretty fast. But the shifting is important, the one-liners are fun, and the sex is steamy. I like it. I like the series. And I am happy to recommend them.4.5 stars rounded up. Sheri has strength. The book is short but the care Ms Bell has taken in giving Sheri a handicap, and a stalker, is worth the read. Rounding up because I like a heroine with a difference.""The Ornament Book3"":After what Adrian did to her lawn with Christmas Decorations, he definitely has a lot of making up to do. An unexpected surprise and lots of hot sex will go a long way into Sheri's heart.A sweet erotic short story of their first Christmas together. A nice epilogue to keep the readers happy.-CR-",1
"Nice idea, real people, nice development for a short piece, nice writing, HOT sex, but....Follow through is a little weak.

"A great bargain for a Kindle and I think a Bible is a necessity on a Kindle.  With a little practice, it is easy to switch back and forth between verses.  I love the Amplified version. Much easier to tote to church than a paper or hardback Bible.  I love it.",1
"The story was great. I am a big fan of horror/mystery/suspense. This had everything, white knuckle moments, breath holding suspense, a little gore to make you a little sick. My only problem was that it was way too short. I was so intrigued by the story that I wanted it to go on for at least a few more chapters. The story line was there, so did the author run out of ideas? The author needs to read a little Stephen King to learn how to extend a story. What a great creepy one this could have been.",0
"This book was entertaining.  I enjoyed reading it but was disappointed with the abrupt ending.SPOILERSAva and Landon met, generated some fabulous heat and set the stage for overcoming the problem of Ava being the ""runt of the litter"".  Other minor characters are introduced that reinforce the lack of standing she has with the pride and put in place some politics that may need to be faced by Ava and/or Ava and Landon.But then they're solved by a simple declaration by Landon that she's his mate - huh???  Ava didn't really have to confront anyone, no one really offered an objection, yet all of the previous treatment of Ava would indicate that there should have been some of these problems to deal with.The author completely skipped the dealing with the issue to get to the happy ever after and just gave us the HEA leaving the issues supposedly solved but in my mind undealt with.The book had great potential, had the author stuck with the basic format of a romance novel and had our couple face and deal with their issues it would have been reached.  Instead it was an entertaining read but fell short leaving you wandering what happened.",0

"Pat Anjali is the da man of an overview of spiritual practice, from an Indian perspective 600 AD.

"When I got the first High heels book a few months ago I really liked it, it was different, it was fast, fun and entertaining and I enjoyed the characters. So I went for the whole box. But what a disappointment! Halfway through book number two I had to give up, I had got completely fed up with Maddie, her friend and their stupid behaviour, and the ""affair"" with the detective that continues to never happen. I just couldn't care less about what happened to her. I know of course that they must become an item eventually but I will not waste time reading about it.(I am sorry to say that I felt exactly the same about this author's Hollywood Headlines series)",0

"This was a nice little story. A follow on in the series.  I loved getting to know Will.  He is different from the other guys in the SEAL team.  Maybe it is because he is a commanding officer?  But he seemed a little more, reserved than the other guys.  I loved that about him!  Especially since he has been in love with his best friend Mackenzie for 15 years!  Staying power or what?Mackenzie was a little difficult to like I found.  She had so many hang ups!  I couldn't believe how she denied herself Will and friend zoned him for so long!  Thank goodness for the visions!  Personally I thought it was more like her mind was telling her thru her subconscious dreams to take the bull by the horns, admit your feelings for your best friend, and BAM!  Happy days!  Long nights, and satisfaction all round!But of course she had to over think things!  Loved the tactic Will employed with the help of Carson's (previously in Heat of Passion) gf Holly.Nice read!",0

"I really enjoyed reading the first book in the Badlands Series about Logan, Derick, Miranda, Clyde & Clarissa all of them are looking forward to meeting there mail-order bride and or there new husbands. The story starts out with Logan & Derrick waiting at the train station for their mail-order bride that they specifically picked named Miranda, now this is the seventh day and she still hasn't shown and neither one wants to go back to their ranch without her. Finally after about two hours of waiting the train whistle can be heard, the guys are anxiously awaiting when the train pulls up and several people get off and leave but no Miranda. So when the conductor gets off they ask him and he says, &#34;I don't know, but I'm in a hurry to fetch the sheriff because at the last bridge a young woman jumped off the train, while we were moving very fast. According to a young woman behind the conductor it was in fact Miranda who jumped. Just great now what are we supposed to do, we don't have a wife now! Clarissa felt bad for these two guys they were both very good looking but very different, one was dark haired and one was light haired she hoped her intended was as good looking as these two. While she was deep in thought the lawyer Jasper who brought her out for Clyde came around the bend, and said I'm sorry Clarissa your intended couldn't wait for you and he got married a couple of days ago, &#34;What am I supposed to do now&#34; I have no money and I can't go back to New York. Logan piped up, hey we don't have a bride either how about you spend the day with us and see if you would like to marry me. Jasper got all indignant and said &#34;no you don't want to get involved with these two they are looking for something different&#34;, Derick said be quite Jasper let the lady decide. In the mean time Derick moved in close to Clarissa and said if you marry Logan you get me as your husband as well, she looked up shocked, but thought about it and said okay I'll spend the day with you. So as they started to walk away, she said okay I'll marry you, so they stopped at the church and Logan married Clarissa and she became Mrs. Granger. Read this book because you will laugh, cry and cum a whole lot. It takes a lot for a person to give up everything and get on a train and travel for several days or weeks to the middle of know where and marry somebody sight unseen. I'm looking forward to reading the next two books in this series.",1
"I expected a typical mindless military scifi action story, and that's how this book starts.  Then, it becomes a survival tale with a little mystery.  This story delivered more than I expected, and I enjoyed it more for that.The story follows six members of a Marine special ops team as they spearhead an assault on an enemy outpost on a distant world.  When they are cut off from their extraction point, they end up stranded deep underground where they find a huge derelict spaceship.  As they try to treat their injuries, resupply and seek a means of escape, they find that they are not alone.Almost all of the action is concentrated in the beginning and end of the book, but when the action starts, it is intense.  That's not to say that much of the book is dull as writer Michael Marks manages to drive the story with suspense and mystery.  The Marines' exploration of the ship reminded me of the scene in the movie Aliens where the Colonial Marines stalk through a deserted colony.  Marks writes well - his descriptions are very detailed.  Descriptions of the Marines' gear are also very detailed - enough to make them plausible, not outlandish.  Marks doesn't skimp on the science either.  The science behind the tech in the story is explained well - it's not the techiest that I've read, but it's enough to make it believable.I do have some gripes.  First of all, the characters are too cliched and not well developed.  Only one of the characters really comes out of this adventure a different person.  Some of the characters seem to be way too tough to be real.  However, thinking of all the stories of heroism and sacrifice by special forces soldiers, maybe it isn't so far fetched.  Some of the plot points were just a little too contrived.In all, I enjoyed this book very much, and I look forward to reading more from Michael Marks.",1

Well, after a brief word from the ""sponser"" (author).The meager 39% dedicated to the ""hero"" is a TELL - nothing shown.  Though with the length I suppose there was no alternative for the writer.When I got this a while ago, it was not listed in Christian.  The one sentence description says ""redemption"" - but in a mystery /thriller (which this is listed under genre wise) that could hold meaning other than someone finding God.  It is not uncommon for teasers and word play - rather than literal intrepretation in such genre.  So, I was not expecting such a Christian heavy work.  That said, it was fine once I realized the case.  However, that is precicely what ruined the book as it became predictably obvious after the first Bible verse.  It is unfortunate as mysteries /thriller's should have some - well - mystery OR thrill.  None of either found here.But, the thing most frustrating is that this work was really just an offering to push another (more pricey) book.  While authors often push other works in some other novel - they do NOT devote 60% to that other book.There are a few punctuation errors and a couple word use issues - but was well edited.I won't try another from this author as I can buy a magazine if I want to read ads.Christine",0
"I'll admit that I struggled through the beginning of teh book. This is probably why I am not the biggest fan of backstory's in a book. It ends up being a boring information dump. But it was a dump that Lena Matthews quickly dug herself out of it. What I do like about this story is that Shane and Paige have a believable chemistry. I am a firm believer in no relationship do-overs but after reading this story, there might be an upside to second chances.",1
"i have to say, id never read any of biance d'arc's books before, this was recommended to me and im so glad it was, a brilliant story with characters, you'll fall in love with.this is the first book in the series, and after reading this book i went out and bought the rest of the books",1
"I love Karen's writing, I have to say I am not bi-curious in any way, and this book just didn't do it for me.I am really more into the heterosexual boy meets girl romance.",0
I only read about two pages of this book and thought it was terrible. I hated the stupid descriptions of the characters movements and was just annoyed at the writing. Don't waste your time.,0
"I bought this thinking it was another book, but it is more like a description of a scene.  It describes the main character's reception at his girlfriend's family's gathering and that's about it.  It builds tension but doesn't do anything with it.Shame on the author for touting this as a short story.  Shame on the author, also, for hiding the fact beneath a wall of text.",0
"As the second son of the Earl of Warren, Captain Dylan Blake has always been made to feel unloved and unwanted.  After the last ten years fighting for his country he's come home a hero, but even his heroic accomplishments have done nothing to earn his fathers acceptance or love.  Irritated and at loose ends he is goaded by an old adversary to a wager; if he can get the elusive Lady Natalia Sinclair to dance two dances with him in one evening, he'll win two hundred pounds. Needing the funds, Dylan takes on the challenge.Feeling her huge dowry is her only attractive feature, Lady Natalia has found it extremely difficult to trust.  Reading and following the heroic deeds of Captain Dylan Blake - Natalia had built Dylan up into a dashing hero.  Unfortunately when she finally met him, she wasn't charmed and rejected his initial request for a dance.Discovering that his father had ordered his older brother Michael to win her hand, Dylan is determined not to come in second place again. Initiating a campaign to win Natalia's heart, Dylan loses his and just as Natalia is ready to admit to her love, the details of his ""wager"" come to light.  Would Natalia's broken trust be too big an obstacle for the two awakened hearts to overcome?***  Tracy Seybold writing as Diana Bold has once again captivated me with her skillful blend of intriguing plots and intelligent characters. My only problem with this story was that I started it too late in the evening and had trouble putting it down - so much so that after much tossing and turning, I to get up and finish it!Bold fashioned Dylan as a very compelling and intriguing man terribly hurt by his inability of having his father demonstrate any loving kindness towards him except in the form of disgust.  After ten years of heroic fighting Dylan sold his commission quickly running through his funds.  Knowing it would infuriate his father Dylan showed up late for a fete and his father cut off him off financially which partly explains his drunken error as to how he was so easily goaded into a wager - a wager which in itself was actually quite innocent.  Just have the very snooty daughter of a duke dance twice in one night with him.  Having caught the lady's eye earlier in the evening Dylan was sure of his charm and utterly shocked when the seeming star struck young woman refused to dance with him.Natalia was a victim of low self-esteem.  At school she'd been the victim of jealousy, and made to think that the only attractive thing about her was her huge dowry.  As a young impressionable girl this peer pressure marked her and wariness of anyone who tried to get close. Having followed Dylan's exploits of heroism during the war, Natalia was infatuated with the hero, but not enough to fall at his feet.  It wasn't until she had a chance to get to know and talk to him that she was able to understand and begin to trust; especially when she realized that he sought  the very same thing as she - someone who really cared.",1
This is a short short story that I assume sets the scene for future stories and it does this really well. You get a good picture of the club and what it's like and who it's for. It  introduces the characters. We first meet Brett and Lisa and find out a bit about them and how they feel about one another and then Leo enters the mix. We find out Lisa and Leo have a past. The three spend the night together which manages to not just be hot but tender and loving as well. The story ends with their journey together beginning. It was well done. A good read.,1
"In this short short uh story(?)a woman is supposedly trying to win a contest and use her winnings eventually for school. While dancing she is 'turned on' by the handsome man who is entranced by her but for reasons of his own. A sexual fairy tale with a gargoyle who wants to be freed from a curse. Okay. No background about the contest, the girl or the gargoyle and his curse. Great sex under less than pleasant circumstances, 'Love is a many splendid thing', I guess.  It's more like a warped beauty and the beast gone wrong. This short story could be remnants of several of the writer's dreams. You could call it quirky if it had a real beginning but it starts in the middle and ends. It held my interest when it read it, hoping that more would be explained but that didn't happen. Lap Dance is too short in length and many other aspects of a good short story in this or any other genre.Worth the price as is and the 5 minutes it takes to read it. It was free and readable. I think the writer can do better and I hope she does.",0
"Dee crafts an exciting story of time travel and love with ""Under A Viking Moon."" Katla 'Kat' Jonsdottir and Leif Nabboddrson are two people destined never to meet until a time traveling pendant brings them together. Can the sparks that have ignited between them keep the couple together?Dee's writing is exciting. The story immediately grabs the reader's attention and doesn't let go. The story plot is tight.

But Cullen has A Better Idea - she can stay with him as His Mate. Can they overcome the Eagle Clan's bullying and unfair challenges to get their own HEA?Comments:- Contemporary paranormal erotic romance.- 2155 kindle locations, 29,674 words but finishes around 1897 locations.- m/f - explicit, reasonably frequent.- ""In Plain Sight"" would pretty much stand alone, however characters from previous book play a role.- We met Sarah in Book1 - she's the waitress who came on to Burke.- Includes excerpts fromRachel's Totemby Marie Harte,Theirs To Captureby Shelli Stevens andTemptation Unleashedby Kari Thomas.Opinion:I liked it. It was a different take on shape shifting with eagles and interesting ""pack"" dynamics. Unfortunately, I don't think the author quite pulled off the sub-characters, particularly Mum Sheila; they were a little too one-dimensional. I just didn't take to them.3.5 stars rounded down. It's a good addition to the series, populating the shifter town with clever characters, and setting up a nice World for future books. But it isn't quite there yet.-CR-",0
I enjoyed this book so much that I read it in a single setting. The book was so hot it made you consider making that late night phone call or waking up the husband. Read this book and tell your friends too.,1
"Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down. Jim Richards is a recently unemployed security guard, living with his parents and has just turned 60. While he wishes his life had afforded better opportunities, it is convenient living there so he can help his Mother with his ailing Father.One night Jim receives an e-mail from an old high school friend asking for him to call, that she needs his help. When he picks up the phone and calls, he is greeted on the other end by a police officer informing him his friend had been murdered. Jim is stunned by this revelation and wonders what is going on?He contacts his long time cohort, Buck who convinces him he needs to look into things. As things progress and Jim and Buck are still befuddled, another classmate is murdered! What is going on?? Who is targeting Jim's classmates and why? Jim finally figures out the pattern of the killings and he and Buck go out of their way to protect the people they think are listed for murder.It turns out this is no ordinary murderer, but a very brave and cunning one, who will even make their kills with the police present. How can Jim and Buck protect anyone from such a brutal killer??I really enjoyed reading The Classmate Murders. I love the senior citizen hero, Jim Richards and also like to see our love lives will not end after 40. I even snuck this book to work with me to read at lunchtime. One of my favorite things about the book, is that the character's seemed so real to me, as if you could run into any of them on the streets and enjoy meeting them. A great combination of murder, thrills, romance and excitement. I highly recommend reading The Classmate Murders by Bob Moats. I just ordered ""The Vegas Showgirl Murders"" by Bob Moats.  I hope I enjoy it as well!",1
"Great novella, quick read and smoking hot as usual by Elle Kennedy! Good story. Don't miss out on another great story!!",1

"Call me crazy but I have a hard time believing that any woman who is tied up, gagged and abused would be declaring her undying love for one of her abusers by the time they'd finished with her. If Matt is so kind, loving and crazy about Savannah then why does he let her first sexual experience be so degrading, painful and down right abusive? Really ladies is that the kind of man you would want to spend the rest of your life with? As soon as Savannah walks in to Matts boardroom and he starts to frighten her by ripping her clothes off and getting physical I found myself getting turned off by both characters. At one point Savannah is being abused by two men at once, she is crying so hard that snot is running down her face yet Matt stands there and lets them carry on. Oh yeah he's a keeper. I have to confess to skipping the rest of the book after that and just reading the end and of course it was as predictable as I expected. Savannah is lying in Matts arms begging him never to leave her and they start to plan their wedding while having the most earth shattering sex (virgins take note, your first time will not under any circumstances be that good!) ever. Ah just what every girl dreams of.",0

I had high hopes when I started reading this book. It started out slow and then it got worse. Frankly I don't know why I kept on reading I was hoping it would get better. A total waste of time.,0
"First off for the spell checkers out there. When I read I read the story and not the words and especially not the individual letters. The purpose of writing a story is too take your reader on a trip. I thought Mr. Morris did a great job of telling me a story. When you tell a story you OFTEN don't use the perfect verbiage that you might use in your doctoral dissertation. That is because it is a story and SHOULD be told in the voice of the people in the story. I also am a writer AND I live in the South. I often use words like y'all and ain't in my stories. I'm sorry if it is offensive but that is the way the people in my stories often talk. A person from Boston or whatever might even say &#34;you'se guys&#34;.The story is about TEENAGERS! Post pubescent kids have sex drives and that is just the way it is. THAT is reality. I thought he handled it both realistically and with good taste. Actually I think if he had gone for a more realistic handling of this it would have included a LOT more sexual tension and activity.Some people don't think that it is realistic that kids this age COULD deal with things like this as well as these kids did. Let me tell you, My Dad graduated high-school when he was 15. WW2 was in high gear and he couldn't enlist because he was too young. He went to Dallas and worked in an aircraft factory for a year and then enlisted in the Navy the day after his 16th birthday. His Grandfather was in the trenches in France when he was that age. One ancestor fought at Shiloh in the Civil War when he was 14! Another died at the battle of San Jacento when Texas defeated the Mexicans and earned our freedom. He was 17! Just because we don't ask a lot of kids these days does NOT mean that they can't do amazing things.Sex...Dale Evans, Roy Rogers wife got married the first time when she was 12. Laura Engels Wilder (Little House on the prairie) eloped and married at 12 also. A lot of &#34;kids&#34; in the past were &#34;adults&#34; at a very young age. I have no doubt that if today&#8217;s kids were tossed in the fire they would adapt, grow up and deal.The story was engaging and well worth reading. The characters were interesting and attractive. I finished it and immediately bought the next one and loved it too. I'm hoping for more...",1

"I wanted to like this book, having loved reading and bookstores my entire life. But the book isn't about someone who loves reading or bookstores. I got tired of all the clueless people, the sermons on the evils of electronic books causing the extinction of all bookstores. The irony of reading this in Kindle format especially when a similar device called a Gizmo from an online purveyor called the Nile was a focus of this book finally got to me. I was just too bored to continue reading. Oh, I gave it every chance to reawaken my interest by reading the final chapter. What I discovered was that removing the book from my device was inevitable.",0

"This book is useful to beginners.  Maybe.  It is a compilation of small essays that do not go in depth and tend to be more amusing than helpful.  In fact, most of this advice can be gleaned from a few Google searches.  If you truly need help with your craft, check out the books by Stephen King, David Morrell, Sol Stein (even though he is a snob and selfish self-promoter), Betsey Lerner, and Ralph Keyes.  You will get a plethora of ideas from those professionals.  Guaranteed.  This book feels like a quaint magazine article in a writing magazine.  As we know, we get roped into reading them and come out with barely an insight.",0
"This book is wrong on so many levels and although I don't usually type spoilers I will for this one..Hope is the daughter of one of the scientists at the lab Wolfe is held at. Although he marks her, he refuses to mate her because of her age. The labs burn down and Wolfe is believed dead for  years. Hope is alone and unable to move on with another man because of the bond.Hope's evil mother apparently knows Wolfe survived because she has been sending him photos of Hope with other men. (Fake of course). Wolfe appears out of nowhere, captures Hope, and punishes her by teasing her with sex, and not allowing orgasms. Due to the mating heat she is apparently writhing in pain while he continues to try getting the answers he seeks.If you find nothing wrong with the above, it gets worse!First time for her and he sticks it in her ass.When he finally out of no where does a 180 and decides she is innocent, he doesn't want to to relieve her because he might be to rough and his animal is at the surface!? What?!Of course she begs, they have their orgasms, and all is forgiven. There's some joking. And then her mother shows up for a quick (falling sandbags of all things) take down.This is a joke, the writing is just (not even good ) sex with some attempts at a story thrown in.",0
"I feel that this author used a thesaurus simply because another reviewer suggested it.  Not all uses of a thesaurus are needed.. the misuse of the word concertino I think was just to much.  The book is poorly edited and just reading what one wrote could have fixed many of the problems.Next I'd like to add that I don't care how much of a hymen a women has left by the time she is in her twenties hell even as a teenager you CAN NOT tell if she is a virgin by a ""popping"" or how hard it was to press pass something.  Inexperience in the woman's body and in sex really gets to me.  If you are not grown up enough to know about this subject don't write about it.  Hell as a freshman in high school we were taught in our health class exactly how a woman's hymen works..  If one is female they should know this, if one is male and not old enough to know this they shouldn't be writing sex scenes.Next the in such a short book the sex scene should not span 12% of the book, for one scene.  Either write supernatural fantasy fiction, or write smut.. not very many authors can do this..  This is just another case of how in a short story people fall desperately in love with each other at first sight.. and the name.. really.. people should stay away from the name Isabella or Bella in werewolf or vampire books right now.. gives people a bad taste of the Twilight books, which were NOT good books.",0
"The story was well written and flowed well.  It was a fast read but I just personally HATED Shana, the major female character.  Strong women in romances I like but Shana was more the agressive-you-want-to-wring-her-neck type of woman.  Even the reason for her behavior that was revealed by the author was not enough to make me like her even a little bit. And the female characters from the first story in the series are back but their pathetic submission and fear of Shana made me dislike them too. Except for a couple of them, these females were too much like lionesses and not enough like human females with spines. Still for the price of the Kindle book (I got it for less than $3), try it out for yourself and see if you feel the same way I do.",0
"While the story has promise it was a difficult read.  The author needs to work on the craft of writing. Many rookie grammar, spelling and storytelling mistakes were distracting.  While in some cases the characters were hundreds of years old they didn't seem to have evolved beyond the consciousness of high schoolers.  Characterizations were also a bit inconsistent.  Political intrigue is not very sophisticated and the ways characters stow away and otherwise sneak around to avoid detection stretches credulity.  I also didn't appreciate descriptions such as ""The Latina woman"", ""the Asian"", or ""the dark man"" to describe every character who wasn't White.  In the meantime, what I assume are white characters had not such descriptions.  I appreciate the attempt but the author needs training.",0
The best thing about this series is the fact that it could be neverending :) There are always more stories to tell when it involves surviving the Zombie Apocalypse.,1
"The details of Lincoln's death watch have been well publicised . The words of the  attending physician seemed to solicit assurance that he did all that could be done to extend the President' s life . It is written with  a tone of confidence, yet underlying is an uneasiness , a doubt, that his treatment could be questioned.",0
"This is a short story, but a complete story (which isn't always true).  There was enough history of the characters and society to make it all understandable.  Would recommend.",1
Is this the last book in a series? I feel like I was missing a lot especially when the other couples were in the storyline. It was like I was supposed to who they were. It got very annoying. I also hate that the heroine forgave the hero's insult so fast. I would not have.,0
I probably would have given it four stars but there were a lot of grammatical and punctuation errors that at times made me stop and have to reread. I am not a grammar Nazi so that is saying something. The other thing was it started a little hard as he had to introduce a large cast. This story had a lot of thought put into it though so it was worth it. I enjoyed the twist on special zombie powers which I won't describe so I don't ruin it for others. All in all I have to say this was a pretty good book way above others in its genre.,0
"This divorced couple brushed their many serious issues under the rug just because of their physical attraction for each other. Get real, there's a reason they got divorced.",0

"Briony Swift is a college math professor.  Her life is ordered and calculated and well, boring.  She flies the straight and narrow and can't remember the last time she did anything fun or risqu&eacute;.  Not the type of person to draw attention to herself, Briony knows that the hidden attraction she feels for two of her students is totally wrong and refuses to explore her feelings.  When the two men in question, Nic Potter and Leo Phelps, come to her office to get her to sign a form, all bets are off because once her name is on their drop/add slips, these two men are no longer her students.  And that scares Briony most of all.Two Plus One is a risqu&eacute; and rambunctious romp of erotic goodness.  Leo and Nic are naughty but nice and they are exactly what Briony needed in her life.  Briony needed them in her life and they were good for her as well as good to her.  The sex is hot, the love scenes emotional and the storyline engaging.  I really liked Two Plus One - other readers will as well.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1

"It is very frustrating to see authors/publishers loading part of a story for free and then selling you the follow-up pieces.  Free books should be free.  If you want to give me a free sample of a book, then be honest about it in the description.  This ""book"" ends right in the middle of a conversation.It isn't even very good.  Jane Porter takes a vow of celibacy after finding out that her ""master"" is married (I put that in quotation marks because that is what she calls him, but she seems to be very unfamiliar with the lifestyle later in the story - it was difficult to figure out exactly what her experience level was).  After a year, she attends a BDSM-themed party she set up as a party planner.  This whole turn of events was so incredibly unrealistic.  First of all, a guy was throwing it for his half-brother.  Who throws a party like that for a  sibling?  Nobody in the book was engaging in any sort of negotiation or conversation about what they wanted to do.  It was just guys throwing their weight around while mouthing bland inane nothings like ""You know that a submissive is really in charge of the scene?""  Well, if that's the case, then maybe try talking about what she wants, what she is looking for in the scene, what isn't on the table for the session?  The whole reason Jane got into a bad situation in the first place was because she didn't talk to her ""master,"" but she's going to get right back into that same mistake again?  This was like somebody's poorly thought out fantasy, not anything close to how this would play out in real life.",0

". NO SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 2 in the Wicked series that starts withWicked Sexy: Wicked, Book 1that is set in a world of witches (Magians) who mate into threesomes. A fun premise from a talented author, I'm excited to see where the series goes... but not thrilled so far. This book was a disappointment all around. If this was another author, perhaps a new author, I might give it 3 stars, but because it's Alexander I'm giving it 2 because we all know she can do better in her sleep. If you aren't familiar with her work yet- PLEASE don't start here! I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea! Maybe her Children of the Goddess series linked below.PLOT: There really wasn't any coherent plot- just a series of unfortunate events. The pacing was choppy. There was no build up of of tension- sexual or otherwise. Kidnapping is a tough angle to work into a romance. It takes skill to create an opportunity for a girl to forgive that kind of thing, but here there was no compelling reason for Harrison to do so. (Kresley Cole and Gena Showalter are two authors who excel at turning that kind of thing around.) I'm not even sure I understood what the hell happened during the resolution of the main conflict. Harrison's extreme need for independence was never properly embraced. It was as if this was merely a ploy to get the story started and then turned into a trivial event- perhaps even a childish one. I was really disappointed in that aspect.ROMANCE: There was no development along these lines either. Three attractive people... some hot, but quick sex... a few paragraphs of back story to give them each a little history... then BAM, all of a sudden happily ever after? No working together, no winning each other over, no endearing moments? Nope, not feeling it- which is a real shame because I usually love the threesome set up. This had potential over book 1 because unlike book 1, the men here were romantically involved with each other.CHARACTERS: What characters? Were there characters, because I might have missed that... Sarcasm aside, our girl Harrison had a lot of potential and I felt like the lack of plot stomped all over her. Jacob and Ric were little more than spoiled, arrogant underwear models with magic. Not even sure if either of them had jobs or hobbies.BOTTOM LINE: This wasn't offensive, but barely worth reading. There are still some fun moments here, but overall a disappointment. If you are a fan of Alexander, then I recommend just reading it because I STILL have faith this series will get better.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. R.G. Alexander's steamy vampire/were/witch romance series:Regina in the Sun (Children of the Goddess)2. Moira Rogers' magically diverse romance seriesCrux: Southern Arcana, Book 13. Anya Bast'sWitch Fire (Elemental Witches, Book 1)- sweet, sexy para-romance with witches, demons and more4. Dana Marie Bell'sDare to Believe (The Gray Court)- sexy para-romance with all manner of fae: Sidhe, dragons, leprechauns, vampires and more.5. Kresley Cole's adventurous  and intricate magical romance series (never mind the ridiculous title):A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)6. Jacquelyn Frank'sJacob (The Nightwalkers, Book 1)- demons, were, vamps and other fae finding their better halves in races that should be the enemy7. Larissa Ione'sPleasure Unbound (Demonica, Book 1)- demon centric romance series that sets up a demon-run hospital under a human city. Not as well written as the others.8. Sherrilyn Kenyon'sFantasy Lover- Dark Hunter series with shifters, vamps and Greek gods. The first book is not as good as the rest- it just gets better and better.9. J.R. Ward'sDark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, Book 1)- also darker, more violent and incredibly intense vampire romance series. Vampires protect the world from evil. Vivid glimpses into the evil perspective as well.10. Lara Adrian's Kiss of Midnight (The Midnight Breed, Book 1) - also darker, more violent, but incredibly intense. Vampires protect the world from their evil brethren.",0

"Characters are two dimensional (that's being generous) and inconsistent. Characters are also extremely unrealistic. If this is due to the phenomena of people writing a book like they would if it were a script, this would be a horrible box office flop, or most likely a really bad straight-to-dvd with no cult following.Parts of story *of course every author just HAS to put in a ""twist""* are thrown in pointlessly (""We have a great revelation to tell you! It has nothing to do with the story, but we'll talk about it for 5 pages incoherently and unrealistically!""). Little side bits not very well developed and transitions between scenes are painful. Think Old Spice commercial. No offense to Old Spice Guy.Basically it just boils down to really bad writing and not being able to add all the elements together in a way that gives a good cohesive story. It goes from being interesting (originally interesting premise) to being not cared about at all.",0
"Can't say that I made it more than 1/2 way through trying to force myself to read on. Since then, when I think about this book, the only word that comes to mind is ""DUH"".  Just couldn't find anything funny with all the silly slang talk along the way.  I found it difficult to stay focused and have decided that I have completed my final chapter in this one.",0
"Orphaned Wiley had a hard life, unceremoniously abandoned as a child and having to cope that she transforms into an ugly hairy unknown creature when she feels very intense emotions. Well, her life was about to become harder when she stumbles across others of her own kind, one of which is a hot prince who happens to be her betrothed!The book starts off well enough and I quite like the author's writing style. The plot in this book is similar to The Charmer, except told from the perspective of Wiley. If so, it would have been expected that there would have been more plot, or additional twist and turns to give life to this novel. Unfortunately, this was not to be, you ocassionally had word for word replication of certain scenes in The Charmer. The major flaw in this book was that it turned out to be a unconcluded short novel and ended with a ""Read The Charmer to find out how it all ends!""WHAT?!?!?!?!You have got to be kidding me! Short story + overlap in plot + no conclusive ending?!?!?!?! Especially when this novel is $2.99, which is more expensive than the other books in the Darkland series!! If this was made clear in the product description (that it's a prologue or short prequel to The Charmer), I would not feel so disgruntled. Save your money and read The Charmer (a really good novel) which has a much stronger plot and is cheaper to boot!",0
"3 short stories (although one is more akin to a novelette) in one reasonably priced volume that really delivers!I thoroughly enjoyed the adventures of Wistril, Kern, and Sir Knobby. Easily some of the most enjoyable short fiction that I have read in quite a long while. Humor, adventure and fantasy with a real beginning, middle and end. Well written and very entertaining.Anxiously awaiting the day that Mr. Tuttle sees fit to write a novel length Wistril & Co. adventure. As good as this short fiction was, it certainly left me wanting more of this wonderful character and his friends.",1

"If you love the passion, the romance and the deeply intelligent dialogue of Regency Romance you won't like this book. The characters in this book, while intriguing, are horribly written. The supporting characters, supposedly two upstanding gentleman of the ton, speak as if they are dockside workers. The dialogue in the entire book lacks charisma and is choppy. The book takes you over dips and turns that have no part in the story. A VERY difficult book to force myself through. Save your time, you can never get it back!",0

"Sickly Edwin is on a train, traveling with his mother and sister to his sister's fianc&eacute;, when he begins to have odd dreams.  Then he meets the magician, Satori, and things get even stranger.  With a history of spells of black despair, Edwin can't be sure if his attraction to the strange magician is real or not...Sleight of Hand is an odd and hot paranormal tale in which things are not as they seem.  Katrina Strauss did an excellent job of evoking an atmosphere that was mysterious, and even a little spooky.  I couldn't always determine what was reality and what wasn't right away, which kept me reading to find out.  It was easy to sympathize with fragile, earnest Edwin.  Satori was a bit harder to get a handle on.  His motives were murky and although he clearly wanted Edwin, I wasn't sure I bought that he loved him.  There's a big twist at the end that sort of explains Satori's behavior, and quite a few other things.  Overall, Sleight of Hand's hot, kind of creepy vibe held my interest, and I enjoyed the story.  While the romance part might not have been the most convincing I've read, Sleight of Hand was certainly a memorable and page-turning tale.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
Loved the story line. It was a great book. The only problem I have with it was it was just to short,1
"If you were a man who only had one night once every twenty years or so to find your true love, somebody who could value you for what lies beyond your appearance, would you spend part of that night in a strip club getting a lap dance?  My guess would be no.Too much was unexplained in this story.  What was the contest that the female main was participating in (she kept talking about getting a sports car, so I guess that was the prize)?  What was the story with him being in the club in the first place?  What about the curse?  I guess this is part of a larger series, but it utterly fails to stand alone.",0
"This author rarely disappoints me.  Of all the Naughty Games books, I wanted to read this one the most.  And it was worth it.Rich boy Shane Oxley has it bad for Paige Reyes.  They'd been great friends in college along with their group of five other best friends.  And had remained great fiends even years later.  But Paige had gotten engaged and Shane had to act fast to make sure she didn't get married.But he miscalculated -- badly.  And their one night of passion ended  -- badly.  Paige has been avoiding him and their once close friendship has gone down the toilet.Now on the occasion of his birthday party, Shane had maneuvered his close group of friends to his home for some truth telling and relationship repairing.  His shamelessly uses his power to get Paige back into his orbit and maybe, just maybe,  he can dare her give him another chance.Shane was cute and so determined. Paige was hurt and so in love.  This was a two-character book.  Just the two of them hashing out their issues with some great dialogue and smoking hot love scenes.Sometimes that is all you need.",1
"The story is set in England, along the Dorset coast.  Our main character, Martin, is out in a boat one day and encounters a pair of dolphins (who knew there were dolphins in England??).  Some days later when a storm blows up unexpectedly, the dolphins come to Martin's aid when his boat engine fails.It turns out, the dolphins are a rare strain of shifters, who are born dolphin but can assume the form of a human.  The pair - George and Patrick - have come to like and trust Martin and they eventually share their secret with him.  For the dolphins, some abilities carry through each form, such as echolocation, and various quirky mating habits.  The latter comes up when the pair proposition Martin and he isn't shy about taking them up on the offer.  This isn't strictly m&eacute;nage sex; for the trio, it's generally two of the guys, then two others in succession.  And after the first day, the sex very much moves into the background of the story.Because then, the story turns to Martin's interest in an abandoned house along the coastline, and we follow along - in detail - as he talks with the owner, and arranges to lease and fix up the place.  We spend WAAAAAY too much time pursuing cellar passageways, and cleaning windows, and checking wiring.  Chapters are spent describing arranging for a surveyor to come out, and inspection of the septic tank, and buying appliances.  This degenerated into a DIY project that went on forEVER.  This was a long book - more than 4000 location - but the middle 2000 was about fixing up this house.And then, there's the bestiality subplot that brings sex back in towards the end of the story.  See, the dolphin guys would be keen to have sex with Martin while they are in dolphin form, even though that would require Martin being underwater during the whole thing, and potentially harmful penetration by a dolphin-sized penis.  Martin is VERY not comfortable with the idea, and it takes quite awhile to work up to things.  Even the dolphins are concerned about harming Martin - it's mentioned that the activity could even prove fatal if things went badly - but that doesn't dissuade anyone.  When they eventually Do the Deed, it is REALLY not sexy or erotic and I spent most of the time trying to avert my eyes, simply because of how the whole thing was written.Ultimately, this is a very ""English"" book.  Rather straight-laced English characters, English dialogue, very conservatively-paced proper storytelling.  In a word, it was boring.  Not bad, just too much time spent on stilted conversations and detailed home repair.  In the end, Martin and George and Patrick have rather decided to pursue a relationship of three, though it's never much discussed, and there are no declarations of strong feelings - let alone love!  The story kind of pans away at the end and a lot of things are just left unresolved.  But hopefully not to leave room for a sequel, because I - at least - would not be buying that!",0
"I know this is the first book in a trilogy, but as such, I expect there to be enough material to understand the basics of the story! In this first story, I was very confused my the different characters, aside from the main two (Zyra, Molly). The basic plot and understood it was that Molly had something and Zyra was going after her. This story had a lot of loose ends which were not described well enough to make sense. The action scene was written horribly, full of overly technical terminology and too much detail. Aside from the weak cliffhanger ending, there's nothing here that made me feel like continuing the trilogy.",0
Great books for the price. You can read them together or separate.  You will laugh and make guess and over all enjoy the books,1
"Ok book, not one of mb's best.  But good light reading.  After a while they all follow a pattern.  If this is the story line you are looking for it is good read.",1
"Greg McKenzie is a guy who could be your neighbor. He works, he loves his wife and accompanies her to church. He's trying to quit smoking, hold his temper and not swear too much.Then suddenly, just home from a church-sponsored trip to the Holy Land, he and his wife, Jill, find themselves in the middle of a situation that could ignite World War 3.The plot reminds me somewhat of Hitchcock's Man Who Knew Too Much. The stories aren't the same, but there's that same tension and consequences for a character thrust into a situation involving a foreign culture and a place outside his normal life.Campbell builds the reader's sympathy for Greg and Jill McKenzie--they're a likeable couple, one we'd enjoy spending time with--and you want to see them get out of this dire situation.There's plenty of action as Greg, a man with a background in law enforcement, races against time to rescue his wife and avert an international tragedy. It keeps the reader flipping pages. We want to know what happens next and how they're going to be reunited.This was the first in a series and a good place to start if you're unfamiliar with Campbell's work. Good characterization, smooth plotting and even a touch of humor.",1
Another great story from Ms. Kallysten.  I will admit that I wasn't as big of a fan of Lisa as I was of the of two. I normally like really strong confident women but she was just a little too sure of her self for me.  As usual the sex in this was extremely hot and very well written. She does really well with making you connect with her characters in such a short time. I look forward to more in this series.,1
"Pride and Prejudicemash-ups, retellings, sequels, and spin-offs are big business.  This is a retelling of the classic set in a world where there are all sorts of were-creatures.  Although multiple scenes from the original are incorporated into the text, you can really see where the seams are.  One example would be grafting a ""Three Company's""-worthy subplot to keep Elizabeth and Darcy apart.  Instead of the wit, wordplay, and charm of the original, we've got Elizabeth turning down Darcy's proposal because she thinks he's gay.  It isn't homophobic -- just witless.The plot, such as it is, is heavily reliant on action.  I found myself missing the acidic and pragmatic Elizabeth and Darcy more with every page.  Instead we've got these second-rate copies mooning over each other.  I know that instant true love at first eyelock is the current paranormal trend . . . but there is something so amazing about how Elizabeth and Darcy come, in the original, to slowly realize their feelings for each other.  There is a reason some books are classics and others are quickly forgotten.",0
"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble, this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night, the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time, (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner",1
I started reading it but quit because I really didn't like it.  I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea.,0
"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsA semi interesting back-story and I didn't care for the writing style. For some reason I had expected something way more intense since there seems to be so much buzz about the Lords of the Underworld series. To me the writing seemed kind of amateurish. I'm going to give the rest of the books a chance though because I did buy The Darkest Fire as part of a Lords of the Underworld bundle package and I am curious on the relevance of this prequel.Regarding the hero in the story, as admirable as Geryon was, the description of hooves, fur and horns was a big turn off. I just wasn't feeling the draw at all. Even creepy as he seemed more animal than human.The idea that Pandora's box was built from a Goddess' bones was really cool and I think that I may have enjoyed The Darkest Fire more if I had read it after the first book in the series, The Darkest Night. Perhaps I could have appreciated the importance of Pandora's box more. As for the The Darkest Fire being a stand alone little story; I'd not suggest reading it alone and then giving up. More forward with The Darkest Night and then make your decision if you liked it or not. Since I went ahead and read The Darkest Night right away, that moved my rating for this book from a 2 to a 3. (which is a big rating difference)Teasers: cracked wall to hell, Lords of the Underworld,  Goddess of Oppression, Guardian to Hell's Gate",0

"There are a lot of good tips in this blog - how to do something, free book alerts, etc.  The author puts in a lot of time with this blog and there are usually 2-3 posts per weekday, although the weekend seems a little thin.  The how to's, etc. are invaluable to me and I hoep he keeps pumping them out.However, I get turned off at times with this blog with the endless self-promotion of his own book titles and what comes across as arrogance on prognostications and how evil the book publishers are: many times, I have read the same thing on someone else's blog which makes me wonder if I am getting a regurgitation / paraphrase with a self-congratulatory pat on the back.  If he toned this part down, he would probably have 2x however many subscribers there are now.Overall, this is certainly worth a buck per month!",0
Not the best of Jill shalvis. I love most of her books but this one didn't make the cut. Check out her other books if you like susan mallery.,0

"Great book packed full with fast cars , crazy hot men, and danger... and oh yes great sex!",1
This book could have been a great story but I did not read passed about ten chapters before I skipped to the last chapter. The language in this book is terrible and trashy. A lack of proper English was very evident. There is nothing wrong with cleanliness in one's speech.,0
"Not for me.  When I think, J.A. Konrath, I think of an author who has successfully gone Indie.  So I was hoping for some insightful information and practical advice for an Indie author.  Instead, I came up short, which is rather spectacular since this is about 370,000 words!!!  This is a compilation of blog posts and it is seriously outdated.  Has the publishing world changed so quickly?  I guess it has.  I mean he has several chapters about MYSPACE!!  Much of this is geared toward an author who already has a publishing deal or an agent and the rest would have been helpful 5 years ago. So for an Indie like myself, this was a waste of time.",0
"A fun, hot and fast reading.What I liked:* The way the two characters, Mav and Duke, surrendered to their attraction. Mav is confused, but he's not waiting for things to happen to him, at a certain point he schemes to get things between him and Duke in motion.* The gay-chicken escalation from vanilla gay-chicken to extreme gay-chicken. It was really funny and I can't stop grinning like a fool just thinking about it.What I didn't like:* The epilogue. I could have done without it. It's one of the rare books where I was totally satisfied before the epilogue, so maybe this is a compliment.* At one point Duke reacts to something Mav says in a way that it felt too over the top for me.I should give this book 3 stars, but it gets 4 because I couldn't put it down and I even had to go back to read one of the scenes after I finished the book because it was just too hot.",1
"I read this and felt the tears coming. How moving. I'm not certain if it was just me being overly emotional, but this book lead me to tear up and weep along with the stories.I've always imagined that I would be reached by loved ones and that they would send me the message that is necessary for my moment - a moment of encouragement. What a true blessing (and I don't use that b word much) for those to have received such a gift. Reading about it gives clarity, insight, and hope, so I can imagine that those who are actually touched by these events must be clearer about life and living.",1
"I like Joe Hill's other books/stories and looked forward to this Kindle short-""My Father's Mask"". Wow, was I ever disappointed. If you want to read a story that seems to be the beginning of a book that is never solidified or brought to any semblance of a conclusion, then this one is for you. And I enjoy ""quirky"" stories, ones that don't give the reader the expected outcome (such as the O. Henry stories) but this is just wrong. It's as if the author is trying too hard to be ""deep"", but the storyline was too strange for me to enjoy.",0
I love how the plot was formed and how the characters interacted together. Would re-read this book again very interesting.,1
"I kind of take the reviews with a grain of salt, it's subjective to each person's viewpoint. I liked other books by this author like Collision Course and No Souvenirs. I thought ok it's a short story, it can't be that bad. I was wrong, it ended at 1109 locations, 66 percent. The ending was so abrupt, it wasn't just having a few questions. It was almost as if the story stopped in the middle, I expected to get the next chapter when I turned the page and all of a sudden I am staring at the author's bio and I can't figure out what happened. I even rebooted my kindle thinking the story loaded wrong. Then spent 15 min combing through pages and pages of blurbs for other stories looking for a sequel with no luck. I have read many stories by this author, some I liked and some I didn't. However, I have never been so pissed or so disappointed and disgusted as I am now. I gave 2 stars cause the story was started so well, but there was hardly any relationship development. Just basically 2 guys with insane chemistry. If she had developed this story like the 2 books I already mentioned it would have been great. Mitchell chose the wrong story line for this short short story. I hope she revises and republished this story in a way longer format. I want to know what happens. Trust me, I have read short stories that had the perfect plot line that it could be told in a way that the reader was happy at the end. This definitely isn't it. Save your money, don't make a mistake like I did.",0
"Saskia's friend asked her to spy on her boyfriend because the guy had been getting hang ups on his cell phone. So Saskia went to a bar dressed pretty much like a hooker to try and pick up Mark, or hoped to pick up Mark her friends boyfriend.

At the bar, she spots the sexiest man she's ever seen and assumes it's Mark, but it turns out to be Andreas ""her new boss"" who she tries to pick up, and he rejects her advances.

He needs a fake fiance so his grandfather will stop trying to arrange a marriage with someone he can't stand.

"A cute idea... however I'm not sure I was too in love with the story or any of the characters. I found myself wanting to skip ahead just to see if I'd really miss anything...

"Kilborn doesn't mince words, just body parts in this engrossing short story which picks up literally where Truck Stop left off. Donaldson's god complex, thirst for blood and need for complete victim submission come to fore in Serial at the expense of a naive hitchhiker. Kilborn teams Donaldson with yet another antagonist with a fetish for the macabre whose drive is that of the more imposing serial killer yet far more unassuming. Expect terror at every turn of the road.Serial delivers on its relentless pursuit to dissuade people of picking up hitchhikers - I will never look at charred meat on the BBQ the same again as I am sure to envision the vivid and overtly graphic scenes described in this story. Sublime yet sadistic and so satisfying - 5 stars.",1

"This book was not my cup of tea.  I stopped reading at about page 50.  I found it very slow-moving with too much emphasis on minute details that weren't necessary for plot or character building.

"Menchyon Martinez is the CEO of a successful perfume company. He has a staff of capable, sexy executives, which includes his best friend, an ex lover and his sister. There is a lot going on inside the walls of Rendezvous that have nothing to do with making perfume. When someone from his past threatens to take everything he has worked hard for, Menchyon and his loyal staff will be tested as they strive to keep control of everything they worked hard to build.While I enjoy a little drama with my story, this was more like a little story with drama. It was hard to clearly identify the plot of the novel with all of the sub plots. There were several unbelievable factors that took away from the overall experience of the story. It was hard to believe that such high powered executives carried on such messy sordid affairs that always included only the people who worked within the company. All of the relationships and friendships of the main and sub characters worked at Rendezvous and all of the unfolding drama included someone known by the staff of Rendezvous. There were several instances where the scene jumped suddenly in a paragraph leaving me to read passages several times for understanding. I also found it hard to believe some of the sexual relations casually happening when characters jumped out of their established character to commit or submit to the scandalous acts.While I was not pleased with the overall structure of the book, a cleaner story line, without all of the sub characters would have made for a more enjoyable story. There are situations not resolved at the end of Loretta Walls'  ""Rendezvous,"" which leads me to believe we will see this cast of characters again. Readers who do not mind the many characters and subplots may find this story intriguing and easier to follow.",0

I had difficulty getting into this book when I tried to read it.  But I'm very picky about books so I hesitate to give any kind of review of it.  I think it was well written but the subject matter isn't one I'm usually interested in.,0
the only saving grace to this book is that i didn't pay full price to read it. so boring that i couldn't finish it. i will read just about everything but i felt no connection to the characters and even less to the plot.,0
Love this series. Love this author. Love the storyline. I will be buying every book in this series. Totally worth the money,1

Just an awesome kilndle paper. The content cannot be beaten. Great writing and all around coverage of the news. Just way too costly at $20.00 per month. $5 more than the next costliest paper.

"I read books not only because I love to read about new characters and their adventures, but also because I want to write. I am currently hard at work on the fourth rewrite of my manuscript, and some of the best places I look to for inspiration are other books. Seeing how the author flows the action, how they make the characters come alive, how they draw me in, gives me fresh ideas on how to make my own writing better. So when I read and review novels, I am not just reviewing as a reader, but also as a writer. I just wanted to add that little disclaimer before I get into my next review.Sammi Ever After, the debut novel from Soma Helmi has a great plot. Sammi, a young girl in her twenties, finds a friend from childhood and instantly falls in love, preparing to move across the world just to be with him. It's her fairy tale come true. Until she arrives at the airport only to find out she has been dumped- over an email. Fairy tale broken. When Sammi finally forces herself off her friend's couch and secures a job and new friends, she decides to take a little journey to try to search for that fairy tale ending. From London to Bali to Greece, Sammi gets tangled in sticky situations and personal revelations, and realizes that her Prince Charming may have been by her side the entire time.Like I said, I think the plot is fantastic. A great story about self-discovery and love, and I am a huge travel geek, so reading about all these destinations I hope to visit had me amped to read this story. But once I started, the writing fell flat to me. Helmi relied on flashbacks and back story when introducing characters, much that was simply not needed and unnecessary to the story. For each flashback, I felt myself became less engaged in the action. Another problem I had was the dialogue didn't seem very realistic. I don't know anyone who would actually describe someone's look aloud by saying ""His sandy blonde hair and piercing blue eyes and the way his muscles ripple..."" That could be the thoughts of someone, but for a person (especially a young girl) to describe someone else that way? It just wasn't believable for me. So as much as I would have liked this plot and the characters that came along for the ride, I do not feel the writing did the story justice.",0
"I normally try and give a book a chance regardless of the reviews.*****To the AUTHORI appreciate the hard work that you must have put into  this book but I believe it could be more way more. I know the book wasn't free and the authors takes a chance when they put their books on the free listing more readers, more reviews and more brutal honesty.******To The READERJust within the first chapter that alone tells you how this story is going to be and it's  not so good. Sydney and Jason just even reading them being intimate wasn't good. Basically within the first chapter I felt you read the beginning, middle and the end if that's even possible. Sometimes reading these paranormal romance (vampire, werewolve and immortals lately are becoming water down and it's just finding the right author, storyline with romance and a little action and excitement to keep your interest throughout a book. Dare I say this but maybe with more help and this was a short novella this could have been a good story",0
"The flow of the book is difficult for me personally. Within each long chapter, it breaks into new or the same subjects. It feels like a television show instead of an actual book. It does this so much I got bored with it. The writing and story is good...it just takes so long to push through it. Never had this problem before. Like the story line and want to know what happens...but not interested in purchasing his other books.Was not connected to the characters either.

"This was a short super quick read. I didn't find it as bad as some of the reviewers here have stated. I think it was fine for what it was. I agree had the story been longer there may have been more interesting and enticing scenes. I would have liked to learn a little more about Sera and her gifts.The entire time I was reading it I kept thinking back to Linda Howards White Out which can be found in Strangers in the Night. The premise seemed similar. Being snowed in but Howards was more of a story. I really enjoyed that one. There was at least one similar scene that while both were good this fell a little short.All in all I liked it. Could there have been more? Of course, but they can't all be novels.",0
"I downloaded this book #3 to have for reading on my flight, and decided to get started on it the night before. Sadly, this ""book"" was so short that I completed it inside 3 hours...hard to say with an ebook, but am guessing this amounts to about 130 pages, not including the teaser for book #4. That's the reason I'm giving this only 2 stars, as $2.99 is NOT a fair price for what amounts to 15-25% of a normal paperback.And for me, what I percieved to be the low cost of this series definately influenced how forgiving I was about the writing. But when I finish a book and feel ripped off, I tend to focus a bit more on the haphazard, illogical choices that poorly developed characters continue to make. I also tend to get annoyed with plot contrivances. So, even though I did rather enjoy this (very) light reading series so far, I honestly don't even feel a twinge at saying that I'm stopping in the middle and moving on. And that pretty much says it all, when you're a series addict like me.",0

The Archangels group consist of 6 men who helped England by spying on the French.The book starts off with Lord St. John having a ""wives sale"".

Little does he know Lady Gabriella has never seen a man naked or what to do with one even though she's been married for 25 years. Lord Drummond wins the sale and starts his mission off by pleasuring Lady Gabriella three times. Lady Gabriella is in shambles after that. She has never felt or experienced anything so unbelievable in her life. She figures since she was bought and paid for that she now needs to do what he said, especially after he brought her to climax and donned her in diamonds.If you want a fast historical very erotic read, then this book is for you. The story line wasn't that strong but that didn't bother me while reading this book. I wanted a hot steamy erotic romance and that is exactly what I got. I did enjoy it and I plan to read the rest.[...]",1

this book would make a great movie. i had high hopes because the book started out with a bang.  but then it got too convoluted with too many characters.  i am finally at 66% through and am finally getting into it.  before this book i was reading 2 a week and this one is just too long and so many characters its hard to keep track.,0
"The author keeps making vague references to things that happened YEARS ago in the story line but gives few details, keeps introducing new characters and yet at the same time makes it that virtually ALL the characters are all linked to one another.  Then the story ends saying ""go to my blog to continue reading"", however, this story is so drawn out now that not all the stuff was found by me on the blog, I was directed to buy more books that were more chapters in this ongoing saga.Since this was a freebie book, I'm out no money, but it was definitely a waste of time reading this.",0

B.j. Daniels just keeps giving us great story lines with sexy cowboys and smart sassy women.  Great story to read.,0
"This short read was great.  Fun characters, very steamy, well worth the ride.  I apparently liked it a lot more than several of the past reviewers.  Well worth it even though I have not read the earlier books and knew nothing of this author.  I will be reading the other books in this series.  This is full of quirky characters and yet they make sense, the plot is actually quite complex in spite of the short length.  It kept my attention and interest at midnight when I was having a little insomnia.There really is no guessing if a free book is going to work out but when it does I am jazzed.  There is some very steamy scenes, so if you're not into sex between consenting vampire and human don't download even if it is free. There is a tiny bit of bondage &/or dominance but it's all for fun, but just FYI.The heroine is an independent, sassy woman who has been hiding her light under a bushel.  She notices a hot guy and insists on being introduced and even though he plays hard to get she goes after him.  She does suspect he may be a vampire and you will have to read to find out why.  I know I will be checking out the hot guys sitting in the window seats on all my future flights!They hook up and go on a fast adventure with twists and turns aplenty considering the length of this read.  I recommend this as a go if you like steamy paranormal romances.",0
"4 1/2 starsShort and sweet interlude between Nalla's birth and Zsadist coming to terms with fatherhood in light of his traumatic past.FM doesn't advance the BDB storylines; but it is a very nicely done character driven exploration of the relationship between Bella and Zsadist. It's not necessary to the series, but it is a little treat for fans of Zsadist and Bella.",1
"****SPOILER ALERT***No Good Deed was highly reviewed on Amazon, so I decided to give it a try for $.99.  Unfortunately, I forced myself to finish it long after I'd lost interest in a promising storyline.  Here's what bugged me:1.  The character development was weak, especially our ""hero"".  I felt more connected to the love interest than to the good guy/victim.  And if that wasn't bad enough, I knew something was askew when I even found myself liking the ""bad guy"" more than Mark, who was wishy-washy at best.2.  Too many concepts not well executed - post 9/11 conspiracy, political torture, romance, Police/CIA procedural AND a magic camera?  That's a mighty tall order and the author didn't meet the bar, IMO3.  The imprisonment/torture went on and on consuming a huge chunk of the book.  Because I hadn't fully engaged with our hero in the beginning chapters, I wasn't entirely rooting for him as I should have been.  I was a bit apathetic and I finally got tired of the author's ideological harangue.4.  The ending both dragged and was abrupt.  Seems strange, I know, but you'll have to see for yourself.5. The formatting & typos were par for the course for most free and low-cost e-books so I tried to pay them no mind.I won't be seeking out more Mark Taylor and I can't recommend this book.",0
"The black cover looks nice and has a interesting texture.  The elastic strap keeps it closed, yet is easy to remove.",1
"I've read this book a couple times, mainly because I loved it so much. Everytime a new book in this series comes out, I start again from book 1. I loved this story because it takes place in an entire town of shifters. That's right, almost everyone is a shifter and you can't even find the town unless you are some how connected to it. Like Rachel, her aunt died and she's come to town for the reading of the will. Rachel doesn't realize it, but she's a special kind of shifter, like her aunt, she can choose which animal she turns into. Burke is the leader of his own pride and doesn't yet have a mate. Rachel's aunt was the keeper of the totem, which protects the town and helps keep outsiders out. Together, they must find the totem and find each other in the process. This book lays the foundation for the rest of the series and honestly I think it's one of my favorites. I would HIGHLY recommend it!!",1

"I expected a recipe book with serveral recipes on how to do porridge, and this failed to achieve what I wanted",0
This was a fast and kinda interesting read.  The characters are nicely developed  and there's a lot of tension that makes for wanting to see what happens next but a lot is left unanswered.  It does an OK job of describing 1969 and about Woodstock.  I wasn't sure what was going to happen as the author described writing a book titled 'Forty Years Later'.  Kinda odd but readable.,0
"She kills people for their blood, enjoys it, and makes choices based on visions she has without thinking it through. Very dark book.",0
"Alexia Colton had spent every summer since she was fourteen visiting her grandmother in the charming seaside town of Jaffrey's Cove, until adulthood and the need to work kept her away. She loves the ocean, and always felt a sense of peace and home there, and was always enchanted by the dolphins that often play in the surf just off the shore. When her grandmother, a once strong and vibrant woman, now feeble and needing help to move into an assisted living facility, calls Alexia sounding frantic, Alexia rushes to her gram's side to get her settled. Sharing this time with her grandmother, whom Alexia can tell is starting to decline in health and mental acuity, is invaluable to her, and when Victoria offers her granddaughter her seaside home and a stunning family heirloom, Alexia takes the necklace but declines on the house. Her work is in the middle of the country, after all.Soon Alexia is having erotic dreams of the boy, now a man, she'd once met as a child, making love to her in a cavern she's dreamed of her entire life. And her gram is acting stranger and stranger...and significantly less feeble than she'd been when Alexia first arrived. The ocean is calling to her and her body is burning with unfamiliar hungers. Alexia's world is shifting and she'll soon realize that she's not as human as she'd always thought, mermen are real, and the dolphins she's loved her whole life are all citizens of Jaffrey's Cove. And Alexia herself is the new matriarch of their pod, with two gorgeous and dedicated consorts, the cousins Joshua and Anthony, to love her body, heart, and mind for as long as she chooses. What's not to love about life changes like that??I don't need to spend much time on the erotica aspects of Tidal Wave. The sex is sizzling hot and extremely well done. Arend manages a nice blend of emotion driven sexuality and explicit sex that's extremely satisfying and too rare in erotica romance. I also have to give her credit for how deftly she managed to keep the sex scenes (of which there are several...it's erotica, after all) from completely overshadowing or eclipsing the plot and character development. That's rather a nifty accomplishment in a novella length story, which tends to suffer in those areas to begin with. Also, I'm very very picky about my reading choices when it comes to menage a trois erotica, when I read it at all. It's not a particular favorite of mine and I rarely find menage done in a way that appeals to my tastes. Tidal Wave mastered that for me. I was exceptionally pleased with all sexual aspects of the story.The other parts had a few bumps of a less erotic kind. This isn't the first story or series I've read by Vivian Arend. I've read several of the Granite Lake Wolves, as well, so this wasn't too much of a surprise because I've had this issue with her as an author before. Arend tends to master the sex and the emotion of a story in very short order, but the plot and characterizations sometimes have issues, as Tidal Wave does. Some of that is the nature of the beast in a novella. I like the way Arend writes and I'm greedy, so I want there to be more meat to the story, but to have more meat you have to either sacrifice some of the sex or write a book. While I have high hopes that Arend will eventually write a full length novel, with her novellas, she has a tendency to skimp a bit on fully developing the mythos of the world she's built in each story. In Tidal Wave that was a particular shame, because I would've loved learning more about the merpeople and spent more time with them in their dolphin form. I found the concept behind the plot to be fresh and unique and that's so rare it should be fully explored.There were a couple of plot holes and characterization blips that got ignored in this story. Why was Joshua sent away every summer Alexia returned to Jaffrey's Cove after the first time they met and shared a sweet kiss when she was fourteen? He wondered but there was never an answer given. Why was he treated so dismissively by his brothers? Why did Alexia dream of the cavern before ever going there and before receiving the medallion? No one ever had before. Those holes were frustrating.There was no explanation for Joshua's sudden calm acceptance of his cousin vying for Alexia's affections when earlier in the story he was quite adamant about being her only. The quick turn around in Anthony's case, from him telling Joshua he wasn't really interested in answering Alexia's call to being all gung ho about consorting with her was addressed, but in a cursory way at best that felt unsatisfying. Michael's plot thread was a very nice conflict and it added some depth to the story, but it wasn't as fleshed out as I would've liked, lacked a real solid motivation given the defined mythos of the pod, and the resolution was lackluster. Victoria was a nice secondary character, but she wasn't used as much as she could've been and she sort of left her granddaughter with very little understanding of her people. You'd think the former matriarch would care a little more than just passing off a necklace before disappearing.I know it sounds like I'm being picky, but it's frustrating to find that great blend of erotic sexuality and original mythos with an intriguing plot and totally likable characters...then have a bunch of little issues through the story. None of that made me dislike Tidal Wave by any means. I hope I don't give that impression. I enjoyed the story...it's just I wish there had been a bit more. I know; I'm greedy. 3.5 Stars.",1
Fortunately I don't have too I have them all on my Kindle.  I watched the Hallmark series and was hooked!  It is so great to have faces and voices to relate to the characters in the books.,1
I fell in love with Jane Porter and couldn't wait to be educated myself. Enter into a world where being a submissive is an honor most women crave and being tutored at the hands of Doms is a priceless gift.I was spellbound from the beginning.,1
"The beginning was very good. I liked the fact that Gram didn't know if Kasey was gay and he had all the worries of a teenager who doesn't know if he has a chance with his love interest or not. Their first kiss on the couch of a nightclub, stealing a moment in a dark, was beautiful and hot and sweet at the same time. It was a promise that wasn't really fulfilled.After that there's a lot of sex and the plot (young sport star who has to decide whether to stay in the closet and keep his endorsements or to come out and face the consequences with his teammates and fans) is lost in the bedroom. We don't really know the two characters and especially Gram is rather flat.There are no real problems in the book and it is a fast and hot read, but it seems incomplete and rushed at the end, like a collection of little episodes, but nothing really tying them together.",0
"Argus Ward's struggle to separate reality from his schizophrenic audio hallucinations makes for a really quick moving story. His confusion at experiencing symptoms of mental illness so suddenly after such a long time make this character one you will pull for and care about.  I was drawn into his world from the very beginning. As he deals with the end of the life he has become used to, he must also run from the cops and try to solve a complicated murder plot.  I literally could not put this book down!",1
Bianca D'Arc is great at writing paranormal romances.  She has just enough of spiciness without making it trashy.  I have read most of her books and will continue to buy them.  She has a great track record for good reads.  I've yet to be disappointed.,1
"This book is an anomaly to me. The action scenes are good and believable, the bits in between have some merit but the whole thing put together lacks something...I really enjoy historical novels especially those ones that draw the reader in and immerse this person in the storyline by proving believability AND entertainment.  I suspect this is where this book fails.The initial training scenes read too much like a lot of modern military novels and, while I have little doubt that hazing existed in the 'day' I want to see something with which I can relate the historical value to, not, just a change in uniform.By far the most annoying part of this book (and the the bit that got me angry and probably spoilt the read) was the spacing between the lines.  If I pay a high (ish) price for a book one of the first things I look at is the number of pagers.  This book had 400 odd pages but with triple and sometimes quadruple spacing I paid good money for a lot of blank spaces. Stopping to be cranky at this spoils the immersion in the story and the experience.So - read the book and enjoyed the story but do not feel compelled to read any more in the series..",0
"Description:Vengeance by A.J. Scudiere is appropriately titled; it's about getting vengeance, and lots of it. Claymore Beller was an accountant for the Russian mafia, until the day he tried to turn them over to the IRS, resulting in the murder of his entire family, and of Claymore; or so they thought. Claymore's youngest daughter Cynthia survives and makes it her mission to get vengeance on the men who killed her family.Lee Maxwell's family was also killed by the Russian mafia for his own betrayal. He, like Cynthia, yearns to get vengeance for the deaths of his wife and daughter; and upon meeting, they decide to make the mafia pay for their crimes. Law enforcement and the media refer to them as the ""Grudge Ninja"".Owen Dunham has been following the ""Grudge Ninja"" case, but none of the evidence/profiles seem to get him any closer to apprehending the suspects. Until he figures out their motive, leaving him to decide whether the ""Grudge Ninja"" has the right to deal out payback, or if  it's his sworn duty to report them.Review:After reading A.J. Scudiere's Resonance, I was excited to read Vengeance, especially after reading the book blurb. The characters were very unique and well developed, and the plot was definitely solid, two of the many reasons that the book took off as soon as I started reading. I love a good thriller, but most times I find them predictable, so the fact that I was constantly on my toes trying to figure out what was going to happen earned this book huge Brownie points. I also appreciated the level of detail, particularly the grittiness, violence, and gore associated with the pairs' vendetta. I wouldn't be surprised to see this as a movie or as the plot in one of the many crime shows currently on television. This fast-paced thriller is definitely on my recommended list!Rating: On the Run (4.5/5)*** I received this book from Griffyn Ink (JKS Communications) in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",1
"I really enjoyed reading this book. I had lived in the southern California desert for many years and could easily relate to the acurate descriptions. I found Henry, the main character, to be very laid back and easy going. I really liked him a lot.  He fits in perfectly with the Palm Springs atmospere. :-)",1
"I'm always interested in threesomes with real sexual relationships between all three people. And this supplied that, so it gets stars for that. But it's characterizations were weak and everyone was too perfect. Firstly I was annoyed that the two men were called Jace and Jasper, which were so similar as to be confusing. And sunny Sarah was just so sweet and friendly but also full of exceptionally hot fantasies that she had no hestiation in carrying out. Sadly it just wasn't that well written. This is the second Cameron Dane book I've bought and it will be the last, they have interesting premises but her writing just doesn't deliver. (The crime aspect was also really weak.)",0
"GoodConcepts are interesting with a sorcerer society, changlings and created beings.The interplay of the Covenant versus the societyThe way that the sorcerer society maintained control through limiting knowledge.BadNot enough time spent on developing the concepts.Even after all the training you still don't have a good idea of what the Shadu really are, partly because all that information is imparted to the main character off screen. It leaves them feeling empty.Unfortunately this is kind of the problem with the whole book many of these great concepts just never get fully developed they leave the reader feeling underwhelmed about the whole setting.Characters are just brutalized everyone gets raped, tortured and abused now I don't mind it a little but when that seems to be the formula that applies to everyone it just loses the impact of the events and instead of adding to the story if just makes you move away from it. I am sure in the next book Yar-Soga will get raped and tortured if the author follows true to form.Characters that have great potential like Yenaga the teacher for the Shadu had great potential but then is just killed as soon as she becomes more than a wooden cutout.Killing off all the characters. Every few pages a character is killed off no one makes it out alive this gets repetitive after a while and stops you from ever really getting attached because you know they all die.Ending ThoughtsI really liked the book to start I thought it had great potential but the lack of detail on the world makes it hard to get immersed in it. Then you have the constant use of world changing events when you have a character raped it should be dramatic a major part of the plot not just something to do to make the world seem ""dark"". I think that the author could use a good editor who would just tell him to slow down and fully develop a something before he skips off on the next great idea. And to not use rape and torture as everyday occurances.",0
"Lovers and roommates Christian and Joel want a cleaner for their home and if she's sexy, well then all the better. After they interview several horrid candidates they open the door to a young woman who'd fallen off her bicycle before showing up for her interview. Just one look at her and both men fall for the innocent girl and are determined to make her theirs.  Soon, Susie's cooked and cleaned her way into their hearts and what starts as merely some sensual fun turns into a desire for something much more.Susie's Choice was an interesting read. One thing's for sure, it was definitely a scorching hot read. But I just couldn't bring myself to like any of the characters. Susie's father treated her deplorably and she really didn't say anything in her defense. Even her brothers took her for granted, all demanding she cook and clean for them, having no life of her own.Christian's constant telling Joel he loved him, with no response in return was disheartening and almost seemed desperate. Joel's cowardice in not telling Christian he loved him went beyond his fear of being hurt. It smacked almost of manipulation, which lowered his stature in my eyes.While the sex between the two men as well as the three of them was undeniably hot, it seemed there were more pages of sex than there were of plot.  It got to the point that I really felt I knew nothing about the characters and wasn't sure if I wanted to. If you're interested in a story filled with almost nothing but sex and a token Happily Ever After, Susie's Choice might be something you'd be interested in reading. If, however, you want a story with any sort of character development and emotional depth, you might want to give this one a pass.Courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews.",0
"I admit I am biased, as I already loved the content of NYT.I love reading about finance, entertainment, style, and of course current events. The Kindle edition is easy to navigate, filled with pictures and is a pleasure to read.The Kindle edition does exactly what it supposed to do - making it a great reading experience.  On occasion, I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture, or something).  The online editions can be hard to read, and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have, but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork, the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers), easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition, in a great reading format.Well done!",1

"When I first started reading this book I thought what a different concept and I quite liked it, but as they kept adding characters it got harder to stay with the story. By the time I was half way through I just gave up and didn't even finish the book. I like stronger women in my books and that was a disappointment as well. I would say try it, you might like the way this is written just not for me.",0
"Okay so this book literally goes one paragraph in the present, then a flashback, present for a bit, flashback. It was so annoying. I felt so disconnected to the characters. I ended up rushing through because it was so annoying. I would not recommend this book. The hero constantly says he just feels lust for his WIFE. He talks about how he cannot let himself feels anything else. It is your WIFE, you are MARRIED, you can feel love for your wife you stupid anti-hero!!!! It was so aggravating. Then she walks out and he does not come after her but one word and a crook of the finger and there she goes running to him. It was just a pathetic excuse for a book and really, writing in general.",0
"If you are someone who likes a story to get somewhere, these books are not for you.  I read all 4 books in the series in the vain hope that some conclusion would be reached.  By the end of book 4 three plot areas had been introduced and not ONE of them had reached any form of conclusion.  The stories each hint that the next book will bring some form of conclusion but none is forthcoming. seems to be an exercise in spinning out a thin plot line into as many books as possible. - total waste of time",0
"1. Really liked the cover - not just another manly chest... and it was the cover that got me to purchase my first Beth Kery book.2. Her plot was good, with strong conflict and suspense.  Her characters were well fleshed-out and the sex scenes very well written - hot! - but more than that, the relationship was well-developed and reasonably realistic.I gave this book a 3.5 because there was quite a bit of confusion in who said what-who felt what-paranormal happenings present or past, etc.  It took me a bit of work to sort it all out. But there was never any question of finishing the book and enjoying it immensely...I just had to go back and check things a time or two to make it through to the ending.",0

"I picked this book up because it was free,and I wanted it for reference material. I already know how to tie a large portion of the knots in this book. My biggest problem with this book is that a lot of the pictures didn't load or wouldn't load. Since you can read how to tie a knot it is not to terrible a problem if you know how to tie knots. But someone who doesn't or is a beginner will have problems. All in all it is a good book and is very informative.",0
Excellent formatting and has a working table of contents which is great (as compared to the other versions floating around on the Amazon site)!!  I can't believe I am getting this many books for under a buck!,1
"..it is a short story. So why are there chapters? It took me all of 20 minutes to read it, add five for trying to figure out what she meant in sentences containing the improper usage of words (like people who try to use big words to sound smart but you can tell they don't really know or understand the meaning of them). A lot of typographical errors for a short story. Ok I don't want to sound like a prude because I'm not, but that kind of thing really bothers me, it's distracting when I'm reading, don't judge me I can't help it.As for the story, it had potential but it was very nondescript. A thesaurus would help her tremendously. The characters were baseless, there was no real info on them other than a physical description more so of Isabella then Donovan, and very very little background.It's a free, quick read, but sorely lacking in any depth at all. I say it doesn't hurt to check it out for yourself as long as you don't have to pay for it and you're looking for a quickie. Two stars just because the plot was original. I just wish it had been longer, more descriptive, and edited properly. (I don't ask for much do I?)",0
"The title for this review reflects the considerable influence that the Tom Swift series has had on science and technology n America. Visionaries like Steve Wozniak and Issac Asimov have cited it as part of their inspiration, and it was certainly part of mine when I was growing up (I went into math and physics as fields).The series is regarded as ""edisonade"" in character, that is, using inventors like Thomas Edison as the basis for the fictional character. The books, at least in the initial series which began in 1910, featured inventions and technology that had been or was close to being realized. The later Tom Swift series became more fantastic in tone. Many of he books are now in the public domain, but the character is still continuing (owned by Simon and Schuster, I believe), and a feature film was announced in 2008.The Tom Swift books were written in four different series. The books ncluded in this collection (26 of them) were from the first series and appeared in 1910-1932 and 1939. The last two books shown appeared in 1962. Their author, Victor Appleton or Victor Appleton II, was actually the pseudonym for a variety of different authors.My rating reflects the reverence that I have for my own memories of reading these books as a boy. At the time, I enjoyed them immensely. However, that was many, many years ago.hen I perused this particular collection, it was clear that the Tom Swift series was not aging very gracefully, and the technology being described doesn't hold the interest as well as it once did. Still, the books serve as a good source for insight into the beginnings of American science fiction.Anyone purchasing this particular edition should also be prepared for some poor formatting. The text is run together without proper breaks, and headings are not centered. The overall effect was so distracting that I finally returned the content to Amazon for a refund. Please consider that many of the Tom Swift novels in this collection are available as free Kindle editions. Rather than spend your money on this edition, you might check out the free ones to make sure you really want to spend your money to get all these works at once.",1
Interesting story about the inflated values society follows.  Great whodunit!  It keeps you guessing about what is really going on.  No redeeming morality in sight.  A sad commentary on values.,1
"This decently entertaining short novel is the first installment of Guido Henkel's supernatural adventure series starring his Jason Dark, Ghost Hunter creation.  Though the writing in this self-published offering is sometimes a little repetitive and clunky, it never sinks to sloppy or slapdash levels.  Besides, the scene setting and descriptions of Victorian London more than compensate: both aspects are moody and effective, nicely drawing the reader into Henkel's world of demons and supernatural investigation.My other criticisms are basically quibbles. I would have liked to see more dialogue between Dark and his supporting cast members; it would have enabled us to get to know everyone a little better, as well as break up the large blocks of dense description (usually of streets and buildings) in the prose.  Also, an occasional plot twist or dramatic revelation would have punched things up a little, especially at the end, where all we get is a long fight scene (though not a bad one).  But, again, I liked the moody, creepy vibe Henkel delivers throughout, and more importantly, I cared about Jason Dark and the people around him.From reading Mr. Henkel's book description here on Amazon (as well as his recent blog postings), I learned that I apparently just missed a revised version of ""Demon's Night"", which includes a new cover, a lower price, and a polishing of the prose.  So the most recent version of this book might be better than I'm giving it credit for here.  It's certainly cheaper.Will I come back for more?  Sure.  While perhaps lacking the crispness and total polish of a novel one might pick up at your local book store, the sudden availability of interesting self-published offerings like Guido Henkel's Jason Dark books on the Kindle more than compensates for any slight shortcomings in the final product, at least in this case.And, as we all well know, it's not like ""officially"" published books are perfect, either.",0

"I got the Kindle freebie which was suppose to be ""scintillating samples.""  What a disapointment!  Okay there were several pages of written words but nothing to entice me into wanting more.  In fact, I kept wondering if what I was reading was leading me any where.  It didn't  I don't expect to pick up another of Rosemary Laurey's--at least not intentionally.Waiting at Eros",0
"This is a very darkly written book but falls short of being a good book. I did like that it wasn't some stupid sappy love story with a vampire being in love. They don't have feelings. They are evil. They kill brutally. There is potential for this to be a really good read, it just needs editing and polish both with the plot and the characters. The writing needs more than just a little polish as it's full of silly phrases, grammatical errors, inconsistencies and filler.",0
Just read all of this author's books. They are all wonderful and make you feel ashamed for paying so little for so much work and talent.,1
"This was my first Robert W. Walker book, and I must say that thank goodness I stumbled upon it!Ever since I was a teenager I was always intrigued with the witch trials in Salem and this book had everything that I could have asked for. The characters were so very well written due to the tremendous attention to details by the author  that I honestly couldn't help but feel the joy, heartbreak, pain, frustration and fear that they were going through.I truly enjoyed this book!Would I recommend this book, ABSOLUTELY  YES!!!!Will I read more Robert W. Walker books, ABSOLUTELY YES!!!!",1
I didn't understand this short story and I didn't like it. It was just too strange and too graphic for my taste.,0
"If you are a fan of Ilona Andrews Kate Daniels or The Edge series, you'll get a kick out of Silver Blade. It was a little shocking to read how bright & lush this world is. You'll know what I mean if you've read the other series by Andrews. Dark, gloomy and apocalyptic are the norm. Although there are flowers and yummy pastries, have no fear, you still get the authors trademark gritty writing style. I was stunned at how much emotion and world building was packed into this tiny book. There was also a bit more smex than a normal Ilona tale 0_0! I'm used to the torturous wait for Kate & Curran.....LOLI love a good assassin story and there are way too few of them in my opinion. Add in Ilona Andrews mad world building skills and you got yourself the beginnings of a promising series IMO.",1
"First off the book is rather well written.  At times (mostly the action scenes (all 2 of them)) it was a little hard to follow, but it was a rather simplistic read.  My issue with the book is the pretense of involving ""werewolves"" at all.  It is really just a book about two people and love.  That's fine and all, but don't try to add an element of fantasy that is simply not there in this book.  It might come later in the series, but I will not read on to find out.  I read the entire book to never actually have a werewolf involved in it but in name alone.I was sorely disappointed with the story-line as a romantic novel, with little to no action.  Had I ordered the book from amazon, and not simply on my kindle, I imagine the cover would have tipped me off, so shame on me. 1 star for being rather well written, 1 star for what I guess might be an engaging romantic novel, but I cannot verify that as its not my genre.  I don't trash novels often, hence the 3 stars, but the book simply was not what the profile made it seem (at least while reading the bio on my kindle).",0
"TOO MANY SPELLING ERRORS --  A SENTENCE WOULD START IN ONE PARAGRAPH AND THEN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH WOULD BE FINISHED.  I HAD TROUBLE READING IT BECAUSE I WOULD CONSTANTLY HAVE TO GO BACK AND FORTH AND ""PASTE"" THE SENTENCES TOGETHER TO FINISH IT.IT IS A WONDERFUL STORY BUT I WAS FED UP WITH THE ERRORS -- I'VE NOTICED THAT SEVERAL OF THESE TITLES IN THE BILLIONAIRE/SHEIKH SERIES HAVE THE SAME TYPE ERRORS SO I WON'T BE PURCHASING ANY MORE",0
Super short story and ended right as it was getting good! The writer could have gone much further with the story. Not much discription of the characters either. It's and OK book if you have 5mins to kill cause that is all it will take to read the whole book.,0
"Shifter romance.  My favourite so far in this series and that's saying something.  A romance between a Puma and a werewolf Alpha.  Let the games begin!  Loved this story, good characters and well written.  Fantastic.",1
"I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. WHEN I WAS SEEN WITH MY KINDLE THEY KNEW IT WAS PEACE AND QUIET TIME, I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH I WENT THROUGH ALL 7 BOOKS IN NO TIME AT ALL, BEGGING FOR MORE.  iT WAS ONE OF THESE STORIES THAT WAS TOLD DO WELL THAT YOU FELT LIKE YOU KNEW EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM PERSONALLY.  IT WAS A BOOK / SERIES THAT BROUGHT UP ALL DIFFERENT TYPE OF EMOTIONS.  IT MADE YOU PRAY THAT IF ANYTHING SHOULD TAKE PLACE LIKE THAT HERE, THAT YOU COULD FIND A GROUP OF PEOPLE LIKE THEM.  IT IS REALLY NOT TO FAR FETCHED TO BELIEVE IN THE ""PEACEKEEPER"" WHEN YOU THINK OF THE SECRETS OUR GOVERNMENT MAY BE USING TO PREPARE FOR CERTAIN SITUATIONS. AND YOU SIT THERE PRAYING THAT IT WOULD END UP IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WISHING TO DO GOOD. NOT JUST FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COUNTRY BUT FOR OTHERS AS WELL.",1

"Cougar Falls is in trouble - the Totem's Protector has died and the Totem has disappeared.  The town's hope lies in the Protector's niece... who knows nothing about the paranormal world her aunt lived in.This story gives you a quick insight into how Rachel becomes the new Protector and thus gains four Protectors herself.  There is some m/f/m/m action in this so if that puts you off then just don't bother reading it.  As for myself, I copied Dean and Grady and thoroughly enjoyed it as it &#34;was for one night only&#34;!As this is a Novella, don't expect a book that gives the amount of description that Tolkein would!  However, saying that, the amount of description given in this book is astounding - the town, the people, the rivalries, it's all there in your mind as you read through this little gem of a novella.If you want something that is short and spicy - and you don't mind a foursome - then definitely give this one a go.  A good introduction to a new series for me to look out for.",1
Story was too convoluted and made absolutely no sense. Couldn't finish it and banished it to the unread &#34;Hades&#34; part of my Kindle since it was a free read. Not interested to read any sequels from this author's series.,0
This book started out very well but ends very abruptly. Everything gets resolved in only a few pages and the end isn't all that satisfying.  I was actually pretty disappointed because the beginning really does draw you into the storyline.  There is also a lack of explanation about the world that they're living in.,0
Top notch writing from Castillo Price as usual. There is a creepy feeling throughout the book when Vic comes out of his many years of drug haze and starts to notice things. His paranoia is based in real events but it can also cause very real problems in his personal life.,1
"The last year has been pure hell for Elizabeth O'Connell.  First she discovers that her husband has been living a double life, with a wife and family in Idaho.  To make matters worse she discovers that she is actually his second wife and that their entire life in California has been built on a lie.  Just when she thought that she couldn't take anymore, she is totally devastated when her husband cuts all ties with her and rushes home to Dundee determined to try and get his first wife to forgive him.  Unable to believe that he could totally abandon her and their children she follows him to Dundee.  With the marriage of Elizabeth's brother Isaac to her husband's first wife Reenie (Big Girls Don't Cry Harlequin Super Romance #1296) the next year finds Elizabeth and Reenie forming a family with their children.  Now Reenie has tried a little matchmaking, arranging a date between Elizabeth and Carter Hudson.  At first Carter and Elizabeth don't like each other, but the more time they spend with each other the more they come to care.  However, Carter tragically lost the woman he loved and Elizabeth is determined that she will never be second best again.The Other Woman touches upon every woman's feelings of rejection.  Both Carter and Elizabeth must deal with their pasts before they find a future together.  Although The Other Woman can stand alone, I recommend that readers first pick up Reenie's story, Big Girl's Don't Cry (Harlequin Super Romance #1296), as it is not only a great read but also will adds the background to this story. Brenda Novak has written a romance with truly complex relationships that keep the reader turning the pages and keeps them engrossed in the story until the last page.MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"I loved this book.  The characters are quirky but lovable and the action is non-stop. Add in a satirical look at current culture, some funny references to sci-fi TV, and characters out of a Hiiassen novel, and you have a winning combination for entertaining reading.  I am so looking forward to the author's next book.Be aware that there are few errors throughout the book where the wrong words are used in places.  Finding these was a pain but the book is funny enough to make you forget these little miscues.",1
If you don't care for a lot of swearing or big sex scenes this is a book you will enjoy. It is a mystery and it is a good journey to the end. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.,1

"Tricked Truth by Beth KeryI don't usually clarify my star rating but I felt I needed to with this story.  I almost always enjoy her stories to a varying degree, from good to very good except this story.  Oh...and except Velvet Cataclysm which I didn't like at all. Her writing style in this book is a bit like poetry in the way she uses her words.  Okay maybe not poetry but I don't know the word to describe it so here is an example. ""The amount of incendiary material he'd built up for Grace must have been monumental."" See what I mean?  The whole story is written like this, different.Now on to my thoughts about this story.First off Grace is NOT Trick's mother-in-law.  She was married to Trick's father Evan, so she is his stepmother!  Grace is described as his mother-in-law several times in the story, talk about confusing and not a good start to this book.  This story did get a bit better as it unfolded and the characters took shape for me.Trick was an asshat to Grace from the word go.  Grace was a strong, assertive woman with everyone but...Trick.  For the most part, Grace was Tricks whippy post, figuratively speaking that is--and she let him.  That's the part I disliked most, her hypnotic like acceptance of his treatment.  I understood it sure and it was explained at the end but I don't have to like it though.Then there was the mad dash to the end of the story where explanations' and secrets were revealed.  His reaction to these secrets was not what I expected meaning not much of a reaction.  No outrage or anger. The ending was just too rushed for me. I needed more closure.",0
"This was a very nice size novel especially for the price, but my only issue was too many analogies! I felt like I was just as confused as the H/h in the story. The misunderstandings in their communications could have come from too many references to abstract thought and words from other songs. I did feel as though the plot and basis of this story was worth reading, but be ready to reread lines throughout the story.",0
"It is short, it's story is undeveloped and worth what it cost which is 0.  Attempts to give it some depth are confusing and not worth the time it takes to try to unravel.",0
"I thought this might be an interesting read but I couldn't get past page 3 for all the foul language. Next time the book description mentions that it contains ""foul Language"", I will be more selective in my choice of reading materials.",0
"Thinking, fast moving and nearly indestructible zombies made for pretty fierce opponents and can not wait to read the second installment!",1
I like the idea that I can cover my kindle and put a strap to keep it closed and feel it is well protected by the cover. I'd like it better if it was made from a lighter material and didn't cost so much. That's why I gave it  a 4 star instead of a 5.,1
...but a new beginning. Amazing stories to remind us that we dont lose our loved ones forever and we should be open to the signs that they want to show us.,1
Hot sex scenes and good chemistry between the two.  Wish they had had more time to build a relationship or go on a date or two.  Near the end she finds out he used to be married--no surprise there since what she had learned about him was from viewing him interact with others at the office.  Overall worthy of four stars.,1
"If presented as part of a longer work, the lengthy build up to the action might work.  As it is, you get several pages of relatively boring bickering between a control-freak and his doormat wife/girlfriend and a (very) brief fight scene.  Without context, there isn't anything to draw you into what you are reading.I'd recommend skipping.",0
"This isn't the kind of book I normally read, although I try not to limit myself to certain genres. Sometimes I find epic fantasies a little tedious. Not so with this one! There wasn't one paragraph in this story that didn't hold my interest. Ty Johnston has a wonderful way with words so that his scenes come alive for the reader. I'm definitely buying books two and three of this trilogy!",1
"Worst book I've read in a liking time. Not only was the story mediocre, there were numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the book.",0
"I really enjoyed this book. I liked Nora and LOVED Tom. I couldn't put the book down, especially as the end neared. The chemistry that builds between Nora and Tom when they are stuck in the cabin together is great. This is a romance with lots of spanking and sex (and a very nice plot), so if that's your thing, you'll probably like this book!",1
WOW! Thats really all i can say about this book. I read it within 2 hours and put it down with only one thought....Wow!I def. recommend this book. If your fantasies needs a little spice..this is the read for you!Way to Go Maya Banks...you have a new fan,1
This was a wonderful short story.I absolutely loved the characters and the fact that they were in their 40's made it even better.I most certainly want to find this suite Ethan had on my next cruise!,1
"Joe has a job that requires him to travel a lot, but he also has his old family home that needs attention while he is away: the solution is to hire a house sitter. Tess is desperate for a change and an escape, so when she sees the ad for a house sitter she makes a call and throws all her belongings in her beat-up car and drives 6 hours even though he didn't really offer the job and she did kinda accept it. Now Joe has a house sitter with a small child filling his home and changing everything around him. When did life get so complicated?First off, this story was a great story. There was great character development, great analogies, and great romance. If everything was so ""great"" why am I only giving it 3 stars? Well, a few reasons really.Firstly, everything was so drawn out. Yes, it did help with the grounding of the characters and the changes in their emotions, but oh it just took forever for anything to ever happen.  It kinda sapped any enjoyment I had out of the story because EVERYTHING took too long. I felt like I was reading a 900 page book.Secondly, the book was written in a ""stream of conscience"" type of way where we are privy to the characters (and I mean ALL the characters) complete thought process. I'm not a big fan of this type of narrative. This is completely personal and subjective, but there you go. This narrative style also lead to the feeling of everything being drawn out.Thirdly, I had a few issues with Joe. He is a 44 year-old man who builds bridges for a living, which requires him to travel and work from different locations all the time. But, he has a woman stashed in each city. Now, these women aren't ""kept"" by him, nor do they expect commitment from him, but he shacks up with them whenever he is in their town. Now, it's not really this I had a problem with. The problem I had was that once he got into Tess' bed, he kept up with this behavior. He even talked to himself that he was a creature of habit, which is why he's now shagging another lady he has no real interest in; but Tess better not be talking to that Seb guy who came around last week asking for her. Nope, he can get his jollies off with some skank in France but she better be keeping house. Okay, so it wasn't really as bad as that, but it really rubbed me the wrong way. It smacked me of betrayal, of cheating, and of deceit--Especially because he made it seem, led Tess to believe, that all the other woman were no longer a concern...yet he goes a whoring as soon as he's gone.Usually, I'm not one for romance stories involving single parents of young children. I'm not sure why. However, Ms. Freya did such a great job in including little Miss Emmaline that she didn't detract or derail the story or romance.  Also, I loved how Tess had her friends and interests and helped define her.SECRETS was a nice contemporary chick-lit romance about how secrets can affect how you perceive life and keep true relationships from forming. A lot of bridge analogies were used, as Joe loves and builds bridges. This story is about the bridge Joe and Tess build to span their lives into a solid relationship together.",0

"This classic is a must read, especial for anyone who has read 20,000 Leagues .. Even if you simply watched Walt Disney's early film adaptation your sure to enjoy this story. There are a few place where it drags a bit and some of the language usage is dated, but that some how seems to add to it's charm.",1
"ok so the reason I gave this book 4.5 stars, was because it was too short... Otherwise  this story was FREAKING HOT!! but, BEWARE if you are not into menage, or guy on guy then this book might just not be the one you want to read. Its super steamy and sexy and blew me away with the sex scenes. I think this  author really did a great job on writing this story. It was extremely creative, and who would have thought a game like that would bring them together. This book was super cute, In the beginning Charlie didn't realize how she felt about the men who have been in her life for many years, they scared away the men she brought home, interrogated them whenever she brought dates to dinner, and it just never occurred to her that they might all have feelings for her. one of the guys she has a strong connection to his name is Simon and he seems like he has always been in love with her. Her and Simon have the strongest connection compared to the other two men. Then there is Rafael and Eric, and they both have liked each other (the men) and they just never hooked up because they didn't want to ruin what they had with Charlie. Until this cruise happened, they never tried anything with each other, and when it finally happens and they take chances and risks, Charlie gets scared and runs away. But will she realize that she has wanted them all along? Will they realize that she was the connection to all of them being able to love each other? READ this book and find out, i promise you wont regret it, it will make you HOTT!! make sure you have a fan handy!LOL",1
The dictionary seems fine...as dictionaries go. I really like the way I can make it my default dictionary on my Kindle.,1
Once again Charlie Parker out des the police while endangering herself.  Connie Shelton is amazing in how she keeps spinning these stories with every detail intact.  I love Charlie.,1
"She gets drunk, he forces her to marry him and to have sex, and when she wakes up hungover and telling him to let her go and how much she hates him he just pins her down and goes to town.That's rape.But, of course, since this is a romance novel apparently that is ok because the ' heroine' immediately stops yelling as soon as he's inside her and says ""that feels so darn good.""Yeah that line made me sick.",0
"I hate to be the first one star review, but maybe if I write this others will have more opinions to go by and get a broader perspective. I can't believe the paper back is 14.99 - Kindle was .99 and I still feel cheated! I really liked the premise, but the actual writing and story line was just ""lacking"", so much. I kept reading hoping it would get better and it just got worse. I really wanted to like it, but. wow, it was bad. Here are a few reasons:- Poor editing, at least on the digital version. I find that truly detracts from any story no matter how good (and more so when it's not so good).- There was suppossed to be this sexual tension and subsequent sense of falling in love between the two characters and it just wasn't there. He avoided her and they barely spoke. Her family treated him horridly (based on his great great grandfather's previous treatment of her), and she basically went along with it. They never really spoke, so where's the love? Even when she believes he's a different person (which happened way too easily), they still never had the actual falling in love - they just were, and then the were in love. Lame.- He lookd like his great great grandfather so much that only the height and build are a bit off and no one notices? Really? People tell me I look just like my mom, and yet, if you were to put us together at the same age, we would look related but not enough to pass for one another. Yet he is practically an exact replica almost how many generations later? Lame. Then it happens again later (won't say how, but really, what are the odds?). Lame.- The use of cliches and colloquialisms in writng, especially narration of a story line, is just poor writing. Characters speaking in them can be justified if it is done to make a point or to embellish a time period, but if it is done repeatedly or anachronistically it just detracts from the story line and weakens the writing. It's also freaking annoying! :)- The end is just......ok, lame. I sense a pattern. So, yeah, if you were to ask me to sum up my review in one word, I guess we know what it would be. I'd go on about the ending, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone who still wants to read it. I do think the ending is just wrong though, and it harkins back to my sentiments about them truly being ""in love"". Well, maybe she was, but him, not so much.If you love time travel romance, the best I've ever read is ""Outlander"" by Diana Gabaldon. An incredible book. An amazing series. It's not .99 cents, but It's worth every penny it costs for digital or hardcover. It's the quintessential time travel romance. Ah, I think I'll go read that series again....",0
"Regardless of grammar errors or misuse of commas I love this series.  I am on the 5th one right now and find it just as interesting as the first.  I am looking forward to the 6th and 7th one as well.  I love the action, would have given it 5 stars but as some have pointed out I was not thrilled how woman were portrayed until they were trained.  Another problem I had was with the dialogue when explaining how things were built.  I love strong female characters in books I read and there are a few in this series but it seems they all endured heinous crimes at one time or another.  Lina was great when first introduced but then she suffered from bad things happening to her.  Namid is strong now but she had to suffer as well.  I love the interaction between Jim, Pete, Tim, Pol, Bill, Lieutenant Wilcox and a few others.  I love how they are surviving to the best of their abilities when there is no government in place due to disasters happening world wide..I love how each book has a different element that they must face and defeat..I just find it so fascinating because truth be told you have to wonder would it really be like that if it were to truly happen...Overall its a fascinating series that I have thoroughly enjoyed reading..but that is just my opinion.  :)",1
"My Soul To Lose is a prequel novella to Rachel Vincent's popular series, Soul Screamers, which I have yet to read! While I think it probably isn't absolutely necessary to read this novella before the rest of the series, I found it to be a lovely introduction to the world and characters. It left me with a huge urge to read the first book which hopefully I'll get to do really soon! Sometimes novellas can be lacking in substance or feel like they were cut short but this one certainly wasn't.The story starts off with a bang. Kaylee Cavanaugh is trying to enjoy a day out with a friend but her 'panic attacks' are getting in the way of that. Kaylee's really having a tough time of it. She screams for no apparent reason and there's nothing she can do about it! Fearing she is mentally ill, she is admitted to a psychiatric unit and even had to be sedated for 15 hours. This story mostly takes place inside the unit. I've read a fair few books that feature psychiatric hospitals and I think of all of them, this one was the easiest to picture.Rachel Vincent's writing is just amazing! I could see everything clearly in my head and there was so much emotion throughout the story it was almost tangible. When Kaylee was having one of her attacks, it was described so well you could almost feel it yourself. You could sense her panic, fear and confusion. It really gets inside your head and makes you realize what Kaylee is going through. I just loved how real it all felt even if the circumstances and reasons behind it were a little surreal!This is definitely one to read in a single sitting. I was so captivated by the story, I couldn't tear my eyes away from Kindle. I loved the ideas, the mystery and the characters. Kaylee is a likable person and I'm looking forward to getting to know her better in the next book. If you want to test this series out, this novella is really a good way to do so! It will leave you hungry for more. I have a feeling I'm going to adore book one!",1
"I can't believe this was listed as a romance.  I read romance novels because I'm looking for something uplifting.  This book was dark & depressing.  I didn't find the story or the writing to be bad.  Just depressing.  Sex was very high overview and it didn't go into any depth on the developement of the characters relationship.Spoiler Alert ****If you like a happy ending, forget this.  It was said in other reviews, but I guess not strongly enough for me to truly understand. Hopefully I can say this plainly enough that others with the same expectations as me don't waste their time.  The hero dies a brutal death saving the heroine.  The book continues for several chapters showing how the remaining characters pick up their lives & go on.  It ends with the heroine sitting on a porch, contemplating her life & wondering what lies ahead for her, now that the man she loves is gone.I did almost cry at the end, but in anger that I had wasted my free time reading this book.",0
"There was an interesting twist on the menage relationship.  Though they were two men that did normally share their women they found that when their feelings were involved it wasn't so easy. I also loved the supporting characters. Especially Jacob. He was an older man, that when he lost the love of his life, decided to devote his life to saving young women who had difficult pasts and needed a bit of help to get their lives back together.  And Derek, his son, had a hard time growing up sharing his father's attention with all the women he saves. Nathan is his best friend, who he shares Beth with, though not so easily at first. And Beth had quite the troubled past with a step-father who abused her and believes she is having a sexual relationship with all three men. So after state cut-backs set him free of prison, he goes after Beth.So lots of love, action and a bit of suspense, that makes for a great story.",1
I'm torn I liked and I didn't. The beginning was misleading and could have been taken out. The ending was really interesting but didn't wrap up everything that was said within the book. I hope future books include darla's story because I think he sucks for what he did to her.,0

"I really wanted to give it a good review after seeing what some other ppl said here. Such extreme opinions. I have to say, this book was a very difficult read for me. The characters were ambiguous at best. Such confused characters are very hard to like. I finished the book after a week hoping for some sort of miraculous insight that would redeem the story. Never came. The story, even for a free one, is an insipid and uninspiring story. Really bored me to tears. Don't waste yr time. Plenty of other good freebies around. And note for the author, try having stronger characters that have definitive characteristics and feelings.  Yr story sounds to ad hoc, like notes crammed in to lengthen the story.",0
"Second in the Dragon Knights series, which is a different take on dragonriders; it resembles Anne McCaffrey's Pern books but is definitely for adult readers. The story starts with Lord Darian of Skithdron bedding a woman in a palace in order to gain access to secrets. He then decides that Lord Venerai and his ruler King Lucan are both deranged and evil.Two neighouring kingdoms, Draconia and Skithdron, are at odds and while the former boasts dragons as native beings, the latter has venomous serpentine beasts called skiths. These usually solitary creatures are being controlled for use in warfare by King Lucan. Adora, a healer woman, has just been seriously wounded by skiths and saved by a dragon, and now she is resting in the BORDER LAIR while her injuries heal. An older dragon knight called Jared, bonded to a female dragon called Kelzy, is caring for her and gradually falling for the courageous woman. Prince Nico of Draconia arrives and discerns that Adora is likely to be of lost royal blood, as she can 'hear' dragon speech and magically heal others.Belora, daughter of Adora, is also working as a healer, and mated to two dragon knights - women being scarce, the men willingly share a partner. Warfare is now waged openly between the kingdoms, the dragons flaming the skiths, which spit back acidic venom, while diamond-tipped crossbow bolts capable of piercing dragon scales are suddenly brought into use by the Skithdrons. Darius, fearing that the evil magic he has witnessed is taking over King Lucan, decides to defect in order to warn Draconia, thereby putting himself into grave peril. Meanwhile Adora is the subject of a well-meaning conspiracy by the dragon Kelzy, who decides that the woman requires two dragon knight mates.This is part of a complex series but can be read as a standalone, with sympathetic characters and well-imagined medieval warfare. Be warned, it features threesomes in a loving relationship between three life partners. Bianca D'Arc has written several books in this and her other fantasy series. I enjoyed this exciting tale and will be looking out for more of her work.",1
"I did like this story alot and there was some very erotic moments. I really like M/M/F and when the M/M are also together. I found that added a hot sexual element to the story and uped the heat.There were some editing flaws that I noticed, like the one male using the same condom without changing, but if you look past those oops errors, the book is great. I really loved the characters and was sad the book was over so quickly.",1
This is just a reprint of her prior book Exiles Valor not cool good books but who wants two copies of the same thing.,0
This book was AWFUL. The only reason I downloaded it was because it was FREE. Even though it was free it took time out of my life I will never see again.I read the other reviews and am wondering if we even read the same book? Or if a proofreader thought it would be funny to omit pages?Anyway it was a complete and utter waste of time. DO NOT READ.,0
"I liked the main characters, both nicely masculine.  I liked the sex scenes, though one was kind of a do-over which felt a little false.  Expanding the story beyond their little microcosm would've been good.  But the story was kind of like a house of cards, individual pieces work, but the whole thing rested on underpinnings that didn't make sense.  Also, the start of the book keeps going back and forth in time, telling you there are things you don't know, but slowly stringing them out for no reason.  It is an annoying construct, which the author thankfully moves past later in the book. There are some tragic aspects to the book, which the author tries to explain given they are wolves, but I think a good editor would've been really helpful in structuring the book and making it more logical.",0
"As usual, the characters are great, the woman is strong and kick ass, and the man is arrogant but like able because of what she sees in him...and how he loves her.  I loved this story.",1
"This book is almost useless.  It does not even attempt to give the most useful phrases, and is in some cases misleading.  I see that those familiar with languages have uniformly the same complaints as I.  For example, the Turkish section does not even use the Turkish characters, meaning that the pronunciations will be wrong.There are a number of online translators and travel sites that would be much more helpful.I think this is overpriced when offered for ""free"", since it is a waste of time and effort.",0
Over all it read a great book just not long enough.. I also feel like ot should be a part to.,1
"After two years, Caitlyn Culver is back in town and she's out to get what she wants.  Despite her father's threats against him, what she wants is rancher Cord Daily.  Aware of the truth behind Cord's wicked reputation, Cait decides to beat Cord at his own game. The luscious cowboy soon finds himself tied up and left wanting in her father's barn.  Cait better watch out because paybacks can be hell...of the most delicious sort.Cord has loved Cait for years, but that doesn't mean he's going to let the vixen get away with her trick.  With his cousin, Dolan Crane, Court treats Cait to a passionate night beyond their wildest dreams.  When dawn breaks, reality sets in, and Cord finds he isn't the only one who wants Cait.  Will Dolan make his move on Cait? Will Cait's father make her choose between the life she's always known and the future she could have with Cord?Take Me is the first story I've read by Mackenzie McKade and it won't be my last!  Cait is a character I would love to be friends with and who wouldn't want to spend a night in the arms of Cord and Dolan?  What impressed me most about Take Me (besides the sexy cowboys) is the natural emotional complications which arose after the trio's passionate encounter.  I dreamily sighed over Cord's possessiveness and I admired how Ms. McKade handled Dolan's attraction to Cait.  In the hands of another author, Dolan's desire to start a relationship with Cait might have annoyed me or detracted from the tale.  However, this is not the case; Ms. McKade deftly handles the emotions of all involved and I was more than happy with the story's ending.  Take Me is an engaging read, filled with likeable characters and deliciously hot love scenes.  Sinful, yet satisfying, I greatly enjoyed Ms. McKade's book.ShaynaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1

She's made a name for herself and is now in one of the highly sought after positions on the elite warrant squad. The only area of her life where she hasn't moved on is her love life.

Paul is very much in love with Jo so even though she's furious with him, as a reader I couldn't help but want them to have their happily ever after.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
"Penelope is a decent writer with a good writing style. I only wish I didn't have so many gripes about this book (not including the ridiculous spelling and grammatical errors).My first and biggest issues is that I couldn't understand or relate to how unstable the main character is - so much so, half the time I wanted to reach into my Kindle and slap her. And not just her, but all the people in the book. They all seem to be extremely emotional and immature (with extremely contradicting personalities - maybe they have MPD?).I know this is fantasy, but even fantasy needs some amount of logic. Long lived creatures like the fairies wouldn't be so manic depressive. Age is supposed to bring wisdom and tolerance - the ability to ""pick your battles"" - and yet these people are running around like children... it's like Lord of the Flies, the fantasy/apocalyptic edition.I also wish that the author didn't try to pack all the action into a two day span. Many of the things that happen would be more ""believable"" if she spread it out and created some sort of build up. The relationships that are formed within two days aren't even close to being realistic - especially when their lifetimes span hundreds of years.Finally, there are some unexplainables and loose ends that should have been tended to before the book ended... for example - Rae's age/childhood/family situation.I would still recommend this book for mindless entertainment, but simply caution that if you're a tad critical like me you may find yourself mentally editing and rewriting parts while you read. It's not terrible, it's not great... it just IS. If someone offered me the next book in the series, I'd probably read that, too. Would I seek it out because I just HAD to know what happens next? Not a chance.",0

"I more or less enjoyed the book; the heroine was not so lovable, but overall it was competently written and entertaining.  Then, near the end, there was a plot error so glaring that it blew the book for me entirely.***SPOILERS BE HERE******ALSO, SPOILER IS A LITTLE ICKY, AND INVOLVES GIRL STUFF. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.***Drew, our heroine, is heading out to the car after the hero's mother's wedding.  She has to get her purse for her tampons, because her period has arrived ""with a vengeance"".  Okay, fine, is the author going to use this?  Maybe.  Drew is kidnapped, stripped, and tied to a bed.  When the hero finds her, he's afraid something horrible (well, more horrible) has happened, because she's bleeding.  But no, he's referring to her arms, which are bleeding because she freed herself from the ropes binding her. Okay, not using the bleeding thing.  Then, that night, they make mad, passionate love.  This is a very straight couple--he'd never even had a girl on top, she couldn't identify a vibrator.  They are not going to be doing anything with her bleeding.  Also, she uses tampons, so there's a logistical problem.  At this point, I paged back a bit just to make sure more time hadn't passed and I skimmed it.  Nope, same night.It's a case of something very minor--the author using a tampon excuse to get the heroine alone to be kidnapped--turning into a major case of oops.  An editor should have spotted it.  I sure wish I hadn't.",0

"Morgan Crenshaw has spent all the time she intends to blending into the office background. She's a woman on a mission and if that means trading in her tomboy look for `skank' clothes complete with thong underwear then so be it.  Over the past year she's watched her boss, Ridge, parade his various dates in front of her, and she's determined to finally be the woman he desires.Ridge Casey has had the hots for Morgan since the day he hired her to work at the architectural firm but since she never showed the slightest interest in him he wasn't about to put a strain on their working relationship. Seeing her sitting at her desk looking like sex personified is almost more than he can handle.  Fortunately Morgan puts him out of his misery and admits that the radical change in her appearance is all for him.Ridge and his business partner Carter are expecting an announcement regarding a bid they'd put in for the design of the Honor Center.  They've lost out on the last two bids they put in so everyone's hopeful that this time is the charm.  As soon as Ridge sees Morgan the bid and anything business oriented takes a backseat to staking his claim on her.  He considers her his woman and seeing her all gussied up brings out the caveman attitude in him - heaven help her if she's dressed like that for some other man.Once he learns that they've wasted a whole year pretending not to want each other, Ridge isn't willing to waste another moment. He certainly isn't going to allow any other man to see her dressed so provocatively.  Like the alpha male he is, he drags her away from the office and takes her to his place where they proceed to cement their relationship.  There's just a little problem that crops up - Malone and Casey have lost out on the bid and this time they know that someone in their business is selling inside information to the competition.  Is it possible the changes in Morgan and her seduction of Ridge are intended to cover up her involvement in sabotaging the company?Annmarie McKenna has quickly garnered many readers attention with her smoldering hot storylines and memorable characters.  Who hasn't been `in love' with the boss, a coworker, or even a teacher?  Morgan's shy boldness really struck a cord with me.  She's got an air of innocent hopefulness while still maintaining a confident air.  Ridge is wonderfully alpha while still being vulnerable.  I was charmed by his insecurity where Morgan's concerned.  I'd love to see a follow up story for Carter - possibly with a hook up with the office `witch' Amy Lee.  I admit it I really didn't like her but I could easily imagine Carter taking command of her - in a very good way.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1

I was going to download the current issue of the Wall Street Journal and I was surprised how expensive it was:  $1.99.  I then found the Financial Times for $0.75.

The characters, good or bad, are truly human.  No super-heroes or super-villains.  Not giving the murderer a name made him seem even more ominous.As usual for Ms. Jackson, this book is well-formatted and meticulously edited.",1

I love Brenda Jackson's love stories, ( if you can call them that, because to me they are equally about family bonds)but, she does get a little repetitive with wording her love making scenes. I would still give her 5 stars on the story writing because I do love her take on romance, however, the editing of this five book set was awful. Need to use a better editor.",1

"Neglected as a child and subjected to countless disappointments, Jessica Evans doesn't want to believe in either love or relationships.  Determined to keep true feeling at bay, Jessie uses m&eacute;nages with her best friend Clancy and other men as a safety net.  She can enjoy the dominance she craves in the bedroom, but on her own terms.  But Jessie's safety net is torn away from her when Wade Peterson asks her to marry her.  Though she turns Wade down, Jessie still can't get him out of her mind.  And if the struggle to tamp down on her feelings for Wade wasn't hard enough, Jessie's past soon resurfaces with additional complications that unsettle her hard won control.Wade is crushed when the woman he loves rejects his marriage proposal.  However, the sexy-as-sin cowboy isn't about to give up so easily.  He might be willing to share Jessie with Clancy to keep her, for now, but the desire to have Jessie only for himself soon becomes too much.  Will Wade be able to win Jessie's trust and show her that true love and happily ever afters can exist?Mackenzie McKade does it again!  Bound by the Past is an emotional, engaging, sensual read I could not put down.  Wade is meltingly sexy, patient, dominant, and loving - the epitome of the perfect hero.  In the hands of a lesser author I might have become frustrated with Jessie and her determination to stay distanced from Wade.  However, Ms. McKade made me understand Jessie's fears and sympathize with her.  I adored her and loved watching her grow into someone who was able to accept love and give it in return.  As for Clancy, Jessie's best friend and the third in the couple's threesomes, he has me crying out for his story.  He's kind but tormented, supportive of his friends but in need of someone to love him and help him overcome his own past.Bound by the Past is the second in the Ties That Bind series, but can be read as a stand alone.  There is a brief mention of the hero and heroine of the first book, Bound for the Holidays, but having not read that book (yet), I don't feel I missed anything for this particular tale.  I dearly hope Ms. McKade continues this series with books for Clancy and Wade's siblings.At turns tender and titillating, Bound by the Past is a book I Joyfully Recommend.  Ms. McKade delivers a fantastic, blazingly hot tale with characters that will capture your heart and a romance that is truly sigh worthy.Shaynareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1

"I got this book for three reasons, first because it was free, second because it sounded interesting, and third because of the BDSM assert. that said this book is very, very dark. The sex is violent and there is little consent by the woman. We keep hearing about the clan and her lost ancestry, but none of that gives a reason as to why he needs to be so very brutal and unforgiving towards her. Not to mention that we Don't learn anything about the clan, it's need to function or how it fits into the story. There is absolutely no kindness, compassion, or gentleness AT ALL from him. Shame on the author for not goingving even a safe word she could use to get a break from this sadistic Monster who supposedly is her mate. Not once in the entire book does he profess his love or caring for her. Instead he repeatedly abuses her and has no care for her pain and suffering other than HE needs her to accept it so HE can be a man. This is no more BDSM than 50 Shades of Gray is!!!",0
"K.A. Mitchell is my favorite M/M author, her ability to create realistic characters is amazing.  I love that in this story both men would be what I would call Alpha types, even though it's primarily Jeff in charge, Ryan also steps up.  Very realistic storyline, Jeff can't let out that he's gay for fear of losing the time he has with his daughter, Ryan was in the Air Force so he's been in that same scenario where he has to hide that part of him. The sex scenes this author writes are incredibly descriptive & erotic; makes me feel a little like a voyeur!I do agree with the other reviewers that the book does end abruptly and hope the story is continued.What I didn't like: 2/3 of the book is the story, the last 1/3 of the kindle book is advertisements for other books to read/buy.  So very short story, but still a great quick read that I feel was worth the price.",1

"Private Property #1 by Leah Braemel* I received this book free from the author*Jodi is not happy about spending her birthday on a stake out/break in for a future client.  Her boyfriend Mark is the owner of the security agency they work for and he insists that she is the only one that can pull this job off.  Little does she know that she will find more than she bargained for once she gets into the house?Mark has been planning Jodi's birthday surprise for the past month.  He has enlisted the help of Sam to give her the experience of a lifetime and to fulfill her fantasy list.  When the time comes to put the plan in action, he is shocked by his own reaction to Sam pleasuring Jodi.Jodi never expected to have her wildest fantasies played out before her eyes with two smoking hot guys.  She wants to experience everything they are offering but at the same time she doesn't want to alienate Mark.  She is excited about the opportunity before her but apprehensive at the same time.She is in love with Mark but because of her bad history with guys she thinks Mark is getting ready to break up with her.  He blew her off on her birthday and scheduled her to work, why else would he do this unless he was tired of her.Sam is glad to join in on their fun but one look at Mark with Jodi and he knows he's a third wheel.  He cares about his friend and is determined to make his friend admit what is in his heart, even if he hates him when he is done.  Jodi is beautiful and responsive to his every touch and he just wants Mark to realize the treasure he has.Mark isn't into long term relationships until Jodi.  She is smart and beautiful and he doesn't want to share her, even if it's to fulfill her fantasies.  He's angry at Sam because he has to sit and watch their play without participating.  He is also extremely turned on watching Sam dominate her but he has an overwhelming urge to mark her as his.This story was hot, sexy and a lot of fun.  Mark was super sweet to arrange for Jodi's fantasies to be played out, even if he wasn't crazy about another man touching her.  The dominate scene with Sam was powerful but I think the scene afterward with just the two of them was even more powerful.The characters were kept to a minimum which worked for this story.  There was also enough back story for the reader to understand what was going on, without over powering them with too much information.  It was also fun learning a little about the security business.Overall I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to pick up the 2nd and 3rd book in this series.  I want to learn more about Sam.

The story was kind of disjointed and not very fluid.  I really wanted to like the main character Rae...but this just felt like this another ""vamp vs were"" love story with a weak, unknowing woman.  But instead it was a vampire vs. a fairy.  It was a half hearted love story at best.  Breandan (whom she is mated to) and Tomas (whom she equally cares for) both get the short end of the stick.  Neither really wins the girl.  I didn't feel like Rae was really into either guy, it seemed kind of forced and lacking.  Actually, the whole story seemed forced. Rae learning that she is a fairy, finding out about the two tribes of fairies, the rules of fairy life and fairy politics...blah, blah, blah. Good rebel fairies versus evil Devlin and his followers.  To top it off, the whole all demons vs humans angle didn't really grab me.  I mean, I think the general idea of the story was good, but there was a lot of room for improvement.",0

"Fairy Tales from the German Forests includes ten tales of German origins. I'm fairy certain that these stories are only written to seem like fairy tales, instead of being properly traditional tales ala The Brother's Grimm.Because they are stories rather than folklore, the morals are heavy-handed, the prose is overfull of descriptions, the ethnocentrism is more distinct, and the setting is a bit more modern.Most of this can be explained because the intended audience is children, but with the unexpected use of a swastika (it's totally just crossed axes, though, according to the text), and the period-appropriate but not currently-appropriate gender roles for little girls, I can't recommend you read it to children. And with the annoying descriptions I can't recommend you read it as an adult. Although I did vaguely enjoy skimming one or two of the tales.But basically you should go find something more productive to read with your time. Or just...stare at a wall for a bit and imagine what an awesome fairy tale would be, because it'll almost definitely be better than these.There's a clickable table of contents and a few illustrations (remarkable!)Contains the following stories:What's the Use of It?The Engineer and the DwarfsKathchen and the KoboldThe Old KingThe Dragon's TailThe Easter HareThe Nixy LakeKing ReinholdThe Witch's GranddaughterHoliday Adventures",0
"While this book is a quick read and decently written, I feel like there was one page of story for every 5 pages of sexual scenes. Maybe I am just not into that type of novel, not to mention Vampires are overdone. Definitely will not be buying the sequels, mainly because I don't see how this has anything to look forward to plot wise. However, if you are looking for raunchy sex scences page after page this may be the book for you.",0

"I can handle far-fetched, and I love most vampire stories that I read, but this story along with its prequel, fell terribly short. While it was a short story, it felt painfully slow to get through and at times made very little sense. The characters are copies of other popular vampires and fairy stories like Twilight and the Sookie Stackhouse series, and then the author overdoes it with the religious aspects. In one paragraph the concept of ""being Christian"" was mentioned about 4 times, and I just don't see how it added anything to the story. In fact it took away for me, because I got tired of the characters dilemma with religion when the premise of fairies and vampires are somewhat the opposite of religious, it just got to a point of annoyance for me. The explanation was never given for why the religion was so integral to the story, and the writing was so terrible that I skim read the prequel because I couldn't stand the grammatical errors and ridiculous religious connotations. I know this is a series so hopefully the author will improve, or include some clarification, I just won't be reading any further in this series to find out.Reviewed by Gabi for Book Sake.",0
"I really loved this book - the middle-aged heroine, a house wife, more or less, who sets out on a mission - in this case to find her missing husband. At first she is treated as a bit of a country hick, like a jilted wife and more or less like someone who is more trouble than she's worth, but Miranda is nothing if not determined! The relationship between her and her husband was sweet. I suppose the story was fairly simplistic, and occasionally almost frustrating as Miranda tried to solve the mystery of her missing husband, and certain elements were pretty obvious from the beginning (which made it all the more amusing when the protagonist completely failed to notice them)but I just found it utterly engaging.",1

I only gave this story 1 star because you have to rate it or it won't let you leave a review.  I understood the 1st part of the book just fine however I found myself not even caring about the main character Lawson.  The 2nd part I was just lost.  I mean in the beginning the author was specific in the enemy or opposite the main character (Lawson) & starting with the next chapter he starts talking more about Japan & martial arts.  I did not understand half of what was written & the fact that the author seemed to go on & on about Japan & fighting & never mentioning the enemy had me not caring about the story at all. I am not even sure that it was the same story.  I deleted it from my Kindle at 52%.,0
"The elements of this story showed off the the author's individual flare.  Rather than a run-of-the-mill nonhuman romance, she creates a cool world where shifters practice magic and potion-making and the rules of shifter society create real conflict for the hero, Lucas.  The heroine, Nita, has a lot of depth; she deals with avoiding life by sticking to her routine, something a lot people are guilty of.  Lucas makes some errors in judgment that have real consequences and those errors make him a plausible character.The love scenes aren't terribly memorable and the villain is dull, trite, and unworthy of the main characters.  Also, it would have been great to see some the pack's prejudice rather than just take the characters' word for it.  Despite these setbacks ""City Wolf 2"" was definitely worth the read.",0

"So Lila and Hunter come together under - odd circumstances. Lila tries to stall the coming together and Im actually glad that Hunter said no because after all a deal is a deal and if she didnt think through what she was getting herself into then she shouldnt have agreed. Lila was so angry at Hunter but at the end of the day she agreed so control your anger and stop your bantering. Then all of a sudden she finally decides to accept the fact that she wants him and Im confused as to why the sudden change? Even Hunter questioned it! I also didnt understand why Hunter was such a jerk about letting her go, it's not like she wasnt going to see her dad after the agreement was over - why not end it amiably if he thought she didnt feel the same way about him? I actually didnt mind the angry sex and whatnot - and to be fair there is a warning about this so if you as a reader are put off by this then do not read this book. Overall though I thought the book was just ok - no romance - no depth really (talking about why you are the way you are in a few pages isnt enough - especially so easily). However, this contemporary take on beauty and the beast wasnt bad at all but it did have the potential to be better.",0

The idea was so interesting and I found the character development intriguing and then... it unraveled, and it tangled, and it tripped and then it was done. Like an old school zombie, it kept dragging it's self along- long after its legs were cut out from underneath him.",0
"Here we have a great premise for a series, with the retired schoolteacher and the small-town cop banding together to solve mysteries, and I appreciated the picture-postcard Maine setting as well. However, I think the book shows its roots as a first novel----it isn't badly written, but could use a little more polish. (And really, an editor should have told the author to remove just about every exclamation point from this manuscript---as a rule, I would say that novels simply shouldn't contain too many exclamation points---practically NONE, in fact, unless they're used in dialogue.)Now, this is a solid mystery, and not a romance---no love scenes here. And that's fine---however, I think a definite shortcoming of the book was the lack of ALL emotional content. It's as if the author is uncomfortable with writing about relationships. I've read other gay-themed mysteries that focus on a decent whodunnit while also delving into the private life of the main characters, and they've been quite satisfying. The complete lack of detail regarding the relationship between Jesse and Tim in this book is rather off-putting, actually, and difficult to understand.It's a great set-up for some decent drama---here you have two old school acquaintances getting to know one another again after thirty-five years. But the way the book handles their initial hook-up is baffling: Tim comes over to dinner at Jesse's place one evening, without Jesse even knowing Tim is gay---and then there's a jump-cut to the next morning with Tim coming out of Jesse's shower, and apparently they're now a couple. What the heck??! This would have been a great opportunity for a long dialogue scene which could have been played in any number of different ways. No, I'm not asking for a sex scene---but I would like to know how these two ended up together, what they said to one another---there is NOTHING in the text to indicate how this played out.Likewise, a little later in the plot Tim's eighteen-year-old daughter comes home from visiting her mother and finds Jesse at Tim's place. Suddenly she not only finds out her father is gay, but that he's actively involved with another man----great opportunity for drama, no? Well---apparently not---because once again this is never explored---we never do get to know what happens, how she reacts.So for me this is a problem---I'm not asking for the novel to turn into a torrid romance, and I have no problem at all about there being zero explicit content. But I would like to know a little more about the relationship of the protagonists, how it develops and plays out; I'd like a little more emotional content in the book, in addition to the mystery. So, as such I wasn't really satisfied with this in the end, and I'm giving it a mixed review.This is the first of several mysteries in a series, and I am curious to know what happens next---and if the author's writing style shows any development. But, I'm not sure whether I want to continue if the other books also ignore the relationship as thoroughly as this one did.",0
A very funny book.  What can go wrong does. You wouldn't believe what happens to this woman.  I loved it.,1
"This book is short and to the point. The series is all about an alpha male and the attraction between him and 'his' mate. Well, this story gives us that. No, it's not all drawn out with the back story of what's going on really in the rest of the series- although you know this great war/trouble exists.And I like this heroine. She's feisty and a bit more mature. She's got her head about her. Not all 'oh' woe is me. I would have enjoyed a full scale story about these two. Actually, I wonder if we see more of them further in the series- that's how nice they are together.And, you get some humor in this-- they are neighbors, you know! Enjoy.",1
"A nice and short book to read. End. That's the most I can say about it. There is no depth in this book and it didn't make me think about the story after I finished. Such a shame since I love Fairy Tales.I did like the idea behind the book. Old fairy tales and change it with a dark twist? To finally get to know the ""real person"" behind the story! I love it! And they are the ones who must protect us against evil? Marvelous ^^ Although I've never heard of Rip van Winkle, is it an American fairy tale?Not a lot happened in the story, some demons were killed, some ""action"" and that's it. Also not a lot of time passes in the story, two days at the most. I know there books and movies made about less time than that, but in this book there wasn't much content. Even the ending was over before I could blink with my eyes, I didn't even got the feeling that this would be the end! Beside that, too much of the story was focused on Greta's history. Although it's interesting to get to know the real Greta of Hansel and Gretel, I was more interested in the here and now, not what happened in the past.I also would have liked to see Rip and Greta struggle a bit more before they would be reunited as a couple. They only have one conversation and their back together after years of separation... Usually, it's not that easy isn't it? And personally I like a bit of tension and glances at each other before they succumbOverall rating 3 stars. Nice book for a rainy Sunday afternoon, when you've got nothing else to do. I think I'll stick with the series to find out about the other fairy tales ^^",0
I'm having lots of fun reading Elizabeth's books.  She has a way of transporting me into another world.  I find myself getting lost in these stories and can't wait until I can finish my chores and return to my make believe world of romance.,1
I just couldn't do it. This book was just too boring for me. I couldn't get past the first couple chapters.,0
I'm not too much into paranormal romance novels but I must say that Caleb is a man's man. He knows what he wants and he goes about getting it. In this case he wants Sommer and boy does he get her. A good read.,1
"If you like a good action/thriller, certainly you won't be disappointed by this book. The story is direct, without jumpings in time or parallel characters. Everything is centered on the main character, Argus, a paranoid who get involved in a murder and doesn't know what is real or hallucination when he starts to lose control of his health. It made me think about how crazy must be a schizophrenic's mind.The plot definitely kept me hooked and reading whenever I could. The writing style is very good, no formatting problems or typos, although I think the author abused a little bit of the past perfect. The ending was very well done too and the final premise left me thinking of how this advanced technological era we're starting to face nowadays could be used to control our relatively predictable human (or should I say, animal) behavior...At a price of U$ 0.99 usually the waste of time bothers more than the waste of money, but with ""Crack-Up"" you won't waste either of them.  That's a really enjoyable book.",1
"Shelby has been lusting over John Garrett for more than a year now,  but the Navy SEAL doesn't even seem to know she is a woman.  Yeah, he talks with her, but he never seems to catch on when she is flirting. Heck, she even asked him to dinner once.  Then one night she overhears that the reason he has never pursued her is that ""she's vanilla.""  Whoever thinks she is vanilla has never been in her daydreams.  So she sets out to show John just how wrong he is.John has had spicy daydreams about the cute little baker for a long time now, but she is so wholesome, he won't ever act on them.  Then one wild and crazy night, during a heat-wave, she propositions him and his best friend.  How could he say no?  But will the night be a one-time-only? Or will he and Shelby finally see their true feelings for each other?Oh, baby! Two sexy Navy SEALS and one woman, what more could you ask from an erotic story? Well, if you are me, you want a great plot and a spunky woman to bring them all together.  Heat of the Moment has both and definitely does the trick. I thoroughly enjoyed how Shelby finally decides to make a move, and figures out (by overhearing a conversation) the way to make sure that she gets what she wants.  And boy, does she get it.  Ms. Kennedy has written a super spicy edition to the Red Hot Summer series.  She also has a new fan in me and I will have to go look for her other works.  In the meantime, you need to pick up Heat of the Moment when you get a moment.Tanyareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1

"I loved this book and had a hard job putting it down. Quinton is world weary. He works for a company that assesses the environmental impact of logging operations, but life and tragedy long ago caused him to set aside his idealistic, green principles. Regina is married to the boss of the logging operation, a man who pretty much owns the town of Crow's Landing and doesn't care who he tramples in his pursuit of success and financial gain. Throw in Regina's troubled teen, Michael, and Quinton's part Native American heritage and the conflicts start to pile up, especially when Regina and Quinton meet and the spark between them cannot be denied. These two troubled souls can't ignore their attraction for each other, despite the risks. Their budding relationship renews their enthusiasm for life and gives them both hope that happiness is possible again. But the tensions in Crow's Landing reach snapping point and when the logging mill burns down, somebody has to pay. The plot is complex and fast paced, and kept me up late turning the pages to find out what happened. There are some great secondary characters, especially  Hurricane and Fury, the two dogs. This is a wonderful love story with a satisfying ending that left me hopeful for their future.",1
Another great Greg McKenzie book-this one involving an ancient manuscript and danger -and the possibility of World War III. A real thriller-another book that I could not put down.,1
"My Soul To Lose is a prequel novella designed as an introduction to Rachel Vincent&#8217;s Young Adult series, Soul Screamers. It is about Kaylee Cavanaugh, a high school student who sees shadow visions so frightening that they send her into debilitating panic attacks. When one of these attacks strike her in the local Sears store, Kaylee is restrained by security guards and rushed to the hospital. She awakens to find herself in the psychiatric ward. I don&#8217;t want to say too much here, because it is a short book and I don&#8217;t want to give too much away.This novella does a nice job introducing readers to Kaylee and her strange condition. By leaving the ending somewhat open, she left me wanting to read more (which is kind of the whole point to a prequel). This is the first book I&#8217;ve read by Rachel Vincent, and I&#8217;m impressed. Her characters are real teenagers, not perfect little &#8220;Bella Swans.&#8221; Her characters were interesting, but relatable. Her descriptions of Kaylee&#8217;s panic attacks were terrifying and make the pulse race. This series might be a good one for those Twi-hards who are looking for something new to read.Overall, I give My Soul To Lose&#8230;Character Development &#8211; 3 bookmarksCompelling Plot &#8211; 3 bookmarks (Lots of open-ended questions, but I&#8217;m sure those will be addressed in future installments.)Age Appropriateness &#8211; 4 bookmarks (Light profanity, but if your kid can&#8217;t handle the word &#8220;shit&#8221; they have larger problems.

"Psychologist Rolanda Mitchell had been kidnapped by a sheik!  She was supposed to be in Afghanistan to counsel soldiers; but, instead she was standing before a very handsome stranger who introduced himself as Shahryar with the request for her to tell him a story each night for the next one thousand and one nights.  What came as an even more of a shocker to Rolanda was that he knew her erotic romance writing pen name.Biding her time while planning her escape, Rolanda composed her first night's fiction entitled Positively Despotic...In the land of Frumos - where two brothers were bounded by magic, by birth and the love of one woman - as long as the triad was whole, the land would be peaceful and prosperous; however if it was to be broken only destruction and hostility would exist.  For a century, that bond had been broken by treachery and black magic - now the time had come for the current ruling brothers to find and unite with their special woman to restore tranquility and harmony throughout land of Frumos.The Alexandrescu's brothers Valentin and Dragos were perceived by the outside world to brutally take whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted.  Well, international reporter Kiana Davis was determined to discover if all the negative rumors surrounding the Alexandrescu brothers were true.  Kiana gained more than she bargained for when she discovered nothing was quite as it seemed.  What came as even more of a surprise was her strong attraction to both Valentin and Dragos and the brothers' insistence that she was the one to complete their triad.Author Shara Azod has managed to roll two fantastic stories into one with Positively Despotic.  The first couple, Rolanda and Shahryar, will remain a secondary focal point for the entire series of 1,001 Nights with Shara.  I was greatly intrigued by this couple.  Ms. Azod successful carved Shahryar into a great, sexy mystery that I am eager to discover more about.  Rolanda will definitely have to stay on her toes with him because I have a feeling that very soon she will be the star in Shahryar's bedroom scene long before her 1,001 nights' freedom come knocking at the door.However, the main plot revolved around a threesome couple.  Instant sparks flew and the flames burning hotly until the very end.  Even though the storyline took place over a couple of days, Ms. Azod still managed to craft a plausible, spell-bounding tale with incredible characters.  Valentin and Dragos were dominate, sexy and very charming alphas, while Kiana proved to be a strong, intelligent heroine.  Their sexcapades, whether as a twosome or threesome, were passionately erotic and frequent in nature.  All in all, Positively Despotic was fabulous read that I am sure many will enjoy.NikitaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"I didn't find this a good read.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it has a good premise but doesn't deliver. Much of the action is implausible and so it had no credibility for me.",0

"I'm totally in love with Lila Dubois and her Monsters in Hollywood series.  I grabbed this as a free read and am so glad I did! The second I finished this book I downloaded book 2, My Fair Monster!Clever premise, excellent writing, lovable characters and blistering hot sex!  I had to crank up the A/C!The main romantic characters, Michael the monster and Lena the hollywood power player, come through an amazing journey in a short time but it just works.  It's not rushed as some books would have main characters go from strangers to engaged in sixty seconds.  You feel his worry over her acceptance of his monster form, her struggle to love all parts of him, and the obstacles in their way.  The timing of their acceptance of each other and their emotions is perfect.  The dialogue was great, the stories behind their names - hilarious!  The monsters sneaking into homes to watch movies of humans is wonderful.Don't miss this book or this series!",1
"I started off with high hopes for this story because I really love paranormal romance especially with werewolves, but this book was basically one hard-core sex scene after another with a plot added on. I don't have any objection to the sex scenes themselves (though I did find the language unnecessarily coarse), but I wanted them to be needed in order to move the story along and not just be there. I also did not believe that the queen could have so much hatred and fear for werewolves and still fall madly in love so quickly just because of Mace's sexual prowness and dominance. I also couldn't see how Nayla had no problems sexually after being raped by her parents' murderer who was a werewolf. Overall, I thought that the story line was good but I didn't really enjoy reading the book and I would hesitate to recommend it to others.",0
"Second book in ""Dakota Heat Anthology"". Preceded byHer Dakota Men. Followed byDakota's Cowboys. Note thatDakota Heat, Volume 1appears to contain the first two of 4, in paperback.Plot:To save her brother from jail Samantha appeals to the owners of Dakota Ranch. Shayne and Jackson see something more in Sam, someone they want to protect, love and maybe even have a future with. With a little loving, respect and patience it might even be possible.Comments:- Contemporary Cowboy erotica with menage (threeway) sex.- 2273 kindle locations, 31739 words- Sex is m/f and m/f/m - very generous and loving, caring, gentle and all about her. No m/m. Aiming for a committed threesome.- While ""Dakota Ranch Crude"" is part of an anthology, it isn't a *series*. These books are in no way connected and can be happily read independently.Opinion:Although the suspense is a little wussy, the romance is very sweet and the sex terribly HOT. Shayne and Jackson are sexy Alpha-types, but not so overwhelming that they smother Sam. Sam has strength, character, and intelligence - when they order her around she listens, takes it on board and understands why they are making these demands. No one is demeaned or treated as a child. They all take an intelligent, thoughtful approach to their relationship and respect each other. It's Nice. And when they come together, it's Hot. An excellent book. Recommended.Aside:Although we have strongly Alpha men who like their woman to follow the rules they've put down for her ""safety"" and ""own good"", they are no where near as Dominant as the men of Brooke'sDesire, Oklahomaseries. If you are looking for that style of book, this anthology is not for you. There are no bdsm aspects, no Domestic Discipline on principle, and the menage relationships are private rather than a societal expectation. Rather we have a good set of menage novellas with strong romance, steamy erotica and mild suspense plots. But they aren't in Desire.-CR-",1
"Romance stories are commonly based on characters that secretly plot and withhold information.  I enjoy the suspense of the characters uncovering each other's untold stories.  However, in this story Susanna repeatedly out and out lies to Adam.  Not about her background, but about her intentions toward him.  She needs Adams help to keep her newly acquired plantation running, so she agrees, to his face, to marry him, while secretly planning to break the betrothal after she picks someone worthy, who can then take over management of the plantation.  He begrudgingly agrees to keep it secret, so she can enjoy a little romantic, secret, suspense.  He even asks her at one point about the feelings of her other suitors, when they find out she was just toying with them, & she asks whose interests he cares about, ""hers"" or ""theirs"".  The fact that all ends well, doesn't negate the fact that she's a conniving, manipulative, deceitful, user.  I REALLY didn't like her & couldn't get into the book.The idea behind the story .. the death & switch had a lot of potential, but dislike of the characters overpowered that.There were comments about too much sex.  I didn't get that at all.  By the middle of the book, I was looking for a good sex scene to break the monotony.  There was nothing but a few kisses in the first half.  The 2nd half did have several scenes, but I didn't find them overly detailed.  What I didn't enjoy was that they started out with one of the characters angry with the other and ended, at best, with distrust.  The sex scenes were all about slating needs, not emotional connection.I finished it, but it drug on endlessly & I was glad when it was over.On the positive side, the writing style was above average.  I might try reading something else from this author.",0

"In the Dark Lands, a virus killed all possibilities of female offsprings. In their search for wives and families of their own, the Beasts have created a pathway between their world and Earth and proceeded to kidnap suitable brides.The plot could have been fine and the typos can be overlooked. The gradual adaptation of the women to a new world and the heroine falling in love could have made for a great story if it had been treated with subtlety.What irked me is the blatant sexism and homophobia that permeated the story. The brides have to be pure (meaning virgins), they are mostly very young (sixteen) and deemed old enough to marry men twice their age. They're kidnapped and kept prisoners until they agree to marry. Those who try to flee back to Earth are punished (worse, the author even makes them like their punishment). There are many references to the fact that the men must be dominant and the women trained to obey and follow. Once kissed, they seem to loose what little reason they were born with and are enthralled with their kidnappers. The only things they require to stay are a) clothes and nice apartments and b)marriage and the wedding night.Homosexual practices are deemed against nature and disgusting.Now, I understand that this might be the view of some readers and I respect that the author has the right to her own beliefs. Unfortunately, it goes against my own beliefs of equality between the sexes and acceptance of all mankind, even those with different taste in their bedroom partners. I finished the book,  would not recommend it to anyone and will avoid this author in the future.",0

"This book along with Phantom Desires is really well done.  This story line also keeps your interest, moves along smoothly and gives a good play on your emotions.  It is easy to read because it flows so well and while there's a lot going on, the writer does a good job providing the answers to the questions you will have as you read.  D'Arc does a good job describing and defining her characters and keeps it all consistent when some other writers are all over the place with their stories and you never know what's really going on.  Ms. D'Arc does a good job keeping it &#34;straight&#34;.",1

"In the rather corpulent and bloated market of supernatural romances, this book stands out with its more creative setting and characters. Like a dark Alice in Wonderland, poor Two falls down the rabbit hole of vice and is mysteriously rescued by Theroen. Theroen, as anybody can guess, is a vampire and he introduces her into a dark world of violence and suspense. Readers are kept on the edge, by not knowing how characters would react and whether there would be indeed a happy ending for the characters. The ending is rather open ended, which I suppose gives a good platform for a sequel, but is not as satisfying.",1

"Opening line: ""The long, wet spring had finally turned the corner into a Connecticut summer so glorious that the residents of Old Wethersfield decided among ourselves it had probably been worth the wait.""The protagonist, Kate Lawrence, and her daughter, Emma, are out for a walk, watching the swans in a local pond, chatting about their immediate plans. Kate snaps photos of the swans - two parent swans with their four little cygnets - to document their progress.Kate is co-owner of MACK Realty and Emma, a paralegal, is launching a real estate law practice with a friend. The morning walk mixes business with pleasure. Mother and daughter admire properties as they hike ""the loop"" where ""nearly every Cape Cod, Colonial, Victorian and farmhouse along our route shone with fresh paint and liberally applied elbow grease.""So what can go wrong on such a glorious summer morning? The answer waits in Kate's office. Someone has sent her the stinking bud of a corpse flower and a clipping about the plant's anticipated flowering at the end of June. The anonymous gift is wrapped in a sheet of paper with scribbling in the margin: ""It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you. And it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink.""The poison pen letter is almost ignored in the confusion that results when a plumber finds a skeleton hidden in an historic house belonging to ""the Henstock girls."" The ""girls"" are the spinster sisters Ada and Lavinia, now in their eighties.By the time the cops arrive, the skeleton has disappeared. It promptly turns up in photos Kate took of the swans swimming serenely in the pond, and the anonymous letter writer strikes again. There's another clipping about the stinky corpse flower and this time the scribbling reads: ""The lovesick, the betrayed, and the jealous all smell alike.""So much for a ho-hum life in the quaint little town of Wethersfield.The poison pen letters seem directed to Kate, who is on the verge of cohabitation with Armando, an attractive South American transplant who is the controller of a telecommunications company. However, the letters could as easily be directed to her two partners: Margo, a southern belle who is in a relationship with a cop named John, and ""Strutter,"" a Jamaican immigrant, whose husband is also named John.Kate is a magnet for trouble. She's tailed by someone driving a black van. The man knocks on her door late at night. Does she call the cops? No, she calls one of her partners and the cops come swarming in. Meanwhile, the plumber who discovered the skeleton in the Henstock house is nowhere to be found - fake ID, non-working cell phone number.And what about those pesky letters? When Kate is mugged in a parking lot, the investigation kicks into high gear.Kate is an amateur sleuth in the tradition of Miss Marple and Jessica Fletcher, attuned to the people in her small town, pooh-poohing any perceived danger to herself, quick to give others the benefit of a doubt.Some minor nitpicks: In one place, Kate's relationship with Armando lasted 8 years; in another it's 7 years; and in yet another she has known him for 5 years. Also, Margo's speech is full of dropped ""g's"" when a couple of instances would have sufficed.This was a comfort read that I hated to see end. Like Kate, I was caught up in the goings-on in Wethersfield, curious about the skeleton and the fate of the two old sisters and wondering how Kate would adjust to Armando's moving in with her.",1

"I felt this book was an ok read. A very different kind of plot, food not breeders. I kind of felt the other women should have fought harder or something...no wonder they treat them so abominable.

I ENJOYED THIS STORY A GREAT DEAL.  IT WAS WELL WRITTEN.  THE CHARACTERS ARE REAL. I would recommend this book.,1
"From the cover I thought I would really like this book. The only thing I liked about it was the cover. There is no mystery or suspense in the book at all. It is very predictable. You know who the killer is almost from the very beginning. Even though the author attempts to throw off who the real killer is, it is a poor and lame attempt. The main character Tyler seems to gain super human strength and intelligence at times. If it wasn't for his ""intuition"" and sudden knowledge of things he had no previous knowledge of a few chapters previously, then there would be no way for him to ""solve"" the murders. The portrayal of the police is laughable at times. They're idiotic morons when the author needs them to be and super sleuths when he needs the story to move forward. All of the characters need more development and are poorly written. I'm not sure what all the 5 star reviews were for. I'm glad I got this as a free download I would not have been pleased if I had paid for this.I normally try to find something I like in a book, but in this one I can't say there is anything.",0

"This book didn't really go the way I thought it would.  For one, I expected more action overall with the fact that Griffin is being hunted and I also didn't expect him to find out about Jarrah so quickly.  The dystopian society was a nice touch but I would have liked some more detail about it to make the backbone of the story a little stronger.  Overall I liked the story but, honestly, I think it would've been better if there had been more conflict; really the entire thing was just too EASY and that's a shame because I could see the potential for a more in depth story.",1
"This second book of the Peacekeeper series builds on the first book. It is actually sort of 3 acts, so it provides some good variety.Act I - an old nemesis;Act II - Circus Animals (and who doesn't like a circus?) andAct III - a set-peace battle against the Marauders, only this time much bigger and badder than before!We even get an upgrade to the Peacekeeper itself, learn a hidden new feature and have a primary new scientist join the adventure.If you liked the first book, this is a good read, as it continues the saga without just repeating the story from Book 1.",1
"If you are looking for a serious story, steer clear. This one is pretty ridiculous and silly. Yet, I found myself laughing at some of the situations these folks got into and the witty dialogue. I liked it for the simple read that it is. The writing is good I think it was the author's intent for this to be campy.Rebecca's transitions were plain ridiculous. After spending a lifetime under her father's thumb, she wants to be bold and colorful. Yet she could never think of repurposing her Madam aunt's whorish dresses into something a little more demure to find a happy medium between her and her man. The 'chickens' figured that out for her. I enjoyed that she snapped back at Lucy of the Bible Brigade.Sexy Sheriff Adam is fairly one dimensional (would have like to get some history about him) and their romance was really non-existant. They were hot for each though. Particularly after she offers her virginity to him. Well, it's either that or auction it to the highest bidder now that she's the owner of the whorehouse. To keep law and order he's always threatening to shoot someone. And actually does it a few times.The villain was just tossed in, I'm convinced, to be the Snidely Whiplash of the story. That's exactly what I thought of when he enters town.",1
"Jace Rankin may be short, but he's nothing to mess with, as the man who was just hauled out of the saloon by the undertaker knows now. He's a famous bounty hunter in Oregon in the 1890s who, when he shot the man in the saloon, just finished a years long quest to avenge his sister's murder and is now trying to figure out what to do next. When the snotty-nosed farm boy he just rescued from a gang of bullies offers him money to kill a man who forced him off his ranch, he reluctantly agrees to bring the man to justice, but not to kill him outright. But, first he needs to tell his sister's widower the news.Kyla ""Kyle"" Springer Bailey has been riding the trails and sleeping on the ground for the past month while trying to find Jace. She wants revenge on the man who killed her husband and took her ranch, amongst other crimes, and she's not so keen on the detour Jace wants to take. But she realizes she's out of options, so she hides behind her boy persona as best she can and tries to keep pace. When a confrontation along the way gets her shot and Jace discovers that Kyle's a Kyla, she has to come clean about the *whole* reason she needs this scoundrel dead and hope he'll still help her.The book has its share of touching moments and slow-blooming romance. Kyla, we find out, has good reason to fear men and hide behind a boy's persona. Watching Jace slowly pull her out of that shell and help her conquer her fears was endearing. Her pain was real and deeply-rooted and didn't just disappear in the face of his sexiness. Neither did his understandable aversion to marriage magically disappear after a round of nookie. Why would a man who's drifted from town to town for his entire adult life - a man who's killed his fair share of men along the way - feel he'd make a good husband or father? They're both the walking wounded and in a unique position to help each other, they just need time to realize it.However, while it was packed to bursting with my favorite themes - Old West setting, a heroine passing as male, a morally ambiguous hero, wounded souls, road romance, the kitchen sink - there was a certain...distance in the writing that kept me from getting carried away. Both characters were distinct and fully-formed and I couldn't point to any glaring instances of bland telling or anything, I just never felt really invested. I enjoyed it quite a bit, as it was an exciting trip, but I was watching them from far away. I definitely wasn't on the run alongside them. Add on a hasty and too tidy ending, and the book left me feeling a bit less than completely satisfied.I enjoyed the book, but I can't say it was above average. I'd still read another book by the author.Note: I read the re-released ebook version and noticed there were a lot of formatting errors and missing words. I had to mentally edit as I read for some sentences to make sense. It wasn't too too bad, but it was a little distracting.",0
"I was excited to be able to read the continuing story of this series and was not disappointed in the least!  A story that brings together various bands of supernaturals, fighting against evil all while building love and friendships.  Well written, balanced and closed.  I am more than anxious for the next in this series and hope to see a child of special abilities come from the union of Dante in this book!",1
Jane Austen is one of those authors who will always be modern and enjoyable. This is a collection that should be on everybody's bookshelf (or Kindle).,1
"It will not be a book I put on my re-read list.  The story was a bit confusing. To many questions left unanswered. To be a really good book it needs more background.  I know there are 2 more books in the series, but not having a base to build on I really won't miss reading them especially since they are about $4.00 per book.  I got this one free thankfully.",0
"Coombe's Wood was good and spooky for about 3/4 ths of the book.It seemed focused on the supernatural but then when it got vulgar,graphic and perverted,I quit and deleted it from my Kindle library.",0
This story was interesting and unique. The love between a cat and a snake . . . LOL.,1
"Bringing very little to the staple Vampire stories.The beginning looks promising, untill Two enters the vampire scene, but then it goes downhill and really is a bummer to finnish, because the action is slow and the vampire's flashbacks are very tedious.I am not particularly keen on vampire boks, but, seeing that this one was for free, I thought that a guy who offers his book really would have somethinhg different to show to the world.No. My mistake.I won't, however, give it a one star review, because I respect an author who has no qualms about offering his work.",0
"I received this as a freebie on another site a year ago. I quit reading after the first or second chapter. I found it hard to follow as it was part of a series, and there wasn't enough detail in the first chapter to give you a lot of groundwork - it seemed to assume you've read the previous books. By the time I quit reading, things were really just... not very believable. Not plausible at all, for a woman with an abusive former husband.",0
"I will be right up front and state that I couldn't finish this book.The viewpoint kept switching from one character to another from paragraph to paragraph. A few times it even switched to omniscient.  This was not only annoying, but extremely distracting.Also, one character seems to have some kind of secret that the author didn't want us to know, I assume until the end.  However, some of the story was even told from her viewpoint. Now, if you are basically in someone's mind, wouldn't you know their secret?One other point was that the emotions of the characters just seemed extreme. The main character would go from smiling & joking to an almost murderous rage from one sentence to the next. And, yet, no one seemed to notice his extreme emotional instability. They even referred to his 'boyish charm' or something like that.He seemed to me to be extremely emotionally unstable. Which is fine, but he wasn't hiding it & yet, no one seemed to notice.***Spoiler**** (not much of one since I didn't finish it, but wanted to warn)At one point, the main character's girlfriend tells the guy's best friend a story that leads the friend to think the main character had RAPED her. At the end of that conversation, he asks the woman to 'look out' for his buddy while he moves out of town. Yeah, if I think a woman's been raped, I would definitely tell her to be sure to be good friends with and take care of her rapist. &lt;sarcasm>I'm sorry. The premise seemed good, but the writing was not.I am giving 2 stars instead of one in hopes that perhaps the author will take this criticism and do some rewriting. I think he has talent; it's just very 'raw' talent.",0
"Hawke is an interesting, unusual hero. The author writes extremely well! He holds your interest to the very end. This is a fun read.",1
Cultivating story. Alluring write. I enjoy stories that are written erotically and not vulgarly. This is one of those stories. A little short but a  very warm read. I was left with the feeling of needing to readthe next chapter.,1
I love cowboy romances and Patrice is an excellent romance writer. I've read a number of her books and will keep reading. I rather read then watch a movie.,1
"Since the murder of her twin brother and his wife, Sara is hunting vampires. Little does she know that the man she had a week long hot affair a year ago is a vampire himself.It's Ok but nothing special. It is too short for the reader to identify with the main characters and the change in Sara's viewpoint on vampires is dizzyingly swift. It's a nice paranormal romance, good for a few minutes of light reading.",0
"Alma Owens narrates a very interesting picture of life in the days without running water, indoor plumbing and having baby after baby and loving each and every one of them (the children, not the hardships).  Its written in a way that if you close your eyes and listen to her words you feel as though she is speaking just to you, regarding her life when times were very very hard. Not driving she had a very limited means of getting around places until she was older and then she learned to drive.  Her husband was not encouraging in her getting out and about on her own, and in some way, not real supportive, but that was the way men were in those days.  I loved this book and highly recommend it to anyone wanting an very interesting peek into America's history.",1
Loved the characters and the story line was very good. The story felt rushed though. It would have been much better as a longer novel.,1
"A little weirder than the normal vampire books, it wasnt all that bad.  Im kind of sick of all the typical ones, so at least this one had that going.",0
Who would think that dragons would  bond so closely with their knights that they merged mind and body.... you really will enjoy this wonderful episode.....,1
"Although WSJ has good reporting and covers all the news, the price keeps going up.  I often buy alternatives due to the inflated price.  I don't think the Kindle version of WSJ is that much better than other sources of financial news (Financial Times, for example) to justify the price difference.",0
"Erotic Research might have been predictable, as another reviewer wrote, but it was still very enjoyable.  Emotions and actions of both student and teacher were strongly described.  It is a fun read that can get your blood flowing.",1
"I cried real splishy splashy tears, the mark of a good book. This was such a moving and thought provoking story to be aimed at a younger audience but I think older readers would enjoy it too. William Woodall really gets into the mind of a 14 year old boy. What I like about this author is that he's not trying to be like anyone else. He's not copycating C.S. Lewis like so many others try to do. He's not afraid to approach the Christian aspect but he doesn't beat anyone over the head with it either.  His work is unique and I really enjoy it.I think he should have included discussion questions at the end of this book because there are so many ways to start a conversation with the many themes it contains.I would give the writing 4 stars only because the characters weren't as distinct as in other books I have read by this author. For instance, the names Brandon and Brian were so similar I kept confusing them. I thought the two main characters could have used something in their speech to set each one apart. I really enjoyed the unique way he has of putting things though. Here's an example.""Nor did he dream, except the sweet and simple dreams of the pure at heart, of the kind that nourish the soul but are never remembered.""I should also mention that the writing reminded me of a bedtime story in places. Some people might find that a bit distracting but I felt it added to the fairy-tale fantasy feel. I give the story line 5 whole stars. I'm sure someone has written about similar things but this felt original to me.The Christian aspect I'd give 5 stars also. It is very appropriate for the intended YA audience but also appealing to a much wider age range. I could see reading this book in a homeschool setting. I guess because there are so many nuggets of truth hidden in there. It's about Heaven. It's about bad things happening for a reason. It's about deciding for yourself what matters most in life. It's a really good book!I am working on his short story collection next.Note: I wasn't asked to review this book and I bought my own copy. I'm a blogger and I have access to tons of free books. I just love this guy's work!",1
"I am not really a fan of short stories.  It takes a lot for me to really enjoy one.  That said, My Soul to Lose was the exception to my usual reaction to short stories---I really enjoyed this one!My Soul to Lose is a prequel to Rachel Vincent's Soul Screamers series.  When you start My Soul to Take, Kaylee's stay in a psychiatric unit is alluded to but you get no details.  In My Soul to Lose, we get the rest of the story: what led to Kaylee's hospitalization and her stay in the psychiatric unit.I felt so sorry for Kaylee during this novella!  She has no idea why she sees shadows around people, feels like they are going to die, and then can't stop screaming.  Her aunt and uncle are no help and Kaylee has no one to turn to.  She meets Lydia in the psychiatric unit, but does not forge a friendship with her until the end of the book.  When Kaylee finally finds someone who might know what's going on with her, circumstances change and she is left in the dark again.I would recommend reading this before My Soul to Take.  Fans of the series will love this novella.Just One Gripe:It was just too short!  I wanted more, more time with Lydia, more time to get to know Kaylee, more story.The Best Thing About This Book:Finding out the circumstances behind Kaylee's hospitalization.",0
"It really wasn't what I was looking for. They were ok just not what I wanted. I wanted something that was a little easier to navigate and I wanted to be able to bookmark and highlight things I wanted to get to easily. These options may have been there, I did not open and look to carefully because there were things that was not there I wanted.",0
"London - 1867Dylan Blake has spent twelve long years in dedicated service to the Crown.  He's sold his commission with the hopes that his father would allow him to take over one of the many Blake estates.  His father refused and Dylan's attempts at finding comparable employment on his own are proving unfruitful.  He may be the son of an earl but his situation is getting dire.  His has very little funds, is on the verge of being evicted from the boarding house where he's staying and his father's hatred for him is blatantly obvious.Because of her large dowry, Lady Natalia Sinclair is a highly sought after young woman.  She has no illusions about her many would-be suitors - they're all far more interested in her monetary value then her.  Besides, she's perfectly aware that her father will select her future husband and therefore the endless parties and courtship techniques are pointless.  There's only one man who appeals to her, Captain Dylan Blake, but he's a second son and doesn't possess a title.Dylan takes great pride in infuriating his father and what better way to accomplish that then to arrive late for his father's all-important annual ball.  Receiving one of the prized invitations is considered a social accomplishment - there are only one hundred guests to his shindig and Dylan throws off the whole thing by arriving late.  While most of the guests are horrified at Dylan's audacity, Natalia is intrigued.  She's read newspaper articles lauding his military accomplishments and would love for a man like him to court her.Dylan escapes from the stuffiness of the ballroom along with his friend Lord Basingstake.  Once there, Dylan is confronted by Lord Jonathan who makes a wager regarding Dylan's ability to charm a woman of Jonathan's choosing.  The woman chosen is Natalia and all Dylan has to do is get her to agree to a second dance - something which no man has thus far been able to accomplish.  The wager is for one hundred pounds.While he's never had any trouble charming any woman, Dylan will soon discover that Natalia is unlike any other woman and she sees right through his good looks and bluster and sees the empty shell of a man he's become.  There's no emotion behind his request for a dance and because of that simple fact she turns him down.  Dylan's life is about to change in a major way - all because of a good woman who's too smart to accept any less than all of him.  Throw in a few well-hidden family secrets and Dylan may just find the one thing he's always wanted - someone to love him unconditionally.Diana Bold captivated me with THE AMERICAN HEIRESS and I really wanted to know more about Dylan and Natalia's story.  Dylan's need for love and acceptance really pulls at the heartstrings and makes you wonder why his father hates him so much.  Natalia is impossible not to like - she's smart, beautiful and not at all pretentious.  I loved the emotional turmoil both characters experience throughout this storyline and especially enjoyed how Dylan learns about the family secrets his father tried so hard to keep hidden from him.  This is a wonderful tale and I highly recommend both THE WAGER and THE AMERICAN HEIRESS - trust me, you'll want to read all about Dylan's brother Michael's trials and tribulations with a very improper American woman.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
I really wanted to like this book but I just can't get into it.  The two main characters are just not developed enough and couldn't grab me like they usually do.  I've tried to get involved in the story 4 - 5 times but it is just not happening for me.  I finally just gave up at around 18 percent read.  Sorry but it just didn't grab me.  I will look for more of the authors books and give another one a chance because I think she has great possibility with the right material.,0
"Great novel. It surprised me; it was different from the previous Hannibal Jones mysteries. There was less beating up bad guys and more vulnerability. As usual, the characters were all very interesting and very unique. Read this one!",1
I got this as a freebie and was interested since I'm a huge fan of Jon Edwards. Some of the stories were a little dull but the last one made the book worthwhile.,1
4.5 This was such a charming and very sexy book. I just adored all the characters and by the end I was dying for book two. Great series!,1
"This is a cute short story, and worth the read as a freebie.  I liked the world-building and the main storyline.  But the characters aren't internally consistent.  Selina is presented as an intelligent, independent 19 year old - who somehow takes half the story to reach a conclusion that was obvious to the reader much earlier on.The grammar isn't bad enough that it kept me from enjoying the story, and is better than most self-published stories.  But it still could benefit from some cleanup.I'd read another book by the same author, but I wouldn't necessarily be willing to pay for it.",0
"I was looking for a book to download to my Kindle when I ran across this extra story on my favorite characters from this author - Zsadist and Bella. All I can say is that I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by just how much plot and dialogue we got in this continuation of one of my favorite couples.The story covers the difficulties for Zsadist and Bella when they had their first child. I really like how it explores just the pocket of time when fatherhood was pretty new for Zsadist - and how the couple worked through it. It really just gives us 15 minutes more with our favorite JR Ward characters!So if their story was your favorite book in the series, then I recommend that you read this story. You will enjoy it.",1
"So it wasn't a total waste of my money or tine. A bit of a tedious read. I enjoyed her descriptions of the area around her father's property, but her feelings about her dad's recent death and her boyfriend seemed empty.",0
"Paper-thin characters make inexplicable decisions (what kind of hit man would decide to kill someone during a packed church service?) and everything is wrapped up in a big Jesusy bow.The item description didn't make it clear that this was Christian fiction (although maybe I should have realized that is what was meant by &#34;redemption&#34;).  I don't mind Christian fiction, but this is so laughably immature I can't imagine anyone enjoying it.",0
"This is the best book I have ever read in my life.  I am 60 years old and read about 100 books a year.  This is a story about a group of men who really care about each other and risk their lives to help each other.  There is plenty of action and adventure to keep your interest, but the true story is this group of men.  I keep it on my Kindle, and when I have nothing else to read, I open the book and re-read it.  I wish modern novels where of this quality.  I enjoy all of his books, but this is his best.  I recommend it to everyone, and it is free, how can it get any better.",1
I actually was surprised to find how much of the story took place in North Carolina. It was like hearingnews from a local friend. So intrigued by the descriptions. Enjoyed the book very much,1
"Good story showing the enduring quality of love despite loss, heartbreak and stubornness to let new love into your heart after loss.",1
"I enjoyed this book because it lets us look into another time in our past history.  Also I am an older reader and this takes me back to a time closer to the way we were.  Far from perfect but much more genteel with manners sometimes to a fault, plus the influence of the Christian Way again far from perfect but much better than now, as far as I am concerned. Since I am closer to 80 than 70 I have lived from before WWII until now and I wish we would return back, at least to the idea that &#34;using vulgar words was for vulgar people&#34; that most people had no respect for and avoided whenever possible.  popcorngranny",1
I liked the idea of Bruno and Renee having unique elemental powers.  It gave this book additional paranormal facetsSome words were too repetivtive.,0
"How many times is author going to get Amazon to delete this or add comments about alleged conspiracies of people out to get him? Is he f*in delusional? My review:I have to agree with a few previous reviewers. The author doesn't know the basic mechanics of writing, so how in the world is this or any other he's written full stars? There's not a page that isn't filled with grammar problems. The story itself suffers the same problems from the author's inattention to detail. Characters are inconsistent in their actions. It's like they're interchangeable pegs on a board the author puts into places when he needs them.",0
other than the fact that i thought this book was erotica it had an interesting and action packed  plot not even close to being a romance if u are looking for romance or erotica do not read this,0
It is way to short and not really anything to read would not recommend this to anyone. No dept.  Could of been a good book if there was one,0
I love this series.  Lora Leigh is a fantastic author that really makes you feel for these characters.  I just get caught up on the errors.,1
"An interesting idea, but I would not recommend this book to my friends.  There are some errors.  I'm not sure if they are from bad formatting or from author/editor error, so I won't fault the author on that.  However, I do fault the author for not being able to decide if he was writing for an adult audience or a YA audience.  I wish he had made up his mind.  I'm not sure how to explain it, but sometimes it felt childish and other times it seemed a bit 'too much'.  YA-lit is a tough thing to write.  It's always a fine line between being too watered down and being over the top.Also, everything seems 'too easy' and 'too convenient'.  Everything the kids need falls in their laps.  They want to build a better shelter - a guy from a logging camp shows up.  A girl is pregnant - they find a nurse.  It would be interesting to see how the kids had handled the birth of a baby with no medical help.  It would have also been nice to see the kids fail once in a while.  I know there were bad guys around and they killed people and caused problems, but I'm not talking about that kind of thing.  It would have been nice if one of the kids ideas had not worked.  ""Lets make this...Lets build that"" and every idea works out perfectly.  That's not realistic.  It's ok to fail at a task.  People learn from their mistakes and people can learn from reading other people's mistakes too.I'm all for supporting new authors, and I do give the guy credit for coming up with a good idea.  I just wish he had proof read a little better and did some re-writes to fix parts of the story that don't flow well.  Also, the first chapter could be dropped completely and it would make the story flow much better. The first chapter sounds like a scifi novel from the 50s, then the rest of the book has a totally different tone.",0
"If you're looking for urban fantasy with lots of action, and don't mind typos, this is well-worth your time.Synopsis: Count Albritton, a self-styled paranormal investigator, begins by looking into an attempted burglary at the NYC apartment of one of his sorcerer friends. It doesn't take long for this seemingly routine investigation to turn into a battle for the future of the world.Storytelling: five stars. I'm not a fan of clich&eacute;s like ""can't put it down,"" but that was almost how it was for me. I kept picking up my Kindle at odd moments during the day to take in a couple chapters. When my battery got low, I pulled it onto an iPad and kept reading. Lots of action and no long stretches of boredom to counter it. Sexual tension is present, but no explicit sex scenes for those who are offended by such. Character development was okay, we learn more about each of them as we go, but the villain was just a little too two-dimensional.Writing: four stars. If you are put off by a story told in first-person present tense, that's what this is. I didn't notice until I was a few chapters in, though. About a third of the story is a flashback to events that happened before (the story begins with Albritton in a hospital, recovering from various injuries from those events) -- that was a little gimmicky, but the story itself was strong enough to overcome it.Editing: three stars. No glaring continuity errors that I saw, the story itself holds together very well. There are far too many copyediting problems though: dropped words, typos, and so on. That cost the book a five-star rating overall. I hope a second edition, and any sequels, addresses this issue.",1
"No Lord of the Flies here. Alien based fog takes over most of the world below a certain elevation. Most camp counselors leave to contact others down the mountain and don't return. Remaining counselor vegges out. One of the younger kids does what's needed and ends up in charge of the mountain and has to deal with bad bikers, a farm woman and her kids and some trapped army types.  I would recommend this to anyone 12 and up and think it would make a great movie.",1
"One word that describe this story... HOT!I am a huge fan of Vivian Arend's Granite Lake Werewolves series and was really excited when she sent me this other one of hers. Specially since it is about a new sort of shifter and from the blurb I could see that a lot of hotness was to be had heheThe Forces of Nature is about Merfolk, men and women that shift into dolphins. How freaking cool is that? I love dolphins and it was great to read about a different kind of mythology, ona that I hadn't seen before.Tidal Wave tells the story of Alexia, who doesn't know she is part of a merfolk clan, but when she goes help out her supposedly senile Grandmother, finds out that not only she is a dolphin shifter but she is set to be the next clan leader.The proximity to the sea and the clan start affecting her hormones and giving out signs to the single males of the clan. She need to choose one or more to help her body get the hormones she needs to be able to shift.When you think nothing can be sexier than a Hot dolphin shifter, you realize that reading about Alexia's budding relationship with Joshua and Anthony definitely puts you your place.I have to say, WOW! Tidal Wave brought out the HOT and got me all hot and bothered. I literally blushed at times and had to take a little brake.If you enjoy Paranormal Erotica, you really need to check this series out! The second book, ""Whirlpool"" comes out in August, and I'll be reading and reviewing it soon =)Originally Posted at Welcome to Larissa's Bookish Life {larissaslife DOT com}",1
"This was a pretty good short story.I found myself laughing and yelling at the book during different scenes. I love 'take charge, sexually aggressive men' and Milo is it. I couldn't help but wonder if Maya truly deserved him. I'm not going to give you a synopsis, but I will say that its the typical office romance where mis-communication causes people to act like fools. Although the story was mighty short, I was still entertained. And, the sex scenes were great. Who doesn't like those uninhibited, freeing, honest sexual experiences? Good god... I remember being reckless. LOL Anywayyy... it's a fun, fast read. So, for less than $2, you can't go wrong.",1
Just okay. Not the same tension and heat as the other books. Still a great series and worth picking up.,0
Beach read,0
Exciting story full of twists and turns. It really showed differing viewpoints and positions related to slavery in the United States.,1
The writing and plot was not my cup of tea. This does not mean you won't like it so give it a shot especially if Amazon offers it as a free download.,0
I only read part of this book. I just couldn't get into this story. Maybe you will? I guess I just wasn't in the mood to read a story like this when I got it.,0
The protagonist in this story is a very clever fellow indeed. Only Frank Herbert writes such cerebral short stories.I recommend this short story.,1
"If you have been cheated on, read this, you can turn your life around. Holiday of a lifetime becomes love of a lifetime.",1
"I first heard about the book when the Author decided to put a post on the kindle forum, he was offering a free autographed cover of this book to put on your kindle, which I got (Thank you Mr Tangerine).The description of the book seemed quiet interesting so I said why not, even though I am not familiar with the author, let's try it ! well, I am glad I did !First, the story is really different, I like the fact that we have different angles of the story throughout the book.Second, I won't spoil the fun here, but the ending is so different from what I thought it would be, I loved it, I love not being able to guess what will happen !So really, if you don't mind paying $0.99, please read it, you won't be disappointed !",1
"I got this book because I liked the cover art on the book and it was free.  Even though it was free it was a big waste of time and I only read about 1/3 or it!!!  I understand that I writer will occasionally use cuss words but I think F*** was used at least 2 to 3 times on each page which seems like really bad writing to me.  Also what is up with using the work arse (which I assume is suppose to be as*), this word was also way over used and irritating.  Im not a prude and my husband cusses all the time but I have never seen it used so much in a book and hope not to see it this much again.",0
"Excellent mystery with a lot of confusion throughout, yet when it was revealed at the end made sense without a stretch of your imagination to see how it could be. Simple hero without the bigger than life persona so often used. I could have been there myself and was in my mind. Recommend.",1
"This story was great. It is original and the premise is believable. The story is a natural for a sequel. What the fog has done to the land and people, as it recedes and where did it come from.",1
"The character concept is interesting. There are moments of humor with a good flow to the words. However, the ""after school special"" message of believing in your self and referring to female anatomy in feline terms contrasted enough to be jarring. A little super model humor goes a long way.",0
Not much more than a constant romp in the hay as they say.  A little less of that kind of filler of falling in and out of bed would be a good start on a better book.  Story not too bad when you get through the boring fluff of he did she did stuff.,0
This book kept my attention from the very first page until the ending. I could see myselfin the position of the escapees and how they managed to survive with the help of themysterious person. The ending was quite a surprise.,1
i think suspense means you should be wondering who did it?  i found no suspense and found the story just atypical of many others,0
"I brought this book because I always wanted to read a book by this author and I was attracted to the beauty and the beast themed-story line.Hunter was in a devastating accident that left him with a scarred face and a scarred heart.  After the accident he threw himself into his work to escape feelings of loneliness and rejection. He believes his appears makes people view him as a hideous beast.Lila will do anything to make sure her father is happy and healthy.  So when Hunter makes her an offer that will save her father's business she doesn't refuse and agrees to be his live-in mistress for three months.The book delivers a good message; physical beauty is fleeting while inner beauty is everlasting.I definitely had a problem with Lila's first night at Hunter's mansion.  I think that part of the story would have been better received by readers if Lila did not give into to Hunter's demands until she was ready.  Yes Lila agreed to the deal, yes she knew she would had to eventually fulfill her obligations and yes she was attracted to Hunter but Lila should have been able to set the pace for their relationship and not Hunter.  I feel that the author should have given that power to Lila and not Hunter and that is why other reviewers had issues with.Because of the Lila's first night I had a hard time reading the sex scenes.  I do believe that Lila saw more in Hunter than just his scars but the first night just set the tone for me and turned me off.If the first night would have been written any different, I think I would have enjoyed this book very much.  Although he was a complete jerk, I think the author did a good job with Hunter's character as I was able to feel empathy for him.  I definitely would have like to see more redeeming qualities surface before the ending.Would I recommend this book to a friend?  No!",0
I felt a lot of emotions with Z and Bella. Loved this to pieces! The series is amazing and would recommend to anyone!,1
I do not like reading this book because it is full of blood and violence throughout the book. I did a lot of skimming over the violent parts of this book. I do not recommend this book for children and young adults.,0
"After reading King Solomon's Mines I was looking forward to this book. But try as I might, I just couldn't get into it and didn't enjoy reading it at all. I deleted it from my Kindle.",0
"The story has great potential as a full length, but it leaves you wanting . . something. I like that some characters are well developed in this short--but some are just not developed at all. One character is brought forth and then abandoned completely, and I really despise loose ends. I love the lead heroine and ""hero"", I just wish there had been more packed in the punch. It is a quick read :)",0
"This is the story of Devin, a skittish diva who is running from love and Erik, the man hell bent on chasing her crazy behind until she admits she loves him and is ready to move their relationship to the next level. I LOVED this short story to pieces!!!Erik is in love with Devin and has asked her to move in with him. Devin, afraid of living the hellish life her parents lived, is gun shy when it comes to commitment and decides moving in with Erik is going too far too fast so she dumps him.The chase and capture is funny as all get out! Devin finally relents under what I can only describe as the sexiest, most sensually erotic siege it has ever been my honor to behold. I wish I could give this more stars.Well done!**BEST READ: with a glass of Blackberry Merlot and chocolate dipped strawberries! Have your little black book handy, you might need to call in reinforcements LOL!!!",1
"A cute and fast read about two people who are different in some ways except their attraction and eventually look for each other.A widow surprises herself what it feels like to truly love.  I would, though, have enjoyed more to the story and more to some of the other characters.Adeline. :)",1
"The book is alright if you want to chew the fat without eating the steak. I never finished it because of that. The story kept going without getting any where. Different races were introduced and information was repeated again and again and again.No build up, just let down. Not a good start for book one, I won't be getting book two or three or four...",0
"This was an inspiring article.  I hesitate to call it a book, as it is too short to qualify as a book.  Nonetheless, it inspired and comforted me.",1
"I thought this was a rambling short story, hard to hold my interest even as short as it is.  It is written mostly in first person and jumped from one memory or thought to another.  Sometimes they were related and sometimes they did not seem to be.  All the other reviewers to this point liked it, but it was definitely not for me.",0
"Though this is under 60 pages, i still found the story between Henry and Arsen a satisfying read. I like that Henry is tall and bulky yet shy and though Arsen seems aloof we see that there is a gentle side to him, especially the way he treated Henry after finding out his past lover had abused him. This truly is a very sweet and yes hot novella!",1
"This book was a great, quick, sexy read. My issues with with the very thin plot. To me, it was like an underdeveloped version of ""Hot Head,"" taking place in college instead of a firehouse. It could have used another 50 or so pages of buildup and depth. I'd still read this again. What can I say, I'm a sucker for ""gay for you"" books with tall, hot guys!",0
"This book was great it doesnt seem like i could find words to describe how happy I am I bought this book.This book is very emotional it has it all, love, pain, sadness, fear, forgiveness and family.Love of not only of Luc and Skye, but love for family, of a mother to her child, love of siblings and love of tradition. Pain of betreyal is sompalpable in the beginning i honestly dont know how skye could forgive but i understood that her love for Luc was to great that she doesnt want him to loose anything. For me it was very couragious of her to face her fear of meeting Luc's father who caused her so much pain.I know this review is very criptic but i want u guys to read it. It very worth it.",1
"I love Brenda Jackson, she is the best ever. I like the way it all come together. Big happy family......(Westmoreland)",1
"I know it's meant to be short, but it still didn't have enough development to make me care if I read it, nor did I really care what happened to the characters.  Meh.  I guess I need to lower my expectations for free items.",0
This was a great story about a miner who goes into town to get supplies for the winter that is nipping at his heels and when he finally gets home he finds a woman tucked in with his supplies.  Boy his two room cabin feels much smaller when he has to share it with a fiesty blond woman who he doesn't need or want.  Their relationship definitly starts off rocky but by the end of the six months they find they really don't hate each other after all.,1
"This is a really great book.  The characters are expertly developed, and there are many other characters introduced throughout the story (so there is no 'island, and this is all you get' feel).  Also, the story begins with almost fifty young people, and with the addition of some outsiders, I was never left feeling like there wasn't enough to draw a good story from.The only real unbelievable part of the story, for me, was the 'Chief': a thirteen-year-old boy who took over as the leader of the camp.  During the age (adolescence) when testosterone abounds, an older boy most certainly would have tried to capture the flag from protagonist Mike.The story is expertly developed, and the kids from the camp met with a great ending.  There are some wholesome, rule- and ethics-based aspects of the story, and I was sad to see it go for this reason.Overall, I recommend this.",1
"The author desperately needs to learn to write in first person present tense...or any other present tense.  All the ""she had woken the next mornings"" and ""she groaned as she had remembered"" were almost unbearable to read by the time I got to the fourth chapter so I had to take a third break from reading the book.  There were even a lot of sentences with multiple hads/haves.  Also, this plot is an update to a harlequin romance from the 70s, so really isn't original (not saying the author ever read it, but the 2 Greek Shipping company guys with the 2 British sisters and the mistaken identity while the real couple are free to runoff and elope is a book I read way back when people actually were rich from owning cruise lines.  Which brings me to the implausibility factor.  I read these books for fun, fantasy, escape, so I don't have too much issue with the fact the plot really was extremely unlikely, but coupled with the writing, it just made the flaws more obvious.I got this book for free but would not recommend anyone actually pay for it.***I read some of the other reviews which suggested the book was edited a few months ago....I only got it in Sept. and it was definitely not edited.",0
Book was cute but did not realize it was a mini story.  Wish there has been more content to the story line. Gave it a 3 star,0
An emotional rollercoaster. Cheering for both characters. Emotionally strong female heroine to overcome tough obstacles in a tough hero.A fantastic read.,1

"Opposites attract. This seems to be the basis for the novel and the love between a woman's who's spent her life being scared of risk and loss, thanks to a big, predictable and over-dramatic ""secret"", and the solar, carefree Aidan. The story line lacks direction and purpose, in the sense that the whole of the plot seems invented as a means to fill in the gaps around Aidan and Hannah's relationship and feelings for one another.As for ""learning to swim"", it does not feel like Hannah is really letting go of her fears.There were some good parts about the parent-child relationship, but mostly I was plain not convinced by the book.",0
"I love most of Evangeline's books, but this is not one of them. This is nothing against the writing; as always Evangeline does a great job of writing a story. My problem is that I have no interest in her male/male books and think it should be clearly stated in the book description. It was not! Had the free sample to read been a page or two longer, it would have been clear when the men began kissing. Had the three previous book reviewers stated this, I would have known to avoid the book. I even went to the author's website (before buying the book) where her books are broken into themes, M/M being one of those, but this book was not listed as a M/M. If this is your thing, then by all means buy the book, but if you are opposed to M/M kissing and oral sex, avoid! The two star rating is for Amazon not stating this was a M/M book; Evangeline's writing style is worth four stars, but I want anyone thinking of buying the book to know what they are getting.",0
"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first, but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok, it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So, I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you.",0
"For the first time in my extremely long erotic reading life, I had to skip the menage sex scenes in a book. Which really was bad since it was the main reason I chose it. I prefer my menages to have the m/m be involved with each other, so this story seemed to be perfect to me when I read the blurb. But goodness me, the scenes read like really bad cyber sex interactions. The sentences seemed to not flow together, which took me right out of the sex scene. That should not happen when sex is involved.The story itself was good, which is why I kept reading, but this writer had a hard time when it came to the characters voices, especially when they were speaking to each other.The word please was used so much that my kindle froze as I was trying to keep track of the number of times it came out of the mouth of the heroine.Also, please lose the amount of !!!! (exclamation points) that for some odd reason was put at the end of almost every utterance leading up to and during the sex scenes.I really would like more stories starring these three, but not until the writer gets a thesaurus and some more experience in writing about sex.",0
"Couldn't believe how the father revealed his past to his daughter.  Every convicted criminal pleads &#34;not guilty&#34; and never owns up to the truth, even if it was caught on film.  A far stretch of the imagination.",0

"Stan Morris hit the jackpot with his first novel. ""Surviving The Fog"" was a joy to read. Normally a book could take me a couple of weeks to read. This book took only three days. Morris grabs your imagination with this story about some stranded kids and their battle to survive.The flow of his book was awesome. You stayed on the edge of your sit waiting to find out what happened. Their were many errors thru out the book. This is to be expected with a self publish first novel. With that said Morris did a great job.Just to make it known. I did receive this ebook from they author. He did not request a review and you can easily get this book on amazon.com for free.I highly suggest all readers check this book out. Follow the adventure of Mike,John, Howard,Desi, Yuie and many more young kids as they fight to survive.",1

"Coulters&#8217; Wife is a novella length romance.  (Please note where the apostrophe is in that title.)  Holly is &#8220;married&#8221; to three brothers, Ethan, Adam and Ryan.  The four of them live in an isolated location in the mountains and when the story opens, Holly is very pregnant with their first child.  She is upset because she wants to have sex, but the brothers agreed no more sex until after the baby comes.  The plot basically revolves around Holly getting the brothers alone and seducing them one by one.  When Holly goes into labor early, the brothers must work together to deliver the baby on their own.This book was creepy on so many levels.  I don&#8217;t really have a problem with m&eacute;nage relationships, but brothers???  That&#8217;s just icky.  Then, they live up on this mountain semi-isolated from people&#8230;this is how bad religious cults are formed, not sexy love stories.  Add into the mix that they are bringing a child into the world whose family tree will go in circles and the hair on my arms prickled.  Okay, I know I got this story free off of Amazon, but even that was too much to pay.Overall, I give Coulters&#8217; Wife&#8230;Plot &#8211; 1 bookmarkCharacters &#8211;  bookmarkLove Story &#8211; Zero bookmarks (Major creep factor)Sex Scenes &#8211; 1 bookmark (Uninspired)Dream Cast (otherwise known as who I pictured while reading) &#8211; I didn&#8217;t bother getting engaged enough to cast the roles.

"What the blurb doesn't tell you is that the main character is a divorced 40+ woman/cougar looking for a quick one night stand with a younger man. No talk, no feelings she just wanted a nice night. The man happens to be a werewolves. After she finds out, she doesn't want anything to do with him anymore. If you don't mind reading about a 40+ that has been married for over 20 years. Than this is your book :)",0
"I love Ms. Dohner's other series, so I decided to try this one and was seriously disappointed.The heroine (human) comes to a were town while the mating heat season is in full swing. She's unaware such thing happens so makes mistake, gets into trouble (attempted gang rape) and is saved by the hero. So far so good. Then being her uncle's apple of the eye, she get's a bodyguard, ta-dam, the same poor guy. He's ordered to protect her and not to touch under the threat of being castrated.However, the heroine suddenly decides she wants to get in bed with him, even though she knows about her uncle's orders, threats and character in general. When she doesn't get what she wants, she starts behaving like a spoilt 5-year old brat trying to provoke the hero but gets into near-rape situation again. Then he has to mark her in order to get her out of this mess and she's not happy the guy isn't over the moon about it.I'm all for independent strong-willed assertive heroine but these qualities do not equal stupid stubbornness and creating mess all around you just to get what you want.Will try the second book in the series to see if it improves, probably, or will just wait for next New Species book.",0
So reading the blurb I thought racy story about two people trapped in a cabin. Sounds ok. What I wasn't prepared for was the sweet romance and good story.  Both  Genevieve and Alex have been hurt in the past. I liked the way Alex had such an open mind about Genevieve's special talents. He didn't try to explain them away or ignore them. Genevieve was much less excepting of her talents than Alex was. Being on her own for so long with major preconceptions about her past actions and character. It was great to see Alex blow her preconceptions out of the water.These two were down to earth and I liked seeing them get to know each other.  They saw each others supposed flaws and strengths so differently.  It was obvious they saw things in each other that hadn't been uncovered and would lead to change in the future.  This was the first book I read by Alisha Rai and I liked her style.  This book was a good mix of relationship building and steamy encounters. It was a standalone book and from what I can see she doesn't have any plans to turn it into a series. Which is fine sometimes it's just nice to read a great story!,1
"""The Death Trip"" is a book that manages to approach a controversial topic yet not force an opinion on the reader.  It was interesting to look at both sides of the topic, and the great writing style of the author made it enjoyable as well.Setting/Story - There isn't much of a setting given at the beginning of the story, but there is enough of one to start the book off without the reader being confused.  It starts out with an older woman named Vera being given the option to take a drug that will give her a ""Death Trip"" which is slightly like euthanasia.  The patient is given a drug that lets them dream a wonderful dream that appears to them to last years while it truly only lasts a few minutes.  Meanwhile, they die a peaceful death (NOTE: it is explained in much better detail in the book, and this complex procedure is explained very simply to the reader).  After Vera has made her decision whether or not to take the ""Death Trip"" the story moves to her grandson, Chuck, who is a reporter/blogger.  He becomes interested in the study through his grandmother and sets out to meet with the creators of the ""Death Trip"" while trying to help his internet girlfriend find out if they are up to something evil with this procedure.Writing Style - The writing style of Marion Stein is very interesting and easy to keep up with.  While everything is explained in great detail so that the reader can understand all the scientific aspects of the book, the story is able to remain extremely intriguing throughout these explanations.  The story does deal slightly with the controversy of euthanasia, but it does not try to force either side on the reader at all; it states each side's views diplomatically and shouldn't offend the reader's beliefs.  Also included are just a few typos, but they are minute and no problem at all.  Lastly, there was no attempt to hide product or company names in the book, and often real companies or people would be included to give the story realism.  It was slightly awkward at times but, like the typos, it didn't detract from the book much at all.Warnings - Language; SexOverall, this is a book that is very difficult to put down.  It exudes an air of romance, suspense, and drama all in one to create a wonderful scientific mystery.",1

"Having visited Ford's Theatre  last year, I have never been so moved by a historical place. This short book nearly brought tears to my eyes. It was moving, absorbing, and passionate. What a wonder to take a brief trip back in time and almost feel like you were there.",1
This story reads like a Mills and Boon romance only a bit more disjointed.  There are plot holes aplenty and you have to wonder who actually approved this for print as some of them are just glaringly obvious and confusing to the overall story.,0
"Very brief story.  Enjoyable but not a lot to it.  The hero and heroine have been married long enough to fall into a rut.  The husband, a twin, has always wondered whether his wife might have preferred his brother (because the twins had swapped places a couple of times during the married couples courtship because the husband has always felt less socially adept than his twin).  The heroine has always been able to tell the difference between the twins and has never doubted she married the twin that she wanted to marry.  Still, they've settled into comfortableness and she wants passion (and she fears her husband may have strayed --though he hasn't).  Over breakfast she makes an outrageous statement about possibly taking a lover, jolting her loving if inattentive  husband into action.Nice story. Loving couple. It's just a short story, however.",1
This was my first audio book that I listened to all the way through. I really liked how the narrator wasn't monotone in her reading. I would have liked to get more on the story of Emma and the school dance and how Kaylee came into this gift. All in all for this book being free I was quite impressed on the over all story. Kaylee and Lydia's bonding was one of my favorite parts as well as Lydia sacrificing herself for Kaylee.,1
"The plot for this story was pretty common for Harlequin romances.A poor shopgirl (Alanna) meets the handsome and wealthy Leon and becomes his mistress. After they've been together for 6 months, he tells her that he will never marry her. She leaves and marries his brother.Five years later, they meet by chance and she knows Leon still hates her as he blames her for his brother's death. She has been wracked by guilt as she blames herself for her his death as well. Three months later, Leon tracks her down and discovers that she has a 4 year old son. He forces her to marry him so that the child will have a father figure and grow up in the wealth of an Andreokos.In the end, the truth about what Alanna did with her inheritance and her husband's death comes out.As I said, the story is nothing new, but the pages are packed full of emotion. The problem is that there is so much emotion and so many secrets and lies to uncover that the word limit just could not do it justice. This story really needed to have been told in a full-length novel for full impact.All in all, well worth the $0.99. THis was my first book by this author and now I will look for more of her work.",1
"Brenda does such a great job on her small town series, dundee  idaho is another one of her fabulous ones. I could not wait to read the next book once I finished  One.  Brenda has s real knack for really describing a small towns heart and soul in her characters.",1
"There's certain (sub-)genres I go into with high expectations. I have questions and I want answers. I want a specific thing told to me about what the genre is, it has to be believable, I want to be convinced on certain things but above that I want to be made to understand and believe them. Unfortunately, m&eacute;nages are at the top of that list. I need the story sold to me, to have it believable but it has to suck me in right from the beginning or there's no hope of redemption. That's a bit harsh, I know, and I'm sorry, but it's the way I feel with m&eacute;nages.With that said, this book frustrated me beyond belief. It didn't start off on a good note for me. The first 50% of the book is essentially just smut and for someone like me who prefers at least double the plot than smut, it was unbearable to get through. I was extremely close to calling this my first DNF but I agreed to stick it out until the half-way mark... Thankfully, the book finally caught my eye around that time (although it could have also been from the fact I cheated and skipped to certain parts of the book to see if I was actually wasting my time or not).Now, just to clarify, I'd say this book is made up of about 60-70% smut. Which I hated and resulted in me skipping those scenes. They were redundant, boring and unnecessary. Only a select few actually contributed to the story. The rest of it seemed like a page filler to me.It was hard for me to connect with the three MCs. For one, Luke, which is the only pov we get (in first person) is never actually described. So, I have no idea what he looks like and if he was described then I completely missed that because I don't remember any description about him regarding his appearances besides a reference to his father. Richard and Matthew, the other MCs, are perfectly described. But the thing is none of them know anything about each other. Like nothing. At ALL. They jumped into bed together at a club. Three times. Agree to go on a date. Still know nothing about each other. Then move in together. Still not knowing anything about each other. I didn't like it. Especially with the fact Luke didn't want to put Matthew or Richard into a situation of possibly getting hurt by his father but he still moved in with them when he knew his father would eventually find him and seek to make their lives a living hell. Yeah.....Anyway, so, yeah. I was frustrated throughout most of the book. To me, the relationship wasn't believable. I still don't understand their relationship. Yeah, at the end, you can tell they loved each other but it was made impossible for me to love them because there was no dialogue between them getting to know each other. What we know of them is what Luke gave us in brief summaries of what he learned from their 'dates'. Well, I wanted to actually experience those dates. Instead, I got the smexing after the date.Needless to say, I didn't much like this book. I couldn't connect with the characters or their relationship, the smexing put me off so much from the start there was barely a chance of redemption for this story. With that said, I did appreciate Sloan Parker's writing. It drew me in when the smut didn't overpower the pages. That's what captured my attention and made me want to keep reading when all I wanted to do was complain about the book. I was ready to give up on it but then the smexing lessened slightly and her words drew me in. The conflict revolving around Luke's father was a bit cliched and unbelievable but it still made me stick with the story.Overall, I'm sorry, I can't recommend this book. I never connected with the characters. I still feel as if they don't really know each other and none of it was believable to me.",0
"Interesting premise with 3 authors creating connected characters in a series. There was definitely a different 'voice' or style to each author's writing, but I found I liked them all.The stories each had a touch of fantasy, sci-fi, steampunk, fbi-agent, and paranormal tied together to keep it fun.This book was more enjoyable as I realized there was continuation book with Hell-Cop 2, and I had to go out and purchase to see how it continues with the same three authors.",1

"I picked up this paranormal romance quite some time ago when it was free. If formatting and grammar don't bother you, then you'll enjoy it. If it's a pet peeve, you might not be able to get beyond the first chapter.Femilla, the goddess of Womankind, has a duty to right grievious wrongs committed against women. As such, there are men in her keeping who are punished in the afterlife by the demon Demeana because they brutalized women when alive. Not all are beyond redemption, but must prove their rehabilitation. Andrew Regent is one of these men. After his death in 1509, he was tortured in the afterlife. But every one hundred years he has a chance. He returns to mortal life for a month. If he can find a woman to love who loves him in return, he will be saved. If he doesn't, he must withstand another hundred years of torture before he can try again. Many do not make it, give up and are consumed by the demon. It is now 2009 and Caitlin is his chance at salvation. As they get to know one another, Caitlin starts dreaming of the life of another woman, Catherine, the woman whose death caused Andrew to be condemned in the afterlife.This is a typical time travel/time slip romance which is fairly predictable. The characterization is excellent. The story, while a bit trite at times, is well constructed and dialogue is good. It is well plotted and consistent. But the formatting errors are crazy-making, so much so that I almost didn't finish the book. There are some grammar errors which also really distract, such as the Hero having ""chaffed"" ankles, and the Heroine feeling better after her morning ""adulations"". Oh, and Andrew is a ""genus"" with old weapons. I wonder what his species is?And this may seem minor, but glaring errors in covers really bug me. For instance, in the story Andrew is supposed to be blonde and the cover model obviously isn't. Yes, he's yummy, but it just doesn't fit. Additionally, you never put on bracers before putting on your shirt, unless you plan on fighting without one which frankly only happens in Conan movies and Frank Frazetta artwork.Before writing this, I checked the current publication date to see if maybe I just had an out of date download. But apparently that isn't the case and shows a lack of care and/or professionalism as several other reviewers have mentioned the grammar and formatting issues in the past. It's quite a shame, because this book could be a 3.5 or even 4 star work with just a bit more effort.",0
"While I have read most of the other books in this series,an I enjoyed them. The Darkest Fire was my least favorite. If you can get this book from the library I recommend you to.",0
This was a really unexpected and refreshingly original book. The writing style was great with lots of flashbacks that helped give clues to the mystery woven throughout. The love between Conrad and Desert Rose was so pure and beautiful. Armand deserves his own book!,1
"""When people talk about the South being haunted, it's true.  But it's not the places that are haunted, it's the people.  They are trapped by all the stories of the past...""  (Location 89)The narrator of ""This is Not a Love Story"" by Lydia Peelle is a woman whose daughter has gone off to college and she is looking back on her youth because of some old photos that her daughter found while packing.When she was twenty-two, our narrator left Connecticut and went to a small town in Georgia to start what she thought would be a lifelong career as a photographer.  She saw the South as ""raw and dangerous and full of relics of a long-gone era."" (Loc 34) Despite her lack of creativity, what the South offered would more than make up for anything she might lack.  As many often do, she wished later on that she had listened to family's and friend's advice.  Finding Tommy, twice her age, was great fun in the beginning.  Tommy lived on a boat on the lake and didn't work, had parties all the time and drank a lot.  And the nights in Valdosta looking for Tommy in the bars started to get to her.  The title of the story is right.This is a very well-written short story and is the first of this author's writing that I have read.  There is an anthology with more of Peelle's short stories in it which I would like to read.  What happens in the story is believable and realistic and the characters are well-thought out and seem authentic.Highly recommended.",1

"This book has to be one of my top 10 favorites. I love the Character of Hunt Jamison; he was brutal, brazen, and honest to fault. He spoke what was on mind and found myself smiling and liking it. I felt bad for him at times because like Hunt I have a scar on my face from a car accident and I was embarrassed by it and sometime I'm still am, so I related to the character so much. I loved Lila character as well she tried her best not to fall for him while trying to keep her dignity. I like that the ""Write"" didn't make them fall in love so quick and like I said the honesty of Hunter and plain-spokenness is so needed in others writers' characters. I love the book and it was worth it. I read it in one night.My top 10 favorites1. Mistress to the Beast2. Her Russian Billionaire3. Fling in Paris4. Kidnapped by a Greek Billionaire5. Maid for a Billionaire6. Delaney's Desert Sheikh7. Weekend required8. Beauty and the Sheikh9. The Doctor's Secret Bride10. Blacking the Billionaire",1
"Even though the book was short, I enjoyed the story line and how fast it moved while reading.  I recommend it for an afternoon read.",1
"I enjoyed this one. It was just a quick read that gets you flustered. The story, while kind of unbelievable was still very entertaining.Hunter and Mason haven't seen Claire in ten years and yet they want to marry her and love her and be with her. Pretty hard to believe. Especially, since Claire gives in so easily.I liked it, great quick read.",1
It was a cute story and well written. The only problem is the ending was a little too open. Almost like the author might add more to it later if it did well. But it did stop at an ok point and i wasn't missing anything if i didn't get book 2. I would recommend this to others.,1
I have to say that I have read all of Bianca D Arc s books they are written so well these books are always good.,1
"Timelapse only got up to two stars because I think the author does a pretty good job of creating his alternative world. However, his main character, Alex, was totally unbelievable. As opposed to another reviewer who like him and was rooting for him, I was praying for him to be shot dead. I forced myself to finish the book so that I wouldn't write a bad review in case it had a great ending.Alex is supposed to be a fairly intelligent assistant professor at a university. Now I can understand when the transformation first occcurs how one might be in shock and possibly do some stupid things. But his stupidity never ended. He quickly surmised that the world was very different and very bloodthirsty, but every time he found something different he started to act up in so as to draw attention to himself and his companion, thus endangering their lives. He can't find all of his relatives in the registry, so he acts up in public. He discovers there are no libraries, so he goes running off in a huge distressed huff. For some reason he was totally surprised when his money was no good, even though he knew this world was dramatically different from his own. On and on - he was shocked when anything was different from his world. No one, and especially not a well educated history professor, is that stupid, over and over and over again. I found this not only unbelievable, but also extremely annoying.",0
Great for a middle of the day read. Stumbled across this and actually liked it. Interesting and held my interest. This makes for a great book for someone who likes to read but can't her into a book right then.,0
"Definitely had the ingredients for a great story, but something got lost along the way. Not up to par with the author's other works. I found myself having to think way too much in order to follow the storyline. Good characters, but too much confusion.",0

This was a book that I thoroughly enjoyed from the beginning to the end. The story line was full of details and kept me involved and entertained. I loved the characters and their quirks. The story was smoothly written . Secret agents and art. Who would have believed how much fun and add a twist of fate and  love.I will read this author again.Enjoy this book you won't be disappointed.,1
"This book was a homerun. There was a solid plot, deep characters that I came to care about, action, and some deep thinking moral issues. How do a group of teenagers survive the end of the world? The actions taken by the kids were plausible and just plain neat to read. I can only hope I am as resourceful as these kids were if alien space fog invades earth.",1
"I didn't enjoy this story.  It was so drawn out and, at times, downright boring! I really couldn't get a feel for how these characters looked---the author didn't paint a vivid picture for me.  In addition, I felt that the story wasn't well told.  So many details were lacking, especially the history of Sydney and Tyler's relationship.  What happened for them to break up? Had he always been crazy?  How did she not see this before?  For her to be such a feisty girl, why couldn't she have dealt with Tyler better?  I was not impressed with her hiding from him and nearly allowing him to rape her without much fight: ""At least she wouldn't be awake for it.""Now, let's talk about chemistry in the book.  The chemistry is quite tepid.  Sydney and Tyler kiss a bit, she gives him advice, they flirt, then they're headed to his hotel for sex. What??? I really would have preferred the book without the ONE sex scene. It was horrible.  The lackluster description of the sex is so vague I had to read it twice to be sure I was actually in the midst of a love scene!  This is definitely what I was expecting from a Wild Ride story, but then, I thought this author was comparable to Cat Johnston and Lorelei James.  Boy, was I wrong.  Even more frustrating, at the end of the book, I was surprised that Levi wanted a permanent commitment to Sydney.  Why?  There was no chemistry, mundane sex!Overall, poorly written book that left me desiring a REFUND!",0
"""When the two of them finally act on their mutual desire, everything around them fades away in the face of the blazing heat. And though it may seem like it takes a while for the story to progress to that point, the pacing fits the overall story and keeps it moving from start to finish. I enjoyed everything about this story and am extremely satisfied with the ending."" - Karin",1
"I felt like this author was in a race against time to finish this book . I was disappointed by the shortness of it .Woman gets thrown overboard ,gets rescued by seal man , has sex in front of everybody for binding ceremony and then off to make evil stepmother and stepsister pay , THE END ! (duh) If more thought had gone onto it ,I hope it could have been better . Now I'm iffy about this author .",0
Pretty decent read but not as good as the sequel. I found myself wondering about the secondary characters in stead of the main characters.,0
"Basically the title of three star reviewer sums it up perfectly for me why I hated this book. I can enjoy ""Daddy kink"" in the bedroom, really depends on how it was written, but for me eighteen year old Angel acted as if he was extremely young child and it was a massive turn off for me. The story is well written, but I could not deal with it.",0
The characters were the usual misunderstood but the storyline played out well.  Kept my interest and wanted to continually see what would happen.,1

"This is a short story enough to pass the time while waiting for your flight.A funny read that had me grinning that surely earned weird glances at the waiting lounge.The book was written in a way that makes you feel like you are in the room with them.This book would surely make you think before thinking of lying to your mother...especially if she's the kind of mom not to be messed with.After reading this book, I wondered, could there really be a man willing to do a farce like this to help someone out?The occasional grammar slips irked me; hence the three stars.Overall a good read.",0

"Ariel is kidnapped from earth by aliens to be used as a breeder. But since they are not genetically compatible with us, instead the aliens give her to their slaves as a prize. Sex slave for a slave. You would think that's the worst fate ever. But those slaves (the Zorn's) all look like a romance novel cover models. The only difference is they got very sharp teeth. Hey but look on the bright side - their sperm tastes like candy. TMI? Ok I will stop. :)The other thing that bothered me a lot is a built-in translator chip they all had it in their ears (so they could understand each other). I would expect the software to be much more sophisticated and not to translate even worse than a Google Translate website. So the Zorn people (who are way ahead of us technologically) sound a lot like Tarzan. ""Me Ral. You my woman. We have sex.""And don't get me started on 'sex chamber'. No, it's not a room on a ship, it's part of a female body. o.O",0
"The real star in this book is the author.  The writing, although somewhat baroque, is fascinating.  This is the product of a real wordsmith.  Considering when this was written and what the subject matter is, it's hard to put down.  The story, however, is a bit primitive.  I read the story before I found out they were making a movie of it.  Unfortunately the movie was a box office bomb.  If the film is true to the book, I can understand that because I don't think many would have read the book first and the real joy is in the writing, not necessarily the story.",1

"I enjoyed the premise of this story. The storyline however was a bit too abrupt for my taste. Because it was a novella, the story moves fast but seems like it leaves out a lot. The beginning of the story makes you feel like you're coming into something where the back story must have been given 50 pages prior. I'd love to see this book and the rest of the series as a full length novel. For now I'll just take this as a taste of what Ms. Teshco has to offer.",0

"This is the third of Ms. Druga's EOTWAWKI books I've read.  'Dust' was okay-ish, 'Sealed In' was real good, but this one reads like a first draft.  It has major editing, sentence structure, missing word, wrong word (I stopped counting at 15), research, continuity, and suspension of disbelief issues. These problems become more and more pronounced as the story progresses.To a greater or lesser extent, this seems to be a recurring problem with all of Ms. Druga's literary efforts.The story opens with the main protagonist Jen using a scope mounted rifle to shoot an infected.  Later on, when this same event is described, she uses a shotgun.The character Mack, a supposed expert 'gun maker and repairman' (the term for which, by the way, is 'gunsmith'), instead talks like an author who has no real grasp of firearms and firearms technology.  Later on in the story, Mack builds 'an anti-aircraft gun' and shoots down two ground attack aircraft with it.  'Anti-aircraft gun' is all the description given; no clue as to caliber, system of operation, or any other detail.I found the author's woefully inadequate grasp of military terms, tactics, equipment and operations particularly annoying.  It's just as easy to do a little research and get this stuff right as it is to just make stuff up based on what you think you know.And the same caveat with the fancy words - it's not a bad idea to make sure you actually know what they mean before you use them.Handled differently and given more (any) fact-checking, editing, and attention to detail, this could have been a hell of a read.  As it stands now, it didn't quite make me want to gouge my eyeballs out, but it did come close.  I'd strongly suggest that you pass this one by.",0
"I really enjoyed this book.  Kate, Bobby and Cale were so endearing that I didn't have a problem with them having a polyamorous affair.  I am not familiar with the concept of polyamorous relationships, but the concept just didn't seem at all odd while reading this story. Cale and Bobby are the closest of close friends who don't mind sharing a woman.  Kate is looking for a revenge sexcapade when her car runs off the road in a snowstorm that has closed the roads.  They pull her out of the creek and they spend the next few days enjoying the new ""friendship"" that happens during the storm. I'm definitely looking forward to reading more books from Delilah Devlin. Her characters were wonderfully written and the story was hot!",1

"Although Holly was starting to get on my nerves with her I just want a fling thing, it all ended well. A nice short story.",1
"I actually read the second book in this series, Primal Attraction, first.  Near the end of that book we are introduced to Kennedy and Tristan and I was intrigued.  I asked the author for a review copy of Primal Hunger immediately after reading Primal Attraction.  A weird way to read a series I know, but after reading Primal Attraction I was hooked and had to read Primal Hunger.Tristan Callaghan, a gargoyle shape-shifter, has a few problems.  Because of him, his brother Cian was cursed by a sorceress and trapped inside his stone form nearly a century ago. Tristan has dedicated his life to searching for a mystical dagger that may help break the curse and free his brother.  Nothing is more important and he has no time for distractions like the lovely Kennedy Beaumont.  Too bad his dual nature can't seem to come to terms with that.Kennedy works as bartender at Pendragon's, a bar that Tristan co-owns with his brother Cale.  She is human and has no idea that her sexy employer is actually a shape-shifting gargoyle and most of the patronage at the bar is also something other than human.  She just knows that mixing business with pleasure is never good and she needs her job more than a fling with the boss she can't get out of her head.When Kennedy's car breaks down on the side of the road one night after work, she's relieved when her boss happens upon her and offers her a ride home.  In an instant, all hell breaks loose and Tristan is drifting in and out of consciousness while Kennedy drives through the night running from who knows what, not knowing that she has just been thrust into a supernatural world she never knew existed.  Even worse an assassin has her in his sights and Tristan may be the one that holds the key to saving her life, but at the cost reversing his brothers curse.I'm actually glad I read these books out of order.  While I don't think someone reading Primal Hunger would be confused about the setting of the book and the history behind it, I do feel like I got a better understanding of the gargoyle curse, and the hunt for the daggers in Primal Attraction.  For me, the love story between Tristan and Kennedy shines in Primal Hunger and while the history of the shape-shifting gargoyles is interesting, it took more of a backseat to the romance.  Nothing wrong with that though, right?Tristan and Kennedy have denied their attraction to one another for some time, and I liked that I didn't have to read through two thirds of the book before they finally get together.  There's enough romantic tension between the two of them to make their rapid progression into a romantic relationship believable and although they don't jump into a full fledged physical relationship right away, they don't spend massive amounts of time fighting the feelings.  Granted, as a human, Kennedy has to go through the motions of understanding the new world she's been introduced to and she is not all that pleased to know she's been `claimed', she still seems to take it all in remarkably well.As paranormal heroes go, Tristan is gorgeous.  Alpha in all the right ways, willing to fight to the death for his mate, honorable to a fault and sexy as hell.  When in human form he still has that sexy cat thing going on.Kennedy is sassy, funny and a likeable heroine.  Although she's just become a pawn in the fight for an ancient relic sought after by dangerous immortals she manages to remain a sturdy character and seeks out a solution of her own at one point.  I enjoyed her no non-sense attitude and loved her sense of humor.Primal Hunger is another good paranormal romance by Sydney Somers.  It's a good start to a series with wonderfully erotic, romantic scenes, and enough action and adventure to keep the story moving along.",1
This series of love was just what I expected of Mrs. Jackson. She never disappoints! I've been a fan of hers for long time. I recommend all her series.,1
"Veiled eyes was just not what I wanted it to be. The beginning started off strong but, progressively went down hill. The romance that I needed to make the story really come together wasn't there.

"This book is part of the author's Rakehell series and I think it's up to about 14 books now. There is a core group of friends who went to Eton together and raised a lot of hell together, but then became each other's family of choice after some lost wives and children, some were crippled by war, some were disowned by family of birth for being too radical, etc... The group has changed and added on during the years, each man adding a few choice members, but the core group remains. Each book is about a specific member or adventure of the group, so it could be considered a stand alone, but as you get into the higher number books, it becomes more difficult to follow the story without knowing the supporting characters from that core group of family/friends.This book is about Ashkoda Paignton, a half Indian/half British doctor whom we first met when he was suffering from a debilitating disease and was only a teenager. His mother's use of Indian Ayurvedic medicine helped heal one of the Rakehells in the"" Model Master"". Since then, she met and married another of the group and had two children with him, making Ash the step son of one of the Rakehells.Returning home from London to join a medical practice, Ash comes upon a young woman he is acquainted with being mauled and assaulted in the woods. He rescues her, takes her to his home for his mother to examine and gets to know her better, finding out that her sister set her up on that disastrous"" carriage ride"" from which he rescued her.From the time Ellen is rescued by Ash, she's fascinated by his happy family, (his stepfather is her cousin), his political, spiritual and healing beliefs and his gentleness with her. She learns so much from his mother to help care for her own, who had a stroke. Ellen loves to hear about Indian culture and religion. But mostly, she's fascinated with Ash. He's the largest but most handsome man she's ever seen and even though she's normally nervous around men, Ash makes her feel so wonderful.Ellen has no qualms or problems merging Indian culture with British. In fact, learning about tantric practices sounds downright wonderful. But any time two cultures meet, someone's going to be upset, now just to figure out who's spreading nasty rumors before their relationship is tainted with some one else's lies.Heat factor hot.",1
"I enjoyed the atmospheric opening and the descriptions of the locales, but the story took about three times to tell as necessary. This wasn't helped by the fact that the heroine's decisions become increasingly difficult to comprehend and so much of the explanation of why she never does the obvious and logical thing each time she has a choice comes so late in the book that it's likely almost impossible for the reader to identify with her reasoning. She seems by far a weaker rather than a stronger character because of this. The final resolution seems equally incomprehensible; a good literary surprise comes as the inevitable twist that you should have seen coming, but this was simply out of left field.Some of the heroine's self-realizations are intriguing and well-written, but rather in the same way that the author repeats the same scenario over and over, she repeats these moments of self-awareness again and again.Two stars for the descriptions and atmosphere.",0
"I was first introduced to Rosamunde and Tynan in Rogues of Ravensmuir series, got to know them better in the Jewel of kinfairly series.

"Enjoyable, low key mystery. Plenty of murders but not too much violence (in the way they are handled). 60 year old, unemployed man, is caught  up in The Case of the Murdered Cheer Leaders. Along the way he comes into the orbit of one fellow high school student, from many years ago, who was still in the mood for love. He, himself, has also been warned that his efforts to help the remaining former students, will bring on him the same fate as was meted out to his female classmates. A warm, congenial book despite the grim subject matter, l found it quite pleasant. The hero is a good companion for the time it takes to read the story, so, too, is his  security guard buddy, and, even, most of the police on the case. The author writes well, the plot, though creaky is serviceable and the more relevant characters nicely sketched. I will happily now move on to other books by Moats.",1
"I was disappointed in this book. There are still good recipes in it, but some are just meat-centered recipes where they suggest you COULD make it vegetarian... I was excited to see a recipe for Tom Kha Gai (Thai Coconut Soup), yet in that recipe it only suggested in the introduction to the recipe that you could substitute tofu for the chicken, vegetable broth for the chicken broth and I think there was one more --- maybe soy sauce for the fish sauce. Now all that is true, but I was really expecting a recipe where it WAS a vegetarian version not just --- well, use vegetarian ingredients instead of what this recipe says. Not what the title suggests.Many of the recipes are really just links to online &#34;Instructables&#34; - which is not a bad thing at all, just sayin'.if you are not really looking for ONLY vegetarian recipes, then maybe this book IS for you.",0

"Interesting book about the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan in the 1800s etc. The Indian author Andrew Blackbird wanted to get an education, and was a hard worker, but the money that was sent by the US Government, was not really available to him, as the system, including agents and friends disposed of it first. Another documented case where the system of Indian Agents really did not work well for the Indians, but rather was used by the agents for their benefit. Typical where the system is captured by the persons operating the system, and not by the people the system was set up to serve. He did an excellent job of collecting historical information, and creating a english to the local indian tongue dictionary. A little gem of a book.",1
"The premise and basic plot for this book is not incredibly unique or creative.  Billionaire older brother kidnaps the wrong sister when he tries to save his playboy younger brother from making a big ""mistake.""  If you've ever read any Harlequin books, this premise will be very familiar.  However, whereas Harlequin books are edited and the plot generally follows in a concise manner, this book was unedited and all over the place in terms of character development, plot development, and writing style.I won't reiterate what many of the other posters stated regarding the incorrect and ubiquitous use of the word ""had.""  It starts in Chapter One and continues until the end.  Having been forewarned, I didn't try to make sense of it when I first came across it.  Because, when you first see the incorrect use of ""had"" you wonder if the character is having a flashback or something.  Then you realize, no, we are not going back in time; the author just didn't take any writing classes.  I ended up not even reading the ""had"" and automatically changing the sentence structure in my mind as I read it.So why is this a Harlequin book gone bad?  Because so much of the plot and characters just reeks of the typical Harlequin plot, but without the Harlequin delivery.  So much so, that it makes me wonder if this author was an avid Harlequin reader who one day decided to try her own hand at writing.  And I say this because I've read so many books that I've thought maybe I can write one too.  Only to realize that there is big difference between editing/critiquing/reviewing, and actually authoring a book.  As the other posters stated, an editor would have done this book a great deal of service.  Aside from the ""had"" issue, a good editor could have pointed out that the plot does not flow naturally, that the characters are just not developed enough (either make them very basic cookie cutter characters, or really flush them out), and just the general movement of the plot is entirely unbelieveable.Example: After kidnapping Diona, Nikias spends time with her going snorkeling and showing her around his island, etc., etc.  Now, if he was really the ruthless b**#$%&d; that the author tries to convey him as, then he would have completely ignored her while he continued with his own playboy ways.  I also find it unbelieveable that this brilliant self-made shipping tycoon didn't do the basic investigation necessary to know that Daryle had an older sister who was a nurse.  If you're going to spy on little brother, then do it properly.I'm glad the book was free, otherwise I would have felt ripped off. In fact, I still feel that the author should be paying the reviewers for the free editing critiques that we offer.",0

Paul Benate is one of those freakinly smart men that works soley on Goverment top secret projects. He knew 6 years ago he had no business getting involved with Jolene but he couldnt resist the strange pull she had on him.

But now that his worst fear has come to life - a terrorist wanting to kidnap Jolene to get him to coroperate with them - he has no choice but to have her brought to him.The new and improved Jolene doesnt take her husbands deception well. But even though she is mad at him the two of them cannot deny their strange attraction to each other is just as strong today as it was all those years ago.,1
i truly enjoyed this book. evie knows how to build then release sexual tension. if you are in need of a pleasant quicky you will enjoy this book.,1
This series is super! Each story has such a great hero and heroine. They each a have a fun quirky storyline. The sex scenes are hot! Loved being in bear creek for a few hours. Will definitely be buying more Lori Wilde books.,1
"As outlined in intro - don't get or read if you cannot handle graphic descriptive writing based in serial killing.  Sociopaths have no conscience, no sympathy and no empathy.  Thus, when they are describing their acts to us (or their victims) it is gonna be ugly.  And this is ugly in many of the things done.  However, I was not shocked or offended (even though I admit it was pretty gory and graphic).This book tells the tales of two people - one who picks up hitchhikers and one who hitchhikes. And a couple of people they encounter along the way to meeting up.I just was put off by the feeling of contrivance related to the ending.  While action packed to the last ""drive, "" it felt like it was just an ending to end.  Rather than a true end from having gone through paces.So so read due to unfulfilling (to this reader) end.  If any are THINKING about this short (more than half the ""book"" is intro, author interviews and excerpts from other books) I suggest downloading sample chapters (or peek in preview) to see if you would even want to insert the gory images in your mind.  Many will be upset (many will not) .I prefer the voice and excerpts from J.A. Konrath.  Your mileage may vary.Christine",1

"Book 2 of Bell's ""Halle Pumas"" series. Preceded byThe Wallflower. Followed byCat of a Different Color.Books 1 to 3 are available as a paperback anthologyMating Games.Plot:Simon has to change Becky after her attack by the BadWerePuma, but in the midst of the Mating Glow, something's very wrong. Becky's sick and Simon needs to find the cause.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting) SmallTown romance with explicit bedroom scenes.- 1885 kindle locations, 20,000 words (short novella), but finishes around 1590 locations.- m/f - explicit, reasonably frequent, *happy*.- ""Sweet Dreams"" picks up at the end of Book 1, just as Livia attacks Becky.- Becky's BFF had her story told in Book 1The Wallflower. As a ""series"", the first three books should really be seen as a trilogy where the stories support each other. You *could* read them independently, as stand alones, but would get more satisfaction from reading them in sequence.- Includes excerpts fromImmortal Illusionsby Ursula Bauer,Tyger, Tyger Burning Bryghtby Cathryn Cade, andThe Wallflowerby Dana Marie Bell.- There is a ""free read"" available on the author's website which gives us a little epilogue of Simon and Becky, ""The Ornament Book 2"".Opinion:""Sweet Dreams"" is a *nice* paranormal romance. It is an easy read with a human-puma mating including her being turned (unexpectedly) by Him, and plenty of explicit, happy sex to cement the relationship. It has lol one-liners, a clever, strong woman who is willing to accept the Dominant Alpha thing, while putting him in his place with snarky pet-names. It's a good book in a nice series. Recommended.""The Ornament Book2"":Simon takes Christmas lights a little too far, but when Becky sees her *real* present, we all know they're heading for a hot'n'sweaty night.A nice little Christmas epilogue that makes me smile. Thank you Ms Bell.-CR-",1
"This is a quick, steamy read from beginning to end. Though they had both been eying each other for months, Mike's rescue of Kate as she slips down her roof is what really brings them together. Mike's actions show exactly what kind of man he is and his acceptance of Kate's desires proves how right he is for her. Likewise, Kate's stubbornness and determination are shown through her reaction to her fall. It is Mike's tenderness that gives her a sense of security which allows her vulnerability to surface.The relationship between Kate and Mike is the main focus of the story, but Kate's exploration of her sexuality drives the action. All of the sex scenes are scorchingly hot, but there is also an element of caring that shows the depth of emotion of everyone involved.Jayne Rylon has written a thoroughly enjoyable read that will satisfy anyone who likes their sex scenes as hot as they come. - Karin",1
"This collection comes with 4 stories.  I only slightly enjoyed one of them - the one about the civil war ghosts.Overall, I have to say, these are THE most boring ghost stories I've EVER had the misfortune to read.  Don't waste your time.",0
"This is a very hot short story. I got this thinking it was a Christmas story, but it's not, though there IS a snow storm.Sera (phina) is an empath who had fled her New Hampshire home after her NYPD-turned-small-town sheriff boyfriend Jake broke her heart. They had been making love, and for the first time, she gave him the full Monty, mind to mind. He didn't let the doorknob hit him on the ass as he raced away.Now Sera's back, having learned to better control her powers, Jake has done a little growing up and research. A freak snowstorm traps them together, and provides the excuse that of course Sera has to take off all of Jake's clothes, and her own, to warm him up and save his life. (How many times has this been done?) Still, they're both likable characters, Cody the dog adds a humorous touch, and the sex is hot. Enjoyable, and I'd like to read more by this author.",1
The second of book of series.Clint finds out that he has a son but Abby told her son his father is dead.Abby left home after Clint and her made love and left before she found out she was pregnant.  Her father has just died. Abby is almost engaged.Clint has loved h is best friend since high school but her father warned him off. Since the night they slept together Clint has not dated anyone.Its a nice romance.,1
"I could have gone without all the I love you, I love you too, I love you more type of writing. This was to drawn out, the story would have been good at half the length.  Also to many editing errors for me to enjoy and I don't remember reading a book that had what someone was thinking in quotes, that was weird. I only got 40% thru it and gave up.",0
"First of all let's look at what makes USA Today readable in its print version:It is concise,well written and tries to cover all the major international,national and domestic news stories in an easy to read, user friendly format. It may not offer the intellectual brooding of papers like the NY Times but it also does not trivialize news like the New York tabloids.The USA Today just gives us the basics.In this regard it is ideally suited for the Kindle since the paper's format makes it easy to catalog and present news in its simplest form.The only reasons it gets 4 stars:1. The price needs to be lower since it is not published on weekends.2. I still am reserving the 5th star for the day when technology can make Kindle incorporate graphics,comics,crossword puzzles etc;",1
This was an interesting story.  I will never think the same about Walt Disney's fairy princesses again.  You couldn't help but root for the heroine and her tenacity. The end was completely unexpected to me. I recommend this book to fantasy lovers.,1
"I have enjoyed these short fairy stories a great deal. They're just the right length to read one or two on the bus ride to work, without having to stop & forget my place. There are a lot of similarities between some of these stories and European fairy tales. I quite like this collection!",1
"What a lovely look at the journey some might take to love.  This is a wonderful treatment of &#34;gay for you&#34;.  Cooper Davis has done a wonderful job of character development, realistic emotions and engrossing dialogue.  It is nice to see the author take the time to have the readers understand how someone &#34;straight&#34; can fall so hard for someone of the same sex.  especially they consider a best friend.  While the story is told from Hunter's POV, you get to know Maxwell as well.  Hunter's journey to Max is very well done.  Highly recommended.",1
Wow kept me reading faster.. and faster. kept me on the edge of my seat.  when you come to the end it will shock you . Excellent read.,1
"I wanted to give this book more stars but I couldn't because honestly it doesn't really feel like a ""book"". It feels more like an episode. It is such a shame because I LOVED the first one and I was hoping for something similar here but was disappointed.(Truthfully I was hoping the same for the last three books of the series but my hopes have been for naught) There could have been sooooooooo much more done with the story elements presented for Jek's and Bryn's story, while still giving clues to the inter-arching storyline the author has created that has spanned over the course of the series. That she didn't take the opportunity to write more scenes, to just give more like she did in the first book, is a real disservice to the worlds and characters she has created.  Really quite shameful.",0
I enjoyed it. I love light reads and love stories and a little added adventure made it fun. Nice writing style.,1
"Typical sentence--His lap swimming also resulted that he was in the best shape...Good idea for a story, good victim, couldn't read further",0
"I got this because I was only familiar with the novels.  The shorter works are interesting, but I haven't read all of them.  It is slow reading.  I can see the development of her style of commentary on the social situation of her time.  The format of letters is a little confusing to follow, but worth the effort.",1
"The author calls Robin a &#34;take charge girl&#34; but over and over she is having to be rescued by Simon!  This book is tedious and predictable. It is following the time honored romance form of boy meets girl, boy and girl bicker and argue all the while resisting mounting sexual tension, yada, yada, yada. I tried. Really I did but I finally gave up. I am not finishing this book. I just can't stand it. There is no depth, no redeeming side. Please save your money and find another novel.",0
I fully enjoy this series of books. The angels were introduced in the Lords of the Underworld series and I can't get enough of them. This series about the angels looks to be just as good as the Lords. Love them keep them comming please.,1
"Although I read more paranormal romances than anything else, I really enjoyed this romance without any of the paranormal elements I'm used to. In fact, I think this might be my favorite book by Carolyn McCray. Very well written and great romantic heat between the two main characters.My biggest complaint? I don't feel like everything was resolved. It needs a sequel!",1
Very choppy. It is as if paragraphs or pages vanished. Things woulc just appear and conversations would start in the middle or end leaving you saying when was that said or how did that get there and yes the cover was bad.,0
"If you are into sleazy old men takIng advantage of young girls then this is the story for you. It was one of the most horrific stories I have ever picked up. Needless to say it was quickly put down. If anything, the only redeeming thing about this story is teaching me that even I have standards in what I read.",0
"Damn. I bought this after really enjoying the Spark series.Big mistake.I stopped after the first escape attempt was followed by the first episode of sexual degradation.Writing like this perpetuates and reinforces the notion  that women like to be kidnapped  and raped.What answer would you get from the latest escapees in Cleveland, among so many other unfortunate women who have been kidnapped into sex slavery?You should be ashamed of yourself, Ms Dawn - especially as you can write much, much better than to use this cheapest of cheap tricks for so-called ""romance"".I won't buy any more of your books.",0
"On a scale of should i sit with the kids and play majong or should i read this book. know i know i should have sat with kids and played majong. The book tried to keep you in the sci-fy with an added kick of some hot n sweaty sex with an alien. It turned into skinny odd furry alien doctor against fat mean furry self abosorbed ass asking for our leading lady's hot sex. It was not hot, just odd. Nope this was a hurry up and get through it read. there are better hotter and wetter sci-fy erotica.",0
"What happens when two psychotic minds come together?  A story that will make the reader gasp and race through pages at lightening speed.  I have not read anything else by these authors, though I do have more of Jack Kilborn's works in my TBR pile, including Afraid.  I knew going into Serial that this was not a story for the weak stomached nor the easily offended.  Yes, it is gory, graphic and incredibly visual, however that is what makes it an appealing read.  There is no sweet coating and the story begins with an explosive bang.  With that in mind, if you don't enjoy gore, skip this one.I, truthfully, am not a huge fan of overt amounts of gore, however I was enthralled with the format and progression of Serial.  The ending was awesome and completely rocked.  The talent of Jack Kilborn and Blake Crouch combine to make an intense and entertaining short story/novella and one that I highly recommend to those fans of horror.  I greatly look forward to reading further works by both of these authors!",1
"Alexia Colten arrives in Jaffery's Cove to take care of her ailing grandmother.  It has been several years since she has visited the cove where she spent most of her summers as a youth.  When Alexia gets there she discovers things are not as they seem and her life is about to change forever.Jaffery's Cove is the home of merfolk, dolphin shifters.  Alexia is to become the new leader of the pod only she has no idea they exist or what the job entails.  Step one of becoming the matriarch of a merfolk pod find your consorts...plural.Joshua has been in love with Alexia since she started coming to the cove at the tender age of 14.  Joshua would do anything for Alexia and is determined to not become her consort but her permanent lover.  Unfortunately for him, so is every other unmated male in Jaffery's Cove.Anthony is Joshua's cousin, a docile teacher at the local school.  He has decided to leave the consorting to the other eligible bachelors.  Anthony changes his mind after he spends time with Alexia.  She awakens every protective and dominant bone in his body.Can Alexia accept her new role as the leader of the merfolk?  She is very confused by her feelings for the men around her.  She struggles with the fact that she believes her feelings are unacceptable.  Can she overcome her insecurities to become the leader she was born to be and discover a life that can fulfill her wildest dreams?Tidal Wave was a lust filled adventure from the beginning.  It had some very funny moments most featuring Alexia's wonderful Gram, I loved her!  Joshua, Alexia, and Anthony set the pages on fire with their intensity.  Alexia is a compelling heroine dealing with this amazing new world with grace.  Each character brought their own issues to the relationship and the relationship makes them better people.  When I read the shifters in this book were dolphins I was skeptical but my doubts were resolved immediately.  There was a romanticism surrounding the story that I absolutely adored.  There is even a bit of danger to satisfy those suspense taste buds.  Tidal Wave is a force of nature to be reckoned with.  I will definitely be sampling the second book of this series.MirandaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"A manual on desert island survival in its own right, this book besides having the old Verne slow build to a climax that I love so much has a LOT of interesting little asides that give a lot of information about attitudes and behaviour of the time, from the treatment of the the castaways towards each other, the land around them, and the animals.  Worth reading.",1
Wow!  This was a really good short story....I've never read anything from either of these authors so it looks like I've discovered a gold mine to dig in.....I can't wait to read more. Recommended.,1
I was entranced with the way this author brought together Margaret Atwood's &#34;Surfacing&#34; and shamanism. This book helped me to understand shamanism a little more and prompted me to add Surfacing to my reading list.,1
This is the first book I read by Deatri King Bey. I like the scenes between Saundra & her sisters. I thought it was cute how Saundra sister tried to hook her up. The storyline really didn't hold my interest & it was kinda corny. I don't know if I would read more books by this author.,0
"I have so enjoyed this book, reading it straight through, and savoring it still, weeks later!! I love our main character and her 'cat' and all the relationships and happenings.  Miranda is strong, determined, focused, and has interesting thoughts...  I knew who the cat was very early, but enjoyed the other surprises that crept up on us.  I was moved by the people, their thoughts, the situations that developed.  Good, enjoyable book!",1
This is truly a remarkable and gross story but I loved it.Hands down one of the best I've read in a long time.besides the other serial killers books.Taylor and Donaldson are fabulous together. the chills keep coming.,1
Holy Hot Guys Batman!! This book is definitely not for anyone under 18 or prudes it is Hot-Hot-Hot!!! Alexa meets Justin and then his brother Jason thinking they are one in the same. When something happens to her they both come to the rescue. One brother is an adrenalin junky that works on cars & the other is a businessman but both are hot as h-e-l-l!  I listened to the audio version and the narrator did a fantastic job!,1
"Short erotic read, would have liked to see how this worked out.  She's following him at the request of the wife, but you'll never guess how it ends up...wish there had been an epilogue to go with this.",1
"It did not have that build up that was needed.  This should have been listed in the Christian category.  It's not bad, but could possibly be true, but it just didn't do justice & didn't keep me interested.  Good thing the story was short.",0
no good for me but will probably be of use to someone with a different make of kindle.seller did reply,0
"Typical Alpha meets repressed human female, all the while fighting the attraction. This type of protagonist was a new twist, but the story was barely exciting.",0
"This was a fun read and a little different for Cascadia.  Where all of the other stories focus on the mated pair and the problems with the Pellini Group, this one seems to focus more on the family and the problems are ony between the mated pair.  While the Pellini Group are still there in the background, this story focuses on the chance meeting of a mated pair at a wedding.Unfortunately for our darling Megan, her destined mate has grown up being taught to hate and hide his inner wolf by a Mother who, while obviously  mated to a wolf herself, thinks that that part of them are nothing more than beasts.  She does a good one on him mentally and due to his Fathers love of his mate, he allowed it without saying anything until the damage was done.Thus begins the story of a sucessful Doctor, who lives as a human, and wants his mate to join him.  Megan, who is Second and Enforcer for Cascadia cant live away from her pack, wont live that way no matter how much she loves her mate.Will love overcome?  Will her mate learn to accept and love his wolf, or are they destined to live worlds apart and in pain for the remainder of their lives?  It is a story that has it all, and like all of the Cascadia Wolves stories, I would recommend each and every one of them!We need more Cascadia Wolves!!",1
"In a nutshell:I'm going to purchase the next book and see where it leads.I feel like the primary character needed to have a bit more age and experience... and perhaps a little more inertia to his intellect rather than just constantly winging it and winning against a clever antagonist.Felt kinda like ""I grew up in the outback, now I'm kicking butt""Maybe something bridging or providing background... (another novel?) that would kinda put some meat on the character?I guess I'm saying the character's 'awesomeness' was explained in a rather uninspiring fashion.The setting is fairly well done.  The background characters are likable, even the bad guys.  Characters behave in a way that is quite reasonable to their personality and interests (ie, bad guys *not* making stupid mistakes by supposed overconfidence, the crutch of bad storytelling).",1
"Sorry to say, I did not enjoy this book at all.  I thought the plot was bad, even to the point of being distasteful. Thankfully it was short.",0
"I wasn't familiar with James Somers but was very pleased with this book...it was nothing like I had read before....BUT IT, READ IT",1
I was disappointed I did not like it.  I did not like it.  Again I did not like it. period.,0
Didn't know it was short stories.  None of them were long enough to satisfy.  Whatever. I didn't get the sense of any of them.,0
"If I could give this story 3 1/2 stars instead of 3, I would have. This is basically a love story about a physically & mentally damaged guy who has pretty much stayed in the shadows due to his deformity. That doesn't stop him from getting what he wants - whether success in the financial world or his share of women. His main thing is not letting anyone close to him.Well...along comes Katie who has become an object of his desire and lust due to a self-portrait of her that he purchased from the coffee shop she works in. Of course she becomes his current challenge to get her into bed. However, he hasn't ever encountered someone like Katie - she meets him head on in his sexual whims and desires but she is also a pure loving soul who sees past his deformity. She's not out to get anything from him except his love. In the first half of the story, I was a little taken aback by how easily Katie fell into his sexual wishes so soon and sudden. Cain came across a bit like a stalker, lurking in the night - but it was understood that he preferred the darkness of the night so he could hide his deformity. He also came across as hot and cold and it was puzzling to Katie.Of course since he doesn't believe he is deserving of her love, he initially pushes her away with cruel and cold words. But credit has to be given to Katie - she didn't slink away or let his mean words push her away..initially. I kept thinking that if someone said those means things to me, I would have been gone in a flash. But because she didn't let his words push her away, he started to see the relationship in a different light. But of course his demons kept coming out and eventually it did accomplish in pushing her away.The second half of the story was simply a realization. It takes a true love to take you out of the darkness and into the light...but only if you can see it in yourself that you are worthy of being loved. Love isn't easy - when you find that love you have to hold on. And that's what Cain comes to realize in the end. The book started off with light BDSM and turned into a deeper story of love.",0
"This is a good book, and it keeps the reader in suspense, although it gets a little boring at times. 5 men get stranded on an island and they get into some adventures. Pretty standard plot, however there is an orangutan named Joop and a dog named Top, which gives the novel some heart and soul in addition to diversity. I felt cheated quite a bit by the ending, however I still enjoyed it.",0
"Gabby and Justin were roommates for 2 years, until 6 months ago when she moved out of his house while he was in Cabo w/ some of his buddies.  He runs into her a grocery store, she tries to hide from him - she had been avoiding him.  She moved out 2 weeks after they had drank a bottle of tequila and Justin kissed her.  So they made out - then she moved out - without a word, no note - nothing.  Justin is giving up that easy, he wants Gabby - and he will do anything to convince her.  There is talk of domestic violence but, it only to develop the background plot - doesn't really play into the main story line.This is another story about how a friendship becomes more.  However, what made this a story good was the balance of emotion and detail.  This story was very short - but has impact.",0
"The civil war books were excellent, well written and fun to read. The science fiction I'd dated in technology (seems to be almost pre computer and digital) but the story lines are interesting and well written.",1
I really shouldn't rate this book since I could only get through very little of it. How freaking boring!!! I just had to give up completely.,0
This book was great made me cry few times it is well writen and presented and lovely plot I could not put it down,1
"Prequel to the series, this is more short story than anything else. Funny how you can find a sweet story amid fire & brimstone.This does NOT need to be read in any order and stands on its own quite nicely. This is something of the set up for the rest of the books. In fact, you will probably enjoy it more if you already HAVE read some of the other books.The writing is thick with imagery and sensuality- as is Ms. Showalter's trademark. Don't look for depth- just desperation and passion. It is more of an experience than a story. It wraps around you like a smooth glass of port.In case you are not familiar with the series, you should know that this novella is actually a bit of a departure from the style of the rest of the books. This is one of my favorite series- hot, sensual, dark & dangerous. This story is more of an aside, like a fable within the Lords of the Underworld universe.",1
This is a book that's definitely not for the faint of heart. The concept was interesting and the sex beyond spicy with good writing and believable characters it really had it all. The progression of their relationship although highly sex based was still great to read and I definitely can't wait for the next one.,1
"John Carter was one of my first introductions to reading SCI-FI.  I enjoyed these books as a young man and then re-read them before the Disney Movie came out.  Yes, the movie was a train wreck, but the books are worth the read.  Don't base reading these books on the movie.  I recommend this series of books for younger readers.",1
"There is a magic mirror, a curse, a hot naked werewolf and a lonely woman living in an all wolf town. Even though I liked the bit of fairy tale magic in the mix I am not keeping only because the fact that the rest of the series is an average of $5 each. to me that is way too much for the average alpha were meets mate who thinks he is hotter than chocolate sin.",0
This is a story of a poacher named Belora who shoots a deer and meets a dragon and the knights that protect the land. Gareth and the other knight Lars take you into the beginning of the novella. After reading this story I can't wait to find out about the other characters in the story. As with the other books I have read from Bianca D'Arc she didn't let me down.,1
"On the whole, I liked the story. It makes sense, for the most part, and the characters are enjoyable. However, the editing is rather poor (hard to read at times), and I didn't like the love story's ending.",1
"I was excited to see that this book was free on Kindle and was going to read through it and then promote it to my following... but I was sorely disappointed. It looks as if the company wanted to gain exposure by publishing a book of their own, only they did a really poor job. The information contained in this book often contradicted itself. Instead of clearly setting forth book marketing tips, it basically listed a slew of marketing information that can be found easily on the internet. Most authors who have researched book marketing online know that that information doesn't always match up; e.g., Don't give your book away for free - tell people where they can buy it... A few pages later: Don't underestimate the power of free...? So which is it?Some of the marketing tactics listed were for cheating the system to raise your rankings. I didn't care for that at all. They also recommended a book via author, however never mentioned the title of the book... I'm sure I could search the authors name, but unless he has only written one book, I won't really know what book they were recommending - not that I would read something recommended in this book anyway.Finally, I can't leave a review without mention the formatting of this book. With the way they formatted it, it was hard to follow. The paragraphs seemed to just run together, which only added to the confusion of the information contained.",0
Had a hard time with this story.  Too much info that was repetitive.  Could have been shorter and conveyed the same story.,0
Have several different versions of the Bible in 'hard copy'. Nice to have one available on my Kindle for when I travel.,1
"Short, cutesy, and rote! It was over before you had a chance to 'know' the characters strenghts and weaknesses...Leanne, no more minis. This format does not do you justice, you are an amazing writer. Don't sell out!",0
Stephanie Bond writes funny romances that are easy to read.  This was a very funny enjoyable story.  I am now a Stephanie Bond reader.,1
I couldn't get into this book.  The dialouge is stilted and the author couldn't convince me to care about the characters.,0
I love the Wardens. I really do. but Shane was such a jerk! it was hard to like him at all. even the end!  it is a good read.  keep them coming!!,1
"I've read several of Tuttle's books now and have enjoyed all of them. This detective fantasy noir sort of thing is ok--dunno if it's for me.However, I'll buy a couple more to be sure!  Tuttle is worth supporting.",0
"Oh wow...I just read most of this straight through and I don't even know what to say.  I need to take a minute to collect my thoughts.  It was so beautiful and so well done.  And in such an original way too.  Of course I guessed a few things before they happened, but Part 1 was so different than Part 2 of the book, and I did not expect it to go in that direction at all.  I love how it went beyond the original premise to the recovery and all.  Part 2 of the book is where it became most original.  I also loved the half and half viewpoints, I loved the two leads (and I loved the layout of the book, how you learn each character truly in turn, and then can think back and know more of their emotions from earlier scenes).  And the story became harsh, it had me tearing up there for a while...but this book really had everything.  From the sex and action and denial, to the romance and passion, pain and change, love and hope, growth and future.  It was a brilliant work like all I've read by Josh Lanyon.  Now I'll check out Laura Baumbach too.  But I know this story will stay with me.  I loved it completely. Eventually I'll reread it knowing all that I do now and I think that will only make it better.P.S. See?  This review is still all scattered because this book just kind of out my brain on another level.  So wonderful.",1
"In 1806 when Mallory Edwards was seventeen and John Barron was a few years older, their parents arranged for their marriage.  They met on their wedding day for the first time; exchanged vows; and the next morning he left joining the army.Seven years later, Mallory is tossed from her home due no payment as her wandering husband's uncle stopped sending her allotment.  Fuming, Mallory comes to London to confront her husband and demand a divorce.  Not caring one iota for proper behavior, she rips his head off in front of his mistress.  When John realizes the screaming crone is his wife, he grabs her and leaves his mistress at home. Mallory proves he owns nothing as his fortune has been embezzled while he dallied.  Together they seek his missing relative who absconded with his money.  However, as they fall in love while hiding as commoners he realizes his wife is an intelligent beauty and no longer the little girl he married; she realizes her husband is an intelligent hunk and no longer the runaway boy she married.Readers will enjoy this 1997 Regency ""Treasure"" as the metamorphosis of the lead couple is deftly handled by Cathy Maxwell.  John is a selfish boor while Mallory lacks self esteem; each matures as he looks inside himself and dislikes what he sees and she begins to gain confidence.  Readers will enjoy this second chance at marriage as this time the protagonists fall in love.Harriet Klausner",1
Not a good book would not recommend it to anyone I have read other books by this author and I have enjoyed them.  This one is just not up to par,0
"I had known about Leale for awhile, but had never read his personal notes.  He was in Ford's Theatre when the President arrived, and he described both Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln's countenance as they were received.  For a moment, you begin to truly understand how Mr. Lincoln saw himself at the close of hostilities, having been worn thin by his service of the previous four years.  Personally, I saw Lincoln as tired, drained, relieved, and hopeful.  The man needed to rest before re-uniting the country &#34;with malice toward none and charity for all&#34;.  I also think this book accentuates the deep loss we endure to this day, by the actions of a single fanatic, armed with a pistol.I recommend this to anyone studying Lincoln, reconstruction, or the Civil War in general.  It's a quick, easy read, and certainly worthy of any high school history class or better.",1
"I'm trying to get into these freebies but they always say cheap isn't better. The book preview said it's not Ren's ever after but you have to read another book for that this book is just for the lose ends. As short as it is I didn't get into it I was not impressed. I do give the freebie books a chance because it gives me a chance to get to know new authors and see their style of work. This book was not for me it felt like a left over of something, I think most authors who gives us these freebie short novella should realize some books does not stand alone because without reading the series some readers would be lost, but then again that's how they introduce you to their work and series. I need to read a real good book quick because I feel like I'm in a funk or maybe I should give the freebies a break now.**********************************",0
"I recently discovered this author (or authors) and have fallen for their books! Based off of that I was a little disappointed in this story, not for the plot or storyline but because it was so short. I didn't know when I purchased it that it was a short story, so when it ended I was diappointed. I wish it would've been a full length book instead. Love it and all the other books!",0
what is up with the pricing.  i was considerig a subscription but a month of four issues is six bucks whereas a single issue is a buck.  what is wrong with this picture.  not to mention other reviewers comments re dead tree price including web access vs kindle price.  insane.,0
JR Ward please note Zadist is my favorite of all the Bothers. The next time he shows up in another novel it better be rated 5 stars,1
"Many of these stories seem unfinished.  They really weren't ghost stories either...just odd stories with a twist here and there.  As a lover of ghost stories, I was very disappointed.",0
"Not the deepest materiaI, but think this author is really taking off.  His Markhat series, while completely subsumed by Glen Cook's Garrett series, is different enough to generate real interest.  His supposedly youth-qualified &#34;All the Paths of Shadow&#34; is actually a tour de force (sans sex).  I look forward to more from Frank Tuttle.",1
Didn't like it at all. I have no problem with dominance but I have no time for rape for real.,0
"I read this short story because of its authors. Both are great authors and the story had potential. Unfortunately, while a good read, it doesn't live up to its full potential.A driver picks up a hitchhiker. Kills him. A hitchhiker is picked up by two stoners and kills them. Third chapter: The serial killers meet and all hell breaks loose.Except that hell is a little bit predictable. But graphic.I had to read the story twice. I didn't read the description or advance marketing copy before beginning the story so I was not prepared for the POV shift in the second chapter. It confused me until I went back and read it again. The cliffhanger from the first chapter appears to lead in to the second chapter quite naturally, but the POV shift was a shocker until I understood how the authors collaborated and who wrote each part. After that, the story made better sense. That's probably my fault for not reading the promos.Still, the writing is not completely terse. There are parts of it that can be tightened. Adverbs where none are necessary. Sentences that could have been shorter. But these are nitpicks. The plot and story line are actually decently implemented.The problem is the authors could have spent a little more time on the collaborative effort in chapter three to make it more unpredictable. Some of the characterization is a little flat even for a short story. Otherwise, I'd say it was a decent read.Doesn't quite deserve four stars, but it's better than three stars. Probably more like a 3.8.",1
"9 books in the series and the next one is better than the last. Doesn't disappoint. LOVE every book, great series. MUST read! Hot Hot Hot!",1
This was just ok for me. I never really connected with the story. At times I felt like I was struggling just to finish . Wish that there was more explanation of their world. Unfortunately this wasn't for me.,0
"I enjoy these types of books and this one was right up there with the best.  A very good read.  Thanx to the author, job well done!",1
"Great story of lust and love. Surrounded by deception. Many shifters, main characters are owl shifters. Nice birds eye view on shifters (pun intended). Almost finished and loving every minute of this book.",1
I have all of these books in the first set of Westmoreland stories on hardback but wanted them also on my tablet.  It is easie to store on the tablet even though I am collecting all of her books on hardback.  Great read for those of you that have never read a Brenda Jackson book.,1
"This book has some homosexual content so if you are not into that type of read this book is not for you.  I was not offended by it but probably would not have purchased the book if the guy on guy content had been in the disclaimer.  Otherwise, the book was steamy and had some very erotic elements.",0
Justin and Amy make quite a pair.  The sex is hot and the love is sweet.  He understands her and loves all of her.  Once Amy lets go she loves Justin right back.,1
"This was overall a sweet story, a story about finding love again after losing your first love.  There is not a lot of plot going or character development.  Story was fairly short, I finished it in a sitting.  This is the story of Sophia and Ethan.  Sophia was married to Dan for over 20 years and Dan died two years ago.  Ever since his death, Ethan, Dan's best friend and business partner becomes close to Sophia and her daughter. He is secretly lusting and loving Sophia but is afraid of telling her.  She has become close to Ethan over the last few months.  She would have been lost if not for his friendship and support.Typical story of man that has always felt something special for his best friend's wife but never got too close until after his friend dies and is time for Sophia to move on. Sophia was scared of things she was feeling for her husband's best friend.  She needed to escape and decides to go on a cruise by herself to clear her head and be away.  Turns out Ethan wouldn't let her go without him and shows up at the ship surprising her.You can probably guess the ending from there on.  Nice to see a more mature couple finding love again, especially for someone who loses their husband of 20+ years.",0
Wow to be loved by 2 handsome men! If you like handsome men with ripped bodies this is the story for you.,1
"Normally, I wouldn't read these kind of book anymore.  Not as much enjoyment, and I don't need much more of this kind of education. Okay, so this is just me.  It's a good book for learning what went on back in those days.  Try ut, you may like it!Lou",0
"This could have been a good book if the plot had been developed more in my opinion.  The profanity that was littered here and there seemed so unnatural and unnecessary and could have been omitted.  It would have held my attention more.  For much of it, I wondered when it would end.  The author seemed more interested in describing the sex act than developing the characters.  Sorry, not my cup of tea.",0
"This is a pretty good story,has a little of everything going on and keeps you reading.  I read it in less than a day and enjoyed it!!",1
When the book started I wasn't so sure that I wanted to read anything about the main character presented. But as the story progressed I found myself interested in him more and more.,1
this short story has a great plot. its written by two authors simultaneously really impressed me. When two serial killers meet up what do u think will happen? will they team up and become the dynamic duo or take each other out.,1
"This book lelt me wanting more. The sexual tension in this office could make a virgin come on demand. Good thing all work places aren't like this,",1
"I've read longer works by Ms. James, and found them unmemorable.  Novels take more skill than might appear--developing characters the reader can like or dislike, or in some way find interesting enough to continue turning the page. As I recall, she doesn't particularly excell in the long form. I gave this work a try, hopinng Eloisa James's forte might be in the shorter work.  While it is difficult to develop characters much in the time and space contraints of the novella, one would hope for interesting characters, at least.  Ms. James has fallen to the temptation of crafting paper doll characters: all rather shallow and incredible extremes.  The husband is rough and evil, but not entirely so.  His successor is suave and courteous, but not particularly so.  The protagonist (there are actually two and a half) is a man who apparently has grown and changed very little from boy to man, yet we are supposed to root for him.  The heroine has changed not at all from girl to wife to widow.  She is simply confused and lustful.  Sorry to 'spoil' the plot for you, but read it yourself and see if you find it any more satisfying.",0
"This is the sixth book I've bought from this author, and I enjoyed all the others, including the first novel in this series.  This book, however, was a waste of money.  It lacked dramatic tension, sexual tension, or anything else that would make it worth reading.  I finished it only out of a sense of disbelief that she could write something so terrible.  Save your money and precious time - avoid this book.",0
"The Economist is an excellent magazine for anyone who is interested in not only the US economy, but the global economy.  I find all the articles to be well written and not one sided like many other magazines.  I find that a great deal of research has been done to write engaging articles that don't put me to sleep.By no means am I in finance; however, I enjoy keeping abreast with world news.Previously, I've subscribed to the print version, and now I have subscribed to the Kindle edition. I probably won't subscribe to it online for long. I agree it is quite expensive online.  The print version is approximately $1.00 per issue when specials are offered. Without a special it is maybe $150.00 a year for the print edition.I really like the Kindle edition, and for a lower price, I would not be opposed to having advertisements in the Kindle edition. I can just glance at them and keep on reading just as I do in the print version.",1
"This book is so funny that you have to be sitting down, without food or drinks, while you're reading it.  There were so many silly, incredibly ridiculously funny moments in this book.  Please read this one, it's so good.  I don't know how Bond does it, the book is so sexy and romantic but she manages to make the characters so funny and loveable.",1
"This story has a lot of history of India.  An Indian doctor is practicing in a small English town.  His mother is married to an Englishman.  He meets his English rose and the plot picks up.  His standards are very high and he practices great control until they marry.  She is a little ""damaged"" by past events in her family but he gets her through all of that.  It is a good story line but I got a little tired of all the negative events and their inability to do anything about it but sit and wait for everyone to become enlightened and see how wonderful they truly are.  It was an interesting read for the most part but I found a lot of the characters a little hard to believe.  So many bad guys in one family!!",0
"I had a hard time with this one.  So you have a 35 year old female virgin, Savannah.  You have an alpha male, Matt, who is dominant sexually and who has been in love with Savannah.  Matt feels Savannah is in love with him too and wants him but has been repressed and damaged by her father.  So, what better way to get her to admit her feelings and relinquish control to Matt for him to love and care for her then binding her, hanging her from the ceiling videotaping it and letting each one of his business partners (four other men) have a go at her.  Oh, but there are rules...they can't penetrate her.  How generous of Matt.  One gives her oral sex, the other a device that penetrates her vaginally and anally), the other her breasts and the last her backside.  Each gives her gifts too, you know, because they care and love her.  She gets a sexual device, nipple clamps, pearls (that need to be cleaned because they were inserted into her rear!!) and a diamond engagement ring.  SERIOUSLY?!  Back to Savannah...she has never had sex (oral, vaginal, anal)let alone any BDSM.  They do this to her and at times in the book she says she wants to say no but she can't get the words out as if she is paralyzed.  She does so ""no"" and they still continue at one point.  So, just because her body is responding and they are the experts it is determined that she really doesn't mean ""no.""  Also, Matt is digging his fingernails into his hand and turning away at times when he allows these other men to do this to her.  At the ends he admits he it was too much and he wanted to stop it.  But, he doesn't.  It is not rape but what I got from it is that she was soo paralyzed by fear and the novelty and intensity of these sexual experiences, as her need to not fail at anything (including giving into Matt with this) that she was not in the right state of mind to make and VERBALIZE appropriate decisions.  Again, at times she did say ""no"" and ""I can't take anymore.""  Savannah didn't have a relationship with Matt that he could adequately judge her wants and needs and what was best for her.  This was a little disturbing.",0
"Second Hawke series we are reading, only three quarters of the way through but just have to rate in anyway.... Love it..Looking forward to reading the other two we have loaded in the Kindle...Our first read was &#34;Ride with the devil&#34; and this one is just as good.... Keep up the good work Robert Vaughan...",1
"The author has real writing ability; I can't stress this strongly enough.  She has what they call: ""Turn of phrase.""  But the running internal monologue of Maud, the main character, got old after the first half.On the positive side, I liked all the characters, and lots of the vignettes were believable when thinking about small-town life.  But a bunch of vignettes strung together didn't make a workable book for me.  The theme of The Muse lost and The Muse found wasn't strong enough to carry the book.I would be very interested in reading other work by this author, whose talent is not in question.",0
the reviews i read weren't exactly wrong... the end she does seem to kinda give up but there's supposed to be a second book coming out and after everything she goes through i'd be like yeah anything to just get a good nights sleep... this book was awesome... she did a great job introducing you to a whole other world full of different races of creatures and devils and gods... without wasting time explaining about it... she wrote it in a way that you just understood what was going on... i loved it... the only thing is if you've read other books by her then you might have noticed she sure doesn't mind having her main character have the crap beat out of them and some dirty junk happen... i think this story was good... i've loved all her books so far... and no matter what it was definitely worth a dollar...,1
This was the first piece I read by Jon Merz that was not part of the Lawson series. It was an excellent choice and will appear on my list of favorite novels read in 2011.So far it is my favorite novel by Jon.,1
I'm a slow reader because I only get to read during my break ... the characters were beleaveable and the story had me looking forwards till my next break to read more... Can not wait to buy Wings in the Night Part 2 and if it ever comes out as a movie I'd love to see it :)All of Maggies's books in my collection are awesome loved every one of them.,1
"The interaction with the protagonist and his ex-wife is simply too drawn out.Te ex-brother-in-law is initially presented as a sort of like-able guy, and turns into a lunatic. Very unrealistic.The whole drug and violence scenes are so tedious, I found myself skipping most of those.If those would have been shorter, the story would have been a lot more enjoyable to read.And the ending was sooooo predictable!",0
I wish it was more. It left me high and dry. I was yearning for more and a better ending.,0
It started promising but it turned way too cheesy right down the middle. Perhaps more info on the paranormal creatures????,0
"Parts of the set-up here were really interesting.  They were even more interesting when they were on BBC's Merlin.  I mean, you kept the slash dragon.  Really?  King Ungor?  If you're going to file the serial numbers off your fanfic, file a little harder.",0
I have read three of his books and found them all very good.  Interesting and full of action.  I will most likely read others by him.,1
"This is one of my least-favorite books by Harrington. It wasn't bad--even Harrington's 'bad' would be better that most authors' 'good'--but A Light For My Love didn't grab me and hold my attention the way her other stories have. I suspected it was one of her earlier works, and I was right. Still, Homeward Hearts, released before this, was quite good.The writing is professional and rich, and the characters are well drawn. The problem I had with A Light For My Love was the fact that the plot seemed to drag in places and the heroine was irritating at times. I got as frustrated with her as did Jake.There is also a scene in which the heroine has information about something, but chooses to wait and look at a confirming characteristic at a later time. (Sorry. I know that's vague...trying not to be a spoiler.) I didn't buy it. In her place, I would have looked at it as quickly as I could. The author should have had Jake leave out that piece of information and then have China discover it later, on her own. The detail in question would have been self-explanatory, and it would have ramped up the emotion in one of the final scenes.Bottom line, this story is in need of some tweaks and a good trim. It wasn't a bad book; I did finish it and I mostly liked it. But if this is your first sample of Alexis Harrington, you should pick something else and try her work again. 3 1/2 stars.",0
I like it because it gives a more accurate translation of certain words than the King James.  I would recommend it.,1
"I fear that most of this needs to stay lost - I love Heinlein from this era, and Asimov a bit less but too much of this material deserves being forgotten for a bit longer.",0
"This one was not as good as all her others, but I still enjoyed the read.  It's one of 3 (I believe)  starring the same group of people.I thought it was sad that Tony spent all that time pining for Constance and she didn't remember who he was.  I think anyone who likes regency romance or books by her will enjoy this one.  Money well spent.",1
"For years, vampire Raphael Laurent has watched Lord Aleric Vane from afar.  Aleric is the third son of a duke and his unwillingness to give into his father's demands has left him without funds, but with the freedom to do as he pleases.  Raphael keeps watch over the object of his desires, but never makes contact until Aleric is attacked.  The attackers leave Aleric near death, so Raphael rescues him the only way he can - by turning him.  But turning Aleric into a vampire only creates problems instead of solving them.  For to save Aleric, Raphael broke an unwritten rule.  One that may cost him the one chance he has at an immortal life with the man he loves.From Afar starts off on a high note with a tempting mix of longing, action, and vice.  Unfortunately, while Ava March hooked me at the start, my attention was lost less than halfway through the story.  From Afar is disappointingly unmemorable.  Raphael and Aleric were likeable and the sexual tension between them was laid out on the page, both basic elements of an intriguing tale.  Yet nothing in this story came to life for me, which was a pity.  Don't get me wrong - there is nothing to dislike about From Afar.  The ingredients for an entertaining story are all present and Ms. March's writing flowed smoothly, so perhaps even though From Afar didn't capture my attention, it will grab someone else.ShaynaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",0
Author made a serious error by referring to these notable women by their first names in the major portion of the book. I finally made a list of their full names to keep track. It was distracting. Be forewarned. Lot of research went into this book. The editor should have helped the author.,0
"I have to give the story four stars just because the ending was so terrible.  It builds you up and drops you like a bomb and then you see the words ...... the end.......and are like, seriously?  Otherwise this story is well written and very intense and great.  There is compassion between the characters that can't be matched in many books.  It has you rooting for the main  character to over come his hurdles and obstacles, but like I said the ending is a bummer.",1
"Lorna and James are both doctors and also exs.  James has tried to find her after 10 yrs. of separation.  An emergency has the hospital in rushing mode.  A multiple vehile accident has them in high gear.There is one last transport to the hospital by ambulance, that was a distance from the scene of the accident.  Right away James is shocked by the patients ""Toe Nails -(pink)"".  This is Lorna - his ex.Lorna happened to be driving to a job interview, when she was caught up in the vehicle pile-up.  She is in poor shape when she is brought in, but of course pulls through.As the hospital is so short staffed at the time she ends up filling in an application and being on staff at Jame's hospital.  She also is staying at his apt. to recoupurate.  Happy ending as usual.",1
"Great place to go if you need a break from everyday life. , too.If you like These, try the Tarzan's as well. You may be surprised haow much of an adult read they really are, though I read them as a young teen, as well.",1
"I enjoyed the storyline but it left too many questions unanswered for me to give it a good rating.  The reason I didn't give it a better rating was because the story could have been much better if the author concentrated on answering the questions about his wife and best friend's murders.  The story while enjoyable did not follow what the plot started off as but instead dwelled too much on the antics of Nicky. Jared wants revenge against Ricard so when he finds out the true story, the reader is then left with a big &#34;Why&#34; was she killed in the first place.in a way, I think the author forgot what her plot really was.  She had too many sub-plots instead of developing the main plot which was the murder revenge.",0
"From an allegedly true Irish story Summoning falls into the general horror and/or mystery genre of young adult texts, but somehow seems to fall short.  The one redeeming feature of the book is that the descriptions, particularly of the dissonance between the senses, and inner conflicts when dealing with demons which help to create a darker, more suffocating mood.  The characters, however are merely sketched, and this is not helped by the leaps forward and back through time.  Though the time jumping does not hinder the telling of the story, it puts a barrier between the text and the reader which makes identifying with Meredith's plight difficult to do.  This also makes the abrupt ending hard to accept.  All of a sudden we, as readers, go from Meredith's 15th year, to her 30th, and suddenly everything is resolved in an 'almost-happy-ever-after'",0
Amazon needs to take a page from their offerings on other magazines before the ocean of negative reviews will reverse its course. You receive no digital access at a higher price. Not a winning formula and an epic fail on customer experience. This is surprising since Amazon leads the way on customer service in so many other areas. I am hopeful they will remedy this  soon.,0
You can read the excerpt to get the story..but this was a real written book. A sweetlove story with plenty of heat!! A cowboy and a hero all in one!! You will not be disappointed!,1
It wasnt the typical kind of romance (where the two people fall in love and get so super mushy) so I thought it was very refreshing.,1
"This story is typed very similar to a cable TV show called Dead Like Me"" with a little variation so as not to be a rip off of the show.  I don't watch TV for last 4/5 years - but I remember seeing a few episodes of that late night 4 am.The issue I have with the book is NOT the F bomb usage.  It is the fact that the characters all have the same or similar enough ""voice"" that there is no variety of substance.  If there were not names on chapters to establish POV - the Linda character and the Mike character sound almost identical.A few of Linda's pranks were cute - but not enough fleshing out of characters or development of story arc to make the one or two chuckles worth the time spent reading this.Christine",0
Not what I thought it was going to be.  The stories were not that good. This was a disappointing purchase. Sorry.,0
"First book I've read from Vivian Arend and oh my, did she ever draw me in and hold me there! I hadn't planned on reading the entire book in one sitting but the way she captured my attention and held onto it was wonderful. I can't wait to read the next one!",1
Wild is an understatement.  Another great book from DD!  If your not already a fan - get ready to become one.,1
"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesAbby Brooks was expecting a relaxing few days while borrowing her best friend Kaitlyn's home but that's not what she gets. First she thinks she sees a large dog streaking through the snow-covered yard. Then, she can't find the spare key where it is supposed to be, so has to break in. Then upon entering the house she is attacked and accused of being a burglar. It sure doesn't help matters any that the man holding her is the most gorgeous man she has ever seen!Gabriel Hawthorne is at Kaitlyn's house installing a security system when he captures an intruder. He is surprised when she turns the tables and attacks him, saying he's the interloper. Even more surprising is the fact his wolf discovers the little spitfire is his mate! She is human though and Gabriel does not like or trust humans. How can she be his mate? As the two are snowed in together, passion burns bright and the wolf learns Perception is everything.Perception may take place during winter, but the heat Gabriel and Abby generate is enough to melt even the deepest of snow! Passion is fast, hot, and bright once the sparks between our lovebirds start flying. Gabriel is all alpha male, his wolf nature coming out, hard as a rock if he has to be yet willing to do anything to make Abby his, even in spite of his doubts about a relationship with a human. The sexual tension between them skyrockets, and when they come together, look out!Abby has a history but has made concerted effort to overcome her past and make a good respectable life for herself. Gabriel has no love for humans after the one he was closest to turned her back on him years ago so he swore never to get involved with a human again. Upon meeting Abby, his whole outlook on life begins to change and he realizes that there are humans in the world worth knowing and loving.Don't let the short length of Perception fool you. Patrice Michelle packs so much emotion into this story that you'll be wrung out by the end. She does a fantastic job of bringing her characters and their world to life so that we see them as real people, not just characters on a page. I have adored each and every installment in the Scions series and I can only hope that we will have plenty of opportunities to spend more time in this world. Kelley A. Hartsell, December 2008.

"Warning: This review contains spoilers. I just finished this book. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a Christian conservative. As such, I have a particular bias against books and works of fiction that attack Christians and conservatives. The author basically boils down the cause of all ills leading to his fictional civil war as non-catholic Christian social conservatives. He presents the premise that because Christian evangelicals refused to sit down, shut up, and let the slaughter of innocence continue, it caused a civil war. Because this same group refused to condone gay marriage, it caused a civil war. Because conservatives refused to allow the Federal government to grow into the single authority in the country, it caused a civil war. He lays all the blame for societies ills at the feet of those who believe in living their lives according to God's word, who also believe that the constitution and the Bill of Rights should apply to the Federal Government. The narrator, due to his many years of reflection, comes to understand that the beliefs he once held, contributed to the war. A reformed Christian and Conservative...who better to tell the story, right?I will say that the story is well written, in that it flows well. How the narrator came to be telling his story is an interesting premise. Beyond that, it's really a waste of time. At least it's cheap entertainment.",0
"Celia Evans wants it all.  She wanted the great love, passion, and excitement.  She almost had it all in Parker West, but he was predictable, boring, and proposed to her in a most unromantic way.  Celia was not selfish, but she refused to settle for less than everything, so she turned down the unacceptable proposal.  When Parker showed up at her front door, tied her up, and carried her off to an unknown location, she was frightened, but yet excited by his spontaneity.Parker was risking everything on this last chance effort.  He had known the difficult Celia all his life, and being a kind gentleman had gotten him nowhere, so he hoped unleashing his darker dominant side might penetrate her steel defenses.  When they arrived at his cabin, she responded to this side of him better than he could have ever anticipated.  If he would have known this was all it took, he would have introduced this aspect of his sexuality years ago.  His next proposal, although done while both of them were naked and in bed, was readily accepted.When neighbor Rance Colter tried to stop the quickie wedding in town, Parker knew it was only a sign of things to come.  He knew that Rance had wanted to claim Celia for his own, but she had never wanted him in return.  Now that Celia was his, Parker set up extra protection at his ranch as well as Celia's.  He didn't put anything past Colter, and knew he would try something soon.  Her being married would not stop him.  That is one thing Parker had no doubt about.  When Celia was abducted from home, both families swore she would be returned unharmed whatever the cost.A traditional formula that works well with this story.  Parker and Celia are a very explosive pair.  They do nothing half way whether it is fighting or lovin!  The erotic scenes are combustible.",1
With my indian background I liked this book and purchased a copy for my sister.  Liked the book a lot.,1
"The premise for this story was very intriguing and had it been written better, it has the potential of being a best-seller. But as it stands, it needs much work. For one, I'm from the Natchitoches, La. area and from the first chapter I could tell the author had never even visited Natchitoches.The author needed much more research to make this title accurate in details. There were some places that just made me plain mad.It was like the author looked Natchitoches up on Wikipedia and used it for accurate research. It was certainly missing authenticity.",0
"completely left me hanging,!!!!! was getting so good until it abruptly stopped and told me to but something else...wtf???!!! not happy",0
"From the first word, book did not hold my interest, causing me to skip ahead.  It only got worse.  I got the book as free ebook..I guess you get what you pay for.",0
This book was all over the place. Good thing it was  free. I do NOT recommend this book. I will not be reading two or three!,0
"This is not great literature. There were grammatical errors that I thought were really errors, but some of the weird sentences seemed to be the author's attempt to talk like a Texan. Or maybe not.I actually liked the characters. The names didn't bother me. (My new son-in-law is a Bubba.) And I laughed at the humor. I really thought it was funny. I liked the storyline, for the most part.But the reason I'm giving it one star is the profanity. If profanity bothers you, you will hate this book. Some of the bad language is not bad at all, and in fact adds to the humor, but when the author gets profane, he/she really gets profane. So be forewarned.",0
This book had a really messed up female character. I think she needed therapy!  Ha! It was a quick read,0
"very well done and really easy to use on the kindle. saved a good bit of money by getting it from amazon on the kindle, would have needed two books otherwise.",1
"A completely different book about magic, five-toed cats and a wife's quest for her missing husband.  A lighthouse keeper, away on a secret mission for the governor goes missing. Armed only with her husband's unusually descriptive letters, a stowaway orange cat and her fierce love for her husband, this determined provincial wife travels to an unfamiliar city to  hunt for her love.  A different kind of an adventure, where the magic is subtle, and not believing in it could be the difference between life and death. I thoroughly enjoyed this surprising book and highly recommend it!",1
This book started a little slow. I just wished it did not have to end.I wanted to know what happened to the cousin and the two guards.,1
"This story, from &#34;20th Century ghosts&#34;, is a page-turner with a very satisfying conclusion.  I congratulate Joe for having separated his collection into smaller, bite-size pieces which can be consumed in a short period of time.

"This was a fun and quick read.  I enjoyed the storyline and characters very much.  I wish it was longer because I would have loved to have read more about these two.  But, sometimes we just don't have a lot of free time in the day.  So, this was a great book to read in one sitting.",1
"First off I LOVE CRYSTAL JORDAN!- Great new series - Book 1 - This story is about Aubrey a coffee shop owner who is given a warning from a local homeless guy Jerrico to beware of fire. After his perdiction her business goes up in a fire. He then makes another prediction that she will meet her ""soulmate"". Aubrey not thinking of love after a bad divorce ignores his prediction again. But when police chief Price Delacroix comes to the shop to look at the fire damage she goes up in flames as well. This is a great angel on your shoulder love story with lots of hot scenes.",1
"it was a quick read and did not have enough depth. liked the idea of some f the punishments, but it was rushed. and some arts were confusing. I should retread a section of a story for one reason only, it was hot and had to read it again because... wow! um, read some lines again because it was kind of confusing. but like I said, liked the idea though. will read their work again, I liked their writing style, next time more to the story. that magic stuff was unneeded fluff or nt fluff enough.",0
"I'm not sure what I expected, but was not too impressed with this one. Pretty bland and uninteresting. Hoped for more.",0
i picked this novella up for free.  really enjoyed it.  going to look for more of this author's work. loved the characters and the fast pace of the story.,1
"Oh my goddess! This is something else.  This author must have smoked something I never tried ;).  I never read something so intense, so powerful.  I am a French speaking person and I was more into the dictionary than the book itself.  But I loved it, it expend my vocabulary to the max.  Naturally, as a French speaking person, I sometime found it confusing; was it the language barrier or was it really difficult to follow.  So, I was glad when I read some reviewers saying it was confusing and all over the place for them too.  But I still appreciate this book tremendously.The book cover is very representative to the storyline.  This story has strong characters who bring interesting plots to the storylines with issues such as homelessness, sexual abuse, rape, torture, special abilities and paranormal; a story that is so unpredictable.This is a book/storyline where you need and open mind, this is not an easy read.  You need to go back few pages in order to catch the idea, the meaning of what you just read.  Even if the storyline is about Jesse and Sarah who are about 17 years old, this is adult material.  Is this reality or hallucination?  Is this reality or parallel planes?  I really enjoyed this book and I would tremendously enjoy a sequel.I just downloaded &#8220;Corvus&#8221; of the same author.  I hope it will bring me as much pleasure as Mortal Ghost did.",1
"Oh, Thomas hooked me almost from the start! I mean, seriously, gaydar and pink toenails!?! Classic scene! I adore a man who will defend against bullies and the fact that Thomas used humor to run them away was fantastic! It just solidified for me how much I was going to enjoy this third book in the Tri-Omega Mates series.Thomas has headed away from the small Wolfrik pack for vacation on his motorcycle to see the sights of America. A stop in a small town leads him to Micah, his mate. I adored Micah from the beginning because of his sense of humor, his spitfire attitude, and his sheer emotional vulnerability. He has an inner strength that just radiates from him. Micah doesn't understand how he can seemingly accept all of the shape shifting information with little or no doubt and he's starting to think maybe he's crazy and then&#8230;Along comes Caleb, Alpha of the Hunter pack, called in by Jake, Thomas's Alpha, for a cleanup of some rednecks who thought Thomas and Micah would be easy game. Yeah, not so easy - Thomas wiped the floor with them. Caleb takes one look at Micah, bites and claims him, and now there's a whole lot of confusion going on. Is Micah human or a Tri-Omega? Can Caleb and Thomas share? Does Micah even want any part of this crazy life? Will Caleb's pack accept them?This was probably my favorite story, so far, in the whole series. These three men were smoking hot together and I adored their personalities and individual attitudes. So, if you like shifters, strong and dominant men, sarcastic attitudes, and very funny humor, then this story is for you!",1
"This story was a great idea. I started it and was interested in how the author would work out the communication between a werewolf and a deaf human. I didn't get much out of it, to be honest. I got into it, was enjoying myself very much reading, and then the main characters met (a ""helpless"" woman meeting two huge strangers in the middle of nowhere at night) and they got cuddly that very first night. Really? And the very next morning, they reveal that not only are they werewolves, she is one too! And she thinks it's really cool. Okay, fine, I can admit that if someone told me I was a werewolf, I'd be ecstatic.But then they can't have sex. Then they HAVE to have sex. Then they're in mortal danger, and in a blink all of a sudden the helpless deaf former-human is ordering around a pack hell bent on tearing them apart. What? And all this in how many words? This could have been stretched out and developed into an amazing full-length novel. It just seems all too neat in the end. Everything that was such a huge obstacle just magically turned out to be nothing but a speed bump and the heroine just wakes up one day, her world turned upside down and she's all peachy, going along with the program like it's the most natural thing. Yeah, I don't think so.Oh and the deaf thing? Wouldn't you know it? They can speak telepathically! Isn't that convenient?",0
"Maybe it isn't fair to start a review by complaining of the excessive length of this fascinating story.  But even Red Adept in her review highlights that problem right at the start.  And, to be fair. from about 60% of the way through the book I kept wondering when it would ever end.  So the extreme and unnecessary length was a key factor in my reading this book.Now, to be clear, I love long novels.  My favorite book (Tai-Pan by James Clavell) is over 700 pages.  This book I would estimate at about 650 pages (it is 14800+ locations on the Kindle).  And I continually read long books, but mostly in historical fiction- NOT action/adventure.  Those books are usually about 350-450 pages, which would have been the right length for this book.  Only Tom Clancy writes such long action thrillers (like Debt of Honor), but even those books are too long, and he is a best selling author- not a new writer.  So this book needed substantial trimming- I'd reduce it by at least 25% and probably closer to 35%.  There are only so many times you need to read about the characters escaping from the villains.Now, having complained about the length, I will state that the plot was terrific- Mozart in the 21st century, escaping death in the 1790's by the modern day evil company's time machine that brought him to today.  And, then, with his love interest Elisse, trying to escape from their clutches.  I would have preferred more about his music, but the portrayal of Mozart was quite fun.  It is very evident to me that the author based his characterization on Tom Hulce's performance in the movie ""Amadeus"".  (Note that in the book the movie is mentioned several times- so this connection is no accident).I must mention one fantastic scene where Mozart gets into a fiddle contest against Rainman in a honky tonk bar in New Orleans- Mozart plays his Stradivarius.  A real hoot!The time travel aspects, and the back story of the evil company and its device and manipulations are never revealed much- and that is OK.  The emphasis is on Mozart and his escape from his imprisonment.In short, I liked the book,and the premise very much- but the  book was much too long.  A major trimming would have helped enormously. (I downgraded it one star for the length.)A final word on the Kindle formatting.  I did not find it as troubling as the previous reviewers.  There were some errors, but not that many.",0
"While there are some spelling/grammar issues and the dialogue is somewhat clunky and unrealistic at times, the story is fairly unique.  At first I thought it was going to be the same old zombie story, but it has an interesting twist that I found surprising and refreshing.",0
This was a great book. It started off quick with a bit of a twist I didn't expect and then it kept me entertained the entire time. I loved the message of salvation in it. Jonathan  faith was an amazing message that I really enjoyed,1
"This prequel was not what I expected.  It was far to short, told nothing about Betsy's pre-undead life, and was simply frustrating.  Even free would be too much for this book.I would not recommend it to anyone!",0

I am a mystery/thriller fan and I am very happy to see this magazine offered for the Kindle.I live in Bermuda and this magazine is not available for sale here.Most magazines that are for sale here are double even triple the US list price.

"This is an interesting story about the mystery surrounding who will inherit Castlegate Manor.  There is a scheming cousin with pockets to let, a mother trying to marry-off her daughter without losing their station, a daughter trying marry her love and avoid marriage to said icky cousin, a beautiful young woman masquerading as a lady but without the proper pedigree, and a protective groom that seems more than a mere servant.  All the characters play an integral part in discovering the secret and unraveling the mysteries of the Manor.  Even a dead great-aunt influences the action as the story unfolds.I like the chemistry between the Hero and heroine.  It is a chaste relationship but the sensual tension is there; you can sense these two are drawn to each other and are fighting to keep their hands to themselves.  I also like that the h is as nice as she is smart and truly regrets any subterfuge she feels compelled to enact.  She is pragmatic and realistic but yet still has dreams of 'what could be' in her life.  The H is terribly masculine and a leader from the outset in spite of his lowly position in the stables.  The reader can guess fairly early who the groom likely is but figuring out the penultimate mystery keeps one turning pages.  The villain is truly nasty so it's easy to root for his comeuppance and there is plenty of tension and suspense as the action resolves over the last chapters.Without giving anything away, I feel some readers will say it is pure fairytale how the author deals with the disparity between the classes in her story.  History records several instances of courtesans and actresses marrying into the peerage, but the circumstances in this book make overcoming societal constraints highly unlikely.  In this story the servant is known in London and the peer is not high-ranking enough to pull off ""ignoring what anyone may say,"" especially as the resolution of the mystery would lead to much speculation in the Ton and most likely publication in the papers.  There would be no way to hide who married whom and what rank they were prior to the marriage. As a firm believer in the concept of true love and the adage that love conquers all, however, I do see these two characters marrying anyway and weathering the storm, retiring happily to the country to live their private lives.  I say disregard the fantasy of the match and just smile over the hard-won HEA.This was a sneaky little charmer of a book.  The writing style was clean and concise and the author kept the pace moving steadily throughout the book.  The secret was not terribly hard to figure out, but it was still worth reading to the end to see how the story would play out.  This was a nice, clean, light read for a Sunday afternoon.",1
"Book 5 of Bell's ""Halle Pumas"" series. Preceded bySteel Beauty. No further books at this time.Books 4 and 5 are available as a paperback anthologyAnimal Attraction.Plot:Now that Gabe has returned to town, Sarah needs to decide if she can trust him enough to give him her HEA.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting) SmallTown romance with explicit bedroom scenes.- 2272 kindle locations, 30,000 words, but finishes around 1940 locations.- m/f - explicit, reasonably frequent. Light bdsm including D/s, bondage, spanking.- Sarah has made cameo appearances in previous books. Gabe has also played roles as the town Sheriff and Adrian's Second. Events that occurred in Book 3, during Sheri's troubles, are referenced and affect The Senate's choice of Gabe as a Hunter.- ""Only in my Dreams"" starts within days of the destruction of the rogue wolves in Book 3.- Includes excerpts fromCabin Feverby Alisha Rai,Dance on the Wilde Sideby Beverly Rae, andVery Much Aliveby Dana Marie Bell.Opinion:I didn't like this story as much as I have the others in the series. It is pretty much all relationship-driven as Gabe tries to work out what he did wrong, and Sarah tries to forgive him. But too much of it just didn't gel for me, from Sarah being really, really hurt, and then rapidly forgiving him, to her inability or unwillingness to use her Super Senses to just work out what the heck is going on!!! And there seemed to be a big chunk of the book missing while Gabe went off to learn to be a Hunter. Is this a teaser to yet another series? Otherwise, it felt like an artificial roadblock put in the way of their happiness.On the plus side, I loved the karaoke scene, really enjoyed visiting with past characters, and thought the trip to Disney World was a nice touch. The bdsm aspects were tastefully done and Sarah and Gabe are very sweet together.Bell has set in motion her new ""Halle Shifters"" series as she introduces more shifter types into Halle. Gabe's ""friend"" Chloe plays a large role inBear Necessitieswhen her brother and cousin come to visit. It is nice to see her World developing, from coyotes in New York to Wolves in Poconos and now Bears and Foxes in Halle. It looks like an interesting, complex paranormal world. Definitely an author to keep an eye on.Overall, this is a good paranormal series with erotic tendencies. The books are reasonably short and mostly relationship-driven, with small dramatic plots to keep the stories running.  But in the end I just wasn't enamoured of this one. I wasn't sure if I really wanted Sarah to stay with Gabe, or stay quite so readily. But it is worth a read, if only to complete the Pumas series and slide into the ""Halle Shifters"".The ""Halle Pumas"" series:Book 1The Wallflower- Max and EmmaBook 2Sweet Dreams- Simon and BeckyBook 3Cat of a Different Color- Adrian and SheriBook 4Steel Beauty- Belle and RickBook 5  Only In My Dreams - Gabe and Sarah-CR-",0
"I got this because it was a free teaser for Kindle. You know the kind, give you a free sample of an author and hope you come back for more. Usually I find that the free-bees are not to my taste, but this one was fabulous. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had been longer. The storyline was creative and fresh. Fantasy meets detective style. I will definitely be looking for more from this author.",1
"Since Annie Simpson's husband died a year ago, she's been living a lonely, boring life. At first it helped her heal, but now her days seem empty and lacking purpose. One night, however, Annie enters her kitchen and is stunned and scared to see a large, gorgeous, naked man standing there. Before she can flee or call the police, James convinces her he's not going to hurt her. When Annie finds out he has come back to the past to flee the group intent on killing him, Annie thinks he's insane...at first. Then she starts to believe. Horrified by the grim picture of the future that James has painted, one of slavery and butchery, she offers to help. She's drawn to James in a way she's never felt before, not even with her husband, and when James is near her, she can't help but feel alive. When the full scope of the truth comes out, however, the question of life becomes a hotly contested topic, and Annie's previous blind faith may result in the death of everything she holds dear.Never Love a Stranger is a difficult book for me to review. I didn't like it, but I can appreciate what the author accomplished and what she was trying to accomplish. I think the concept of the book was good. It was an interesting plot and Fisher's vision for the future was pretty comprehensive and impressive. There were a lot of layers and deceptions, ill intents and heroic actions that blended together in an odd, yet compelling way. I can understand how some readers would find some of the revelations in this book to be disturbing, even though I'm not one of them. Yes, there were things in this book that were difficult to accept and not something you'd find in a traditional romance novel, but I found those aspects to add a sense of gritty realism to the motivations of the characters.That realism was appreciated, especially as I found it so lacking in other aspects. I had significant issues with character action and dialogue from the very first page. I felt neither were very believable through the whole of the book, and I can't imagine anyone with a modicum of self preservation acting as Annie did when she first saw James. The dialogue between the characters was often heavy-handed, trite, or cliched, and very little of it felt organic to the characters or the situations they found themselves in. The characters themselves, especially James, were inconsistent throughout and James' personality and vernacular fluctuated between believable for his backstory and situation to bordering on absurd. Any time a character who has supposedly traveled back in time from over three hundred years into our future, and has been shown to be perplexed by the identity and function of something as pedestrian as a bath towel may lose a lot of cred as future-guy when he starts uttering such modern colloquialisms as ""Go to hell.""I appreciated the author's intent, but this book is also beleaguered by a large schism that splits the book into two parts and turns a slightly common but basically harmless time traveler romance into a quagmire of scifi frustration and implausibility. I acknowledge that my preferences in reading lie elsewhere, so I don't want to appear hypercritical of issues that wouldn't please me if they'd been penned by Asimov himself, but I can't help but feel that the material and plot were larger than Fisher's ability to translate the ideas to the page. I hope that doesn't sound like harsh criticism, because I love that Fisher tried. I just don't think that there are many authors who can do it effectively and believably to begin with - time travel is literally littered with paradox and confusion, and defining an entire futuristic landscape in the span of half a book is a mighty task.Had Fisher's ambition for this story stopped at overcoming the...er...intrinsic differences...between Annie and James, I think I would have been okay with it, but all told, it was too big a concept and handled with too little sophistication to be enjoyable for me.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",0

"The story premise is an intersting one, but as a reader I was repeatedly brought out of the flow of the narrative by grammar mistakes.Like in the first two books, the writer exhibits no understanding of the proper use of the words he/him/himself, she/her/herself, I/me and they.Also, the use of the word 'floor' in particular is often misplaced, with jarring results. One cannot look down at the floor unless one is inside!If an editor was paid, get a refund. If not, get some grammar lessons.K Young, BA English Lit.",0
"This story had a different type of twist than most in it's catagory. I liked the characters and the writing overall but it wasn't one of those books that I just can't put down. If there is a second of it's kind, I won't be running out to buy it but would read it eventually.",0
"I have read quite a few YA books and have liked them, but this one not so much.The characters seemed to be lacking in personality and were just uninteresting to me. The story seemed to drag in certain areas as well. I basically HAD to make myself keep reading hoping the book would get better, but it never happened. The 'gasping' every time Lia shed a drop of blood was annoying.Some people might find this book interesting, but it just wasn't for me.Book Hollow[...]",0
"This novella starts in the middle of Sara's revenge against the entire race of vampires for the death of her brother and sister-in-law.  Wyatt is an ex-lover who saves her from destruction by revealing his own harsh truths and shining the light on her misguided conceptions.Yes, this is a story about vampires but it's too short to be too detailed into their world.  Wyatt eludes to laws and a governing body, but his main focus is keeping Sara safe, even from herself.This is a cute short story with just a hint of paranormal to it, Wyatt could have been any sort of paranormal creature, part of any number of different societies that Sara was hunting, even human.  She is a vigilante who wants answers but chooses to just kill any that are like the creature that killed her family.I would have liked it to be longer, only because there was so much left unsaid.  I would have liked to read about the past, about the murders and how she turned herself into a vampire hunter, and what happens next.  But that being said, it was decently written and I enjoyed it.  If you're looking for a quickie book, this will cover all the bases but not in any real depth.",0

Sex happens between them, but what could have been a relationship ends when he admits to her that he bought her bar and he's the reason she lost everything.The story was sweet, but very short.

"Henry Shaw can't seem to help his desire for Arsen Grey, Marquis of Somerville, despite their differing stations and the fact that they're both men.  When Arsen invites him to a house party, Henry agrees, even though he knows being around the object of his desire will be torture.  Was the invitation merely an act of friendship, or much more?Object of His Desire is a quick, hot Regency tale.  Large, almost shy Henry's devotion to Arsen is sweet.  Arsen is aristocratic and at times comes off as almost cold, but when his inner feelings peek out he's a worthy hero.  I enjoyed watching Henry and Arsen fumble from sex to something more, and reading about Henry's frightening past added depth to the story.  While Object of His Desire could have benefited, in my mind, from having more background and more on how Henry and Arsen's relationship turned out, it was an entertaining and hot read.  If you like Regencies and gay romance, as I do, Object of His Desire is definitely a story to pick up.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
Thank God this was free because it was so terrible. 1. Heroine meets hero 10 seconds later they are declaring they have feelings for each other and they have sex (she of course a virgin) 2. They then decide to go back to his Dragon lair after the heroines mother who is perfectly ok with it because what mother wouldn't be perfectly okay with it? 3. Then when they get to the lair there is this weird rule where she has to marry two men and that man falls in love the next day with her (mom is okay with this too bc mama Dragon told her it was the way things were)and they have some boring m/f/m sex..this is all intertwined with the dragons of course and that is also rather boring.

From the very first scene, he has supposedly achieved his goal of killing the man that killed his parents, the thing that haunts and drives him.

"I am not certain how Amazon would allow this book to be listed. A single sentence(this title is out of print) 6 words is not a book, story or even a paragraph. I downloaded this title simply to see if it was indeed a single page and low and behold it was! Fortunately it was free so I have no complaint on that score. It did prompt the thought that this is possibly Ledbetters's best work, but alas I will never know as I won't download anything from this author in the future.",0

She had legitimate gripes and didn't hold fast to her convictions.  I do like Maya Banks as an author and will not stop this book from reading others this however was somewhat a disapointment. A side note: I felt bringing a future child into this story kept me from enjoying it more.  I tend to get lost in the fiction and once a pregnancy was mentioned I tended to start to troubleshoot the arrival of an infant into this non-traditional household.  That's just me though.  Enjoy",0

What annoys me the most is that it could have been a good story with only a little bit off effort on the part of the author, and a fantastic story with just a little bit of editing. Neither of those occurred, and that's why it ticks me off to have paid even 0.99 for it.There's no excuse for lazy.",0

Aby and Keith were characters that could have gone somewhere but I was more interested in Gavin and Samantha's story. For this book to have been the first of the series, I would have expected more backstory for as many characters that were introduced here.Also, I waited for the shifting to begin.....Maybe in a moment where I wasn't looking, some shifting took place. During thr fight scenes (where you would have expected it, no one changed). Maybe I'll have to go back a re-read in order to appreciate the three and four stars that others gave this book.",0

Luc believed some photos that showed his mistress in a very compromising position with his own brother.  He then got rid of her believing family over her.  Six years later he discovers that his brother lied and that his own father put him up to it.  He then throws himself full throttle in to getting Skye back.  Believing her in all things and questioning his own father.  Very nice story about forgiveness and getting past preconceived notions of another.  The characters were well drawn but I suppose there was a question to get past though.  If Luc believed that his own brother would betray him like that why did he continue to get along with him?  Why did he continue to have a relationship with him but toss Skye out to the street?  The only thing that makes since is that Roberto was his brother and he could forgive him but not Skye.  Yet one would think that is a line that a BROTHER should never cross!! (therefore the reason for 4 stars),1

"A retired police chief is asked to help out In a murder investigation. I really enjoyed the set up of the main characters, retired police chief, living with a gay friend and working with the local police force on a consultancy basis. The reason I gave this four stars is because it would seem very unlikely that a civilian, albeit a retired police chief would be given such a free hand. Practically running the investigation on his own. Then when he finds peadophile  tapes he does not think this has much bearing on the case, but is looking for an unhappy house buyer??  The book is well written and I enjoyed it but came away a bit disappointed because of these points.Having said that I would definitely buy the next in the series and look for more books from this author",1

"NOTE: Most potential readers would probably assign a higher rating. But for me, certain little and not-so-little things snowballed to the point where cumulatively, it killed whatever good parts there were to the story.MEMORABLE QUOTE: ""To tell the truth of it my lord, aren't all men basically the same under their breeches no matter from whence they hail?""A closet fan of (non-Regency) historical romances and unfamiliar with Theresa Meyers, I had high hopes for ""The Spellbound Bride"" based on the blurb, the reviews and per the author, ""over two years of research"".

It bothered me on so many levels, I actually felt insulted.Apologies in advance if this review seems harsh but in order to justify the 1-star rating (a very rare personal rating), I have to touch on areas that I generally avoid (partly to suppress my personal preferences but mostly out of recognition of the hard work writers put into their stories).  Another personal dislike but... MINOR SPOILERS ahead.(1) CHARACTER/PLOT POINTS--HUH? I willingly suspend disbelief and critical thinking in order to enjoy fiction but sometimes, certain things are so jarringly wrong that they leap out and smack me in the face.  Occur early enough in the the story and my continued reading is forever tainted. Four major ""smack"" moments (without giving too much away):-- heroine's belief in being ""cursed by some dark deadly poison that dwelt insider [sic] her""... despite numerous NOTES left behind after incidents;-- heroine so skilled/knowledgeable, she brewed sleeping potions for her ""da""... at AGE 4;-- Archibald is the 14-year-old Earl of Argyll yet on a trip, only Ian and Sorcha travel with him (around a storyline so implausible that I was rolling my eyes); and-- apparent (lack of) passage of time in the second half of the book yet the heroine already had a ""slight swell""???(2) UM, WRITING STYLE? I can generally look beyond most writing styles but I simply couldn't understand the rationale behind splitting the speaker with the person's dialogue into separate paragraphs (ie, 1st sentence/paragraph is ""He frowned."" Next sentence/paragraph is the person's dialogue).Also, the one- or two-sentence narrative paragraphs became annoying. Maybe I'm old-fashioned but I expect such short paragraphs to be limited to crucial thoughts, information or turning points; too many and it becomes almost stream of consciousness, lacking cohesion and/or transitional writing skills. (At first, I though the foregoing was due to formatting/download error but nope, appeared throughout in parts to the end.  The wasted space (resulting in many more pages to turn) then made me think of ""Kindle abuse"".)Lastly, get a little too fancy with imagery and it can lead to output such as:""...an edge to his voice that was filled with both unsympathetic cold and hot anger..."" (I still can't figure this out)and ""...concern marring the dark trusting line of her brows..."" (what does a trusting browline look like?)As a reader, I don't want to be distracted like this. This is not Nietzsche, for goodness sakes!(3) HISTORICAL CONTEXT? This is the least of my problems with this book. I don't give a fig about historical accuracy so long as deviating from it serves some purpose (case in point: love ""Braveheart"" despite its utter trashing of historical facts).  However, given the author's long research in contrast to the actual amount of historical background incorporated into the story, I couldn't resist looking up the North Berwick witch trials after finishing this book.The story begins in 1593 but the actual witch trials occurred from 1590 to 1592. Also, King James VI married Princess Anne in 1589 but the story refers to her as a ""new bride"". I hate to say it but unless there was a typo in the prologue's dateline, I read nothing in the story that warranted using the later date of 1593.  Such a tiny, simple thing but that alone rendered the historical aspects of the story incongruous.This final point is truly just me and my upbringing. I try to give as much leeway as I can when foreign phrases pop up in books.  But sometimes... FYI, the first known use of the term ""tte-&agrave;-tte"" was in 1696. Could it have been in use before that?  Absolutely. 100 years before? Not likely. Its use in this story, let alone in *dialogue* ... well, you decide.",0
I really loved this book.  Shorter than the others but I really loved it!  The characters were feisty and fun.  They made you laugh and had some awesome steamy scenes.  Definitely a must read!,1
"This is a short book, a start to a wonderful new series.  Nalini Singh once again brings a whole new idea to paranormal romance.  I loved ""Angel's Pawn"" and the moment I was finished reading it I bought #2, ""Angel's Blood.""  I'm very excited to read any and all future novels from this very talented author.",1
I enjoyed the story and thought it was well done.  While like the other reviewer I didn't care for the foursome the rest of the book was done well.  It didn't fit into Rachel's character in the book who was so hurt and cautious.  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series but not if there are more secenes that seem completely out of place or character.,1
"I'm a fan of Ms. R.G Alexander's work. Ms. R.G Alexander is a talented author with a fruitful imagination. I purchased this book shortly after reading her ""Children of the Goddess"" series. Although i didn't have many reviews available to me before purchasing this book, I expected great things. Unfortunately i felt this book was a waste of time. I was less then impressed on the character development in this book. They just felt ""flat"". I kept reading it expecting it to get better. The plot also left much to be desired. I was uninvolved as a reader and didn't care one way or another about Charli and her men. I would characterize this book as trash. The only reason i gave it 2(1.5 not available) stars was because i like the amazing race idea. It's a shame the potential was never reached.",0
This book started off great then it was just annoying. It was the same thing over and over ...mistake/ forgive... another mistake/ forgive and yet another mistake/ forgive. Fool me once shame on you...fool me twice shame on me...( what about).fool me three times...?,0
"I really don't know why I chose this book to read, but I found that it needs some editing.  It also has bad language in it, which drops the rating for me.  I really would like to give it 3 1/2 stars, but that isn't possible, so I age it only 3 stars.I had to keep reading to see who was doing what, so I guess that is a plus in this book.  The ending, however, was terrible.I don't think I will be reading any other books by this author.",0
"Apollyon, the angel of death, has been guarding the bottomless pit of Hell for so long that he feels forgotten; that is until a beautiful woman summoned him. Serenity isn't just another woman, but a witch. She didn't mean to summon someone so powerful. It was supposed to be a simple vengeance spell that called to him. Even though the attraction is immediate, she doesn't believe an angel could be attracted to a simple human, at least not sexually. Surprise.As Apollyon exacts revenge on Serenity's ex-boyfriend, the two become lovers. Problem is, when his mission is up, will she be able to summon him again or will he have to go back to the gates of Hell?When it comes to reviewing books, I feel the rating and opinion is subjective. Some books, hit home. With ""Her Dark Angel,"" I didn't feel a connection with the characters or the story.  Surprising, since I love this subgenre. I'd like to try another series by this author though. Maybe I'll find the connection I'm looking for.",0
"I am naturally bent toward anything written about Alaska, I even consider the text on the blueberry teapackages  my son sends to be great literature, this was a nice story and good read, not Stabenow but good",1
Jessie and Caleb meet in an unusual way. She is recovering from the recent violent death of her husband Tommy. She is not interested in a new romance at this point. She is convinced by her childhood friend Todd to a attend a party where she will be safe from male attention;the party was a Gay Fest. Caleb is the brother of the host and the only straight male there. They are attracted to each other and become involved. Caleb helps her to try to solve the mystery of her husbands death and this puts them both in danger. A very sweet romance with suspense too.,0
"Why in the world did I download this weird little short story? Don't do it! Buy a real book, instead!",0
"It was complicate to follow the path of the plot, really haven't finished it yet... total waste of space on my kindle",0
"This was an Awesome Novella!! I may be a little biased because Z and Bella are my favorite...Ugh, no I am not...this was pretty Awesome.So Bella has her baby...a beautiful girl named Nalla.Now of course Z was so scared when she was in labor because he knew it was possible to lose Bella. But her and the baby pull through.So what is wrong with Z...why can't he touch, pick up, even look at his daughter. He keeps his distance. He calls Nalla, Bella's daughter...he does not claim her when talking with his family...keeps saying, ""the young"", ""her child""...etc. It is heartbreaking.Finally Bella can't take it anymore...""I need you to decide what you want to do,"" Bella said. ""If you can't be her father, I'm leaving you. I know that sounds harsh, but...I have to think of what's best for her. I love you and I will always love you, but it's not about me anymore.""It hurts my heart!Z goes on a mission and ends up hurt...all he can think about is Bella not being there when he gets back.When Bella comes to him...we learn what is wrong. We learn why he pulls away. His past is still very much a part of him and he is afraid...But should is daughter have to suffer???Really good short read for BDB fans!!",1
"So, he believed the worst of her continuously!! No matter that she was always proven to have said NOTHING but the truth, he always thought she was lying the next time. It was ridiculous. Let's not forget that after he believed the worst about her and ditched her and his brother for 6 months, he admits to sleeping with other women to get the heroine out of his mind. WOW!! What a man!!! She was miserable and talked bad about by him and he thinks he has the right to go on with his life while ruining everyone around him!! I do understand it better once he said that he had her checked on every few days to keep tabs on her and when the pictures of her and her therapist (he only say her hugging on a strange man repeatedly) came back to him, I think he thought she moved on and figured he should to. It never states whether he slept with the other women before that point or after. I would like him better if it was after but he still gets no points for personality!!!! I want to know what the test was that Alexis did to Daryle to make her think he only wanted her as a mistress. He showed up at the airport apologizing for hurting her but saying it was only to test her feelings and there was never anything else about it. What did he do to hurt her so badly and make her cry like that???? I would not read this book again!",0
I love the entire series. I love this new take on shape shifters of modern day. I could not get enough of the series and I await the next installment. Please keep it coming and for you I might even read the next Homoerotic jump off you have coming out.,1
"I can live with an anti-hero. I actually want characters to be multifaceted. So the character contradictions didn't really bother me.The novel started strong. There are a few jarring editorial problems. But the beginning moves well and draws the reader in.The middle introduces some new characters and foreshadows book 2. It also becomes a tad predictable. There is no doubt who the healer &#34;really is&#34; from almost the moment when he becomes more than a secondary character.The end just falls on its face and, literally, rolls in the mud. The whole story line has lead up to a scene of final confrontation AND the winner walks away without confirming the kill. &#34;I think he's dead&#34;. Really? He's won. There's a few NPC's hanging around who he has been stomping with ease and regularity and he walks away?Next logic flaw. The Ring Wraiths (opphhs, Ring Demons) show up charged by their cruel and evil master to GET THE RING. And some guy is so glib as to talk them into coming back in a few days and he'll find it for them. And we don't even get to see the scene where he does this, just hear that he did it after the fact. That must have been some amazing dog and pony show and we missed it.The ending is confused, incomplete, rambling, illogical, and little more than a lead in to book 2. And because of that I don't care enough to buy or read book 2.",0
"It was an easy couple of hour read for me that was pleasant enough for a free book.  It's the same old story though, a young couple lose their lives leaving an orphaned child to a rich sibling to take care of.  It was just a bit sad at times all the references to the deceased couple but turned out HEA and the child very much loved. The author has a nice writing style, this is my second book by her and I'll be looking for other free ones.  Enjoy",0
"I understand that what I disliked about this book was mainly preference. But the guy seems controlling and abusive, no matter how many times he says he cares, it just doesn't show. When she talks about how she is struggling with her family, he isn't supportive, he gets angry and tells her to walk away from it. Parts of this book made me sick to my stomach. A woman who doesn't think she deserves anything for herself, gets into an abusive relationship, then when she questions this relationship and who it is turning her into, the author portrays her as turning her back on a wonderful thing. I guess if the dominant / submissive thing is your thing, you might like it. I am just a fan of books where the lead characters have not only self respect, but they respect each other. I will never read this author again.",0
"This book is different from other shifter books, most shifters only shift to one form, in this case the female lead shifts into two forms. The love triangle thing was a little confusing but the book was interesting.",0
"Yes it was free, and that's the only reason I ""purchased"" it.  I don't know precisely why, but I never felt connected to the story.  There was a lot of time and space devoted to sex between the two main characters in the book (far too much space, actually), but the characters never pulled me into the story at all.  The basic premise of the book just never caught my interest, and I didn't really care about what was happening or any of the characters.  If I had to put my finger on what was wrong about this book, it would be that there was hardly any back-story to the characters.  The author also relied on conclusive statements that seemed to come out of the blue, rather than letting the characters' motivations and reasoning evolve naturally through the story.It was actually a chore to get myself to finish reading the book, starting from about a third of the way into it.  Not that the first third of the book was any better - that's just how long I would give an author to warm up and hook me into their story.  The sex scenes were too frequent and too long, to the point that the underlying story was never developed in any meaningful way.  It's ebooks like this that make me miss the ability to jump ahead in a paper book, quickly flipping past several pages until I can see where a particularly boring scene has ended and the story picks up again.  I would not read any sequel to this book, even if it were free.  I wouldn't try another, unrelated story by the same author, unless perhaps it, too, was free.",0
"I did make it all the way through this book, but kept thinking it was going to get better.  It was interesting, but it was not a book that I rushed to pick up.  I was curious enough that I kept reading until the end, but when I was finished I wondered why I had worked so hard to get to the end.",0
"I am partial to post-apostoliptic (spelling?)books, movies whatever and in this respect this book was no disapointment.  As a relative unknown author, I admire his courage and stick-to-i-tiveness in this first book of the series.  I nearly quit reading about a third of the way through, but desided to give this guy the benefit of the doubt and finished.  By golly he's doing really well.  He could use a second set of eyes to help him edit typos and such, but aside from that I was glad I didn't give up on the author.  I have read the whole series and enjoyed it.  Fare thee well Mr. Sides; fare thee well.  rsmquilts  R. Sharon McGovern",1
"Plot:The only way to warm Kate after her car rolled into the river was naked between two hot cowboys. One thing leads to another and a hot and steamy snowed in weekend follows. But can it be for keeps?Comments:- 1833 kindle locations, but winds up around 1580.- m/f/m, m/f, m/m. Generous, lusty, fun, varied. No bdsm, toys or any other accessories. A different take on the m/m - they are cowboys who spend long winters together and don't mind helping each other out. But never saw themselves as a committed couple. While we start out as a fun menage for a few days, we end up aiming for a committed threesome.Opinion:Erotic contemporary cowboy menage with lots of revenge sex and a nice HEA. This is a nice little book but it isn't anything spectacular. It is disappointingly short, but it is complete. Nothing is left to be said. All plot strands are wound up. I like the ending, I like that Kate is given the opportunity to make an intelligent, considered decision (so unusual in these books!) and I like that it is simply a Naughty Weekend that just maybe takes us to Forever. There are no Bad Guys, no-one is Wounded, no Angst. We simply get lots of sex and then a HEA (with more sex *grin*). It is what it is.Aside:The m/m instance is a little more uncomfortable than I expected. I have read m/m where they are committed and ready and willing to go for it when the opportunity arises. It is natural. I have read m/m where at a point during the menage a decision is made to test the waters and hey! look at that! we like it. It's organic. But ""Saddled"" is a little different. More forced. The men aren't so willing to go down that path with Kate there (although they have in private). And the issue is somewhat taken out of their hands by the games they are playing. It changes the dynamic. No one is ""forced"" but IMO it gets a little grey and drops this from a low 4 stars to a high 3.-CR-",0
This was not a book I would especially recommend. The writing style was not great and the story was kind of predictable.  It is just a nice light summer read but I wouldnt recommend it.,0
"The problem I had with this book was that we didn't get enough from her, so the S&M; came off as abusive more than anything else. Sorry, but a guy telling her that she needs to be hurt when he has no idea who she is and she has absolutely no reason to trust him? Totally offensive, even with the paranormal component. I wouldn't have had issue with it if we'd gotten a similarly strong message from her (even if the message was 'OMG, I don't want to need this but I do'). There just wasn't enough of that, so he came off as an arrogant douche who enjoyed forcing a woman into something she wasn't ready for. And the fact that he was preparing her for the big...climax, but didn't actually tell her anything and just kept her begging and worrying wasn't cool or hot.This was fairly uncomfortable for me to read, and frankly, that doesn't happen very often.",0
"This book was interesting, but to short and the sex scene was not explicit enough. I wish the book had been a little more wordy.",0
I love dragons and this story is one of the better ones with a whole different approach. It's full of what seem like original ideas to me.I'm so glad that the author didn't fall into the cliffhanger trap that so many apply to their series of books. This is a lovely story that stands alone but gives you enough enticement to go one to read the rest of the series.Nice easy to read writing style and good characterization - Well done Jenna.,1
"Amazon assures me this is a full-length novel but since I read it in one sitting, I'm having trouble accepting their word for it. That aside, it did move very quickly and it's a lot of fun, especially if you can keep track of where everybody is and what they're doing. There's no real depth to the characters but hey, it's a comedy, they don't have to be deep to be funny.The book could use another proofreading pass, but if you can get past the spelling, grammar, etc., then it's worth some time. Normally I'd knock a half-star or full star off for the errors, but it did keep me up reading pretty late. So we'll call this one a full four stars.",1
"Horror anthologies have been scant this year and I bought this last years' collection not knowing what to expect.  Well, what a pleasant surprise.  The stories are B+ to A, fresh and interesting.  The best for me, ""The Wild Hunt,"" where the veil between the living and dead is ripped open on the winter solstice.  Tried to find another Spinetinglers on the Kindle, but unfortunately none.  Highly recommended.",1
"I've been waiting for this next installment in the Halle Pumas stories.  Love all these characters.  Lots of humor, passion, suspense, and a$$-kickin shifters!  This one doesn't disappoint.  Both Belle and Rick are strong characters and perfect for each other.  Read this series if you haven't.  Read them in order too.  Can't wait for the next one.  There better be one!!!",1
"Another collection of short stories, and like the first anthology (No Good Deed), the connection to the River City novels is in there, it's just not always prevalent. And similar to the first anthology, the final product is uneven at best. There are a few good stories, but many of the offerings remind me of what a high school course of Beginning Story-Writing would produce. Some of these are so bad they left me seriously considering abandoning the rest of the book. Instead of 17 short stories, many of which were too short on plot, detail, and ending, I'd have preferred half as many stories with somewhat more complete and conclusive plotlines. The book's final story (Alan Hart) was well worth the price of admission, but I had to slog through an uneven bunch of good, so-so, and downright bad stories to get there. FWIW, I absolutely loved the first three River City novels, but so far these anthologies leave a lot to be desired, in my opinion.",0
"Engaging writing, fabulous world building each story culminating into an epic climax that would go so far out there I was left going 'What?' I dislike it when characters all of a sudden, out of exhaustion, injury etc suddenly acqiure new almost god like abilities. But the world she created is so intriguing I can skim those irritating bits for the most part.",0
"I enjoyed the book, I dislike reviewing L'Aour's books because I haven't found one I did not like.He writes about the part of the country I love and of course I love westerns also.  In this book, as wellas others he has written it is a good cast of characters and the story line is easy to follow.I could write mnore but then I would be into the book.  Good read.",1
"Aggie is Angela Lansbury who carries pocketbooks instead of writing them. While this light murder mystery is laced with misdirections, the clues lead to a rather obvious cliche of an ending. The setting,  views described in the story are its best and most believable parts, and Aggie the only well-written character. Very light reading.",0
"I think my biggest problem with the story was how totally unbelievable it was. Trey is told like an hour before he has to leave that he is going on a undercover mission. Carly a bartender is the only person they can find that looks like the wife of the man Trey will be pretending to be. In the course of an hour Carly is brought in and agrees to go on the mission with him. She is prior military but spend her military career behind a desk and knows nothing about undercover work.... but somehow in the vast network of the government they can find no one to play the part so this big role falls on her shoulders.Treys best friends is in love with Carly and Trey spends the whole time worrying about hurting his friends feelings because they are under constant surveillance and have to act like a couple. But it sure didnt bother him having sex with her right in front of the ""hidden"" camera in their motel room, as a distraction.The story had no build up. I was total BS and boring. There was no climax and by the end of it I was seriously wondering why I kept going.I gave the book two stars because I liked the best friend.",0
"My Review by Carlyn - BMR Guest ReviewerLark has been in love with her cousin Taran for years. Don't worry they are cousins only by a late marriage so no ick factor! What she doesn't know is that she is actually the alpha wolf, Taran's, mate. He has been keeping his feelings and his mating instinct a secret because he thinks she will reject him because they are family. When Lark becomes in danger after inadvertently becoming involved in one of Taran's police investigations he must protect her and his own heart.In this world, werewolf's are a known species so there was no big species shocker for Lark which made the storyline flow with ease. I really liked the characters in this story. Taran is still a gruff and bossy alpha wolf but he still has a sense of humor and you can understand why he kept his feelings from Lark. Lark is absolutely hilarious and she loves teasing Taran. She is also not afraid to go after what she wants when she puts her mind to it.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves shifters, romance and some red hot love scenes! I look forward to reading more books from this author.5 out of 5 stars.",1
Good series. The paperback has all 3 in one book- be aware. different on kindle.,1
"I absolutely love Maggie Shayne's books. I love how the stories stand alone but also tie together to reveal a wider world. This collection does not disappoint. Through the volume, the reader gets to follow the lives of multiple vampire couples as they try to secure their place in their world, find true love and stay out of the clutches of an evil government agency that is hell bent on destroying them. Great binge reading material!",1
"I loved this story! It was very short, but had all the gore and suspense you need for a quick, entertaining read. Perfect!",1
i didnt know what to expect but i really liked this it was a fun read it was romantic and tender i will read more from this author.,1
Got caught -this has been previously published in an anthology - this is not made clear in the product summary. Adds to the Guild Hunter storyline and back story.,0
"Humorous, strong overused language, sexual situations. I needed to put that first to make sure your forewarned. The story really isn't that good but the humor of the pranks Linda pulls on her boyfriend after her death make it almost bearable.",0
Awful.  I wanted to delete this garbage just after reading first 100  or so pages. but thought it must have some redeeming qualities...wrong.  main female character unbeliavably unsymphatic. Justin should have told her Buh..bye in no uncertain terms. Waste of money and time.,0
I have enjoyed the characters and plots in every Elaine Overton book I have read so far and this is no exception.  Very Good read!,1
"This was my first Marie Harte story. My first reaction was a bit sceptical - only 83 pages? How can a book draw you in with only 83 pages? Surprisingly, it did. Who hasn't had a crush, been embarrassed, or done something they normally wouldn't when imbibing with their best gal pals? Now I'm a Marie Harte fan!",1
"I recommend this rating because this book is the BOMB. There is no better she could write and write about every one in the family and when you think a young girl or man is being left to dry there she comes up with a another scenario . It is really captivating . All the books are good and not a put down .No finish reading all as yet but I recommend them anyway for any age young, middle age older there is something there for all of us.",1
"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U0Q17K/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThey aren't in the Bible because somebody at a council close to 1700 years ago decided they shouldn't be in the Bible. However, some Bibles are printed with the Apocrypha between the Old and New Testament, which is a good place for them. They include history, wisdom literature, and prophecy (well hidden). If you're going to read Josephus, who is a monumentally boring writer but the only source for many things, take pity on yourself and read the Apocrypha first.If you aren't going to read Josephus, read the Apocrypha anyway. It's well worth reading. I enjoyed it the first time I read it, and during subsequent readings.",1
Love love loved this bundle!  The stories were all different and yet they all linked together.  It was a great read!,1
"I give it five stars.Unbreakable by Sydney Somers is a fantastic action filled story, in the tradition of Buffy The Vampire Slayer that I found almost impossible to put down. The chemistry between the main characters as well as the secondary ones is outstanding.When the story first starts Jordan and her partner / lover Gage are brutally attacked by a war demon and in the process the fatally injured Gage ends up dying in her arms.Fast forward five years into the future, Jordan is still a cop by day but by night she's an a** kicking demon slayer with an attitude! So imagine her anger and hurt when she discovers that Gage didn't really die that night. Instead he's stayed away for the last five years in a misguided attempt to protect her from the shadow demons that she hunts and slays every night.This book is definitely a keeper. If you love stories about demons, heroes, hot sex and a great love that won't be denied then you are sure to love Unbreakable.",1
"My major issue with this work is that it starts and stops three separate times. Fascinatingly, each separate start is a really good premise! But its frustrating for the reader because the characters are put back to square one and repetition and redundancy ensues.A second issue, is that the world building is lacking. I don't understand the wolf culture. Neither the old ways or the new ways were explained. So when the twist happened and the wolves went back to the old ways allowing Zan and Brant to be together I didn't really feel an impact. And we don't get more about Zan's background until the end, and it wasn't that much. Lucas seems to be worldly and wealthy, where Zan only finished high school and works at a cafeteria and then a perfume counter. I needed more reasons behind the attraction.Another reviewer mentioned that Brant did not stand up for Zan. He let Lucas walk over him and her and their relationship. Brant did not layeth the smack down upon his brother when Lucas saw them having sex not once, but twice! And the second time it wasn't just Lucas who got a sneak peek! Un unh! And worse, Zan didn't call him on it.I really liked that this was an interracial PNR, but I wish I had known whether there were any other skin tones in the pack? Was it not a big deal that Zan was black because there were other shifters of color? I was constantly thinking about that.",0
"Really shouldn't have Han Solo on the cover as he doesn't come into the story.This story is all about Chewbacca and his family.I won't give anything away, but it is a nice, if short, read.",1
"The characters are over-the-top stereotypes (clueless dork and nasty young women).  The way this world works isn't clear - the story is very short, so I don't want to spoil anything, but it really defies belief that a company would have a resource like that, use it in that very limited way (which isn't even something you'd need in real life!), and that low-level employees would know about it.  The ending is like an unsatisfying joke.  I felt like I wasted the few minutes it took to read it.",0
It is hard for a book to be timeless and this one was definitely aged - Not as clever as it thought it was in these current times.,0
"The Delver world is most believable and truly detailed.With magic on the loose, there are strange happenings, old boundaries are broken and attacks of vengeance are made.With this second book... we see more of the interactions between all the different races and humans... as the fight for survival is on. Intense battles.I found this book a good follow to book one of the series, Delver Magic.Ryson Acumen, the delver... is the hero and is in the center of all the action. It's a great fight between good and evil set in a believable world that captures me and makes me look around curiously when I surface from the reading and make the transition back to my world and life!The ending of this book leaves many unresolved issues and I am eagerly looking forward to reading book 3!If you love fantasy, like action, enjoy watching strong characters learn and grow, like a touch of paranormal... you'll enjoy this book. I highly suggest you read the first book in the trilogy first.",1
"Well written, excellent book.The author pulls you in and doesn't let go.Oddly enough, even though the main characters are contract killers, you still feel an empathy for both of them. It is truly amazing how the author manages to make you identify with these people.Multiple surprises within the book keep you truly entertained.",1
Delightful read for the Kindle. Suspenseful for a who done it Book. Twists and turns to make you wonder who the murderer was...certainly not expected.,1
"After four books that leads the reader to a wonderful crescendo, I felt like I got totally ripped off with this book in more ways than one!  There was NOT ONE OUNCE of story telling or plot development, no new characters introduced to facilitate more books, not even a cliff hanger that would keep you interested and waiting for the next book in the series.  I felt I was reading more of an erotic sex SHORT STORY than a continuation of a series that I came to feel invested in it's characters and plots.  I was sorely disappointed that from the first few pages of the book, there was nothing but very detailed descriptions of sex acts between three people.  Don't get me wrong, that's what a ""Romance Novel"" has in it, but this wasn't even ROMANCE!  I won't even bother to go into the proof reading errors I found, nor the fact that our heroine's mate acts COMPLETELY out of character(what happened to him, PTSD???). I can honestly say, I am seriously thinking about whether or not I want to continue reading the series after feeling so let down by the lack substance, story telling or even imagination.  NOT thrilled...  and again not sure I will continue the series.  This was a serious let down for me.  Regardless of how others review it at ""hot"" and a ""good read"".  Obviously they don't read enough to know the difference between a story line, and a porno short story.  Wow...  just ugh.",0
this is great to have as a backup and it is just what I wanted and ordered. I would recommend this package,1
"This book will definitely raise some temps... Woo hoo... Fast read, but well worth it.  Sweet and sexy all in one...",1
"This really should be billed as adolescent fiction the characters are final year college students coming to terms with their true nature as gay.  The story is implausible, does anyone really sleep cuddling their best friend for four years and not realise they are gay?  Written to appeal to stereotypical gay fantasy figures two college football jocks fall in love, at the same time reinforces negative stereotyping with descriptions such as twinks.  A very short read less than a hundred pages on kindle neither worth the money time or effort.  Fundamentally unsatisfying. Sexist comment maybe but I really am not sure how a female author can write effectively about gay male themes, has to contain a strong element of voyeuristic smut.  Evangeline should leave it to the men. Cardboard cut out characters, supposedly intelligent soon to be graduates using language and having thoughts more appropriate to grade school than soon to be professional people.  One to forget!",0
"Which is worst, being a masochistic Cubs fan who knows your team will lose or a Boston Red Sox fan, who's team continually knocks at the door, yet can't seem to win the ultimate prize by coming out on top in the World Series?  Genius scientist and diehard Red Sox fan Greg Patterson has an opinion and decides to do something about it.  With a not-so-subtle nod to the ""Back to the Future"" movies Patterson sets out to fix this problem at what is generally acknowledged as the beginning, the events surrounding the trading of Babe Ruth to the hated Yankees in 1919.I'm no sports guy, but found the story easy to follow despite that.  Most with even a passing acquaintance to sport will have picked up enough baseball facts to follow that part.  But at its heart ""Turning Back the Clock"" is more than a simple fantasy/sci-fi novel or a baseball story or a glimpse at history, although it is all of those.  It's also a lesson in doing the right thing.  In seeing a need and filling it.  And a bit of a love story as well.",1
"Good book. Easy to follow along, good plot and characters. Interesting world choice. It is a good book to get you thinking.",1
"In order to save his pawned guitar, Ted Hogwood accepts an assignment from a branch of the government that isn't even official. His partner on this assignment is Jerry Kwiatkowski and their mission is to steal a boomerang that contains secrets that should have died with J. Edgar Hoover. What stands in their path? A crossbow wielding assassin, two unemployed Australian women, the director of Central Intelligence and an ex-cheerleader!Got your attention yet? Is your eyebrow raised? It should be! This book was a really fun read and Alan's writing style reminded me at times of the late Douglas Adams. The deeper into the plot you get, the more you can tell the characters are in a situation that's way over their heads. It's quirky, funny and really hard to put down. I found myself wondering how this all would come together and then when it did I was highly amused. It was really sad when this fun trip ended and I do hope to see these characters again somewhere down the road.",1
"Just what I wanted in a Science Fiction Novel.  Easy to read and understand.  Action and story are all topnotch. Recommend to everybody who likes SciFi.  May have gotten the reviews out of sequence when reviewing, but all three novels have been exceptionally well written and I hope the author has more out there to add.",1
"I had a hard time dealing with the content of this story. It was heartbreaking, and I felt so bad for the author, wanting to take her away forever. But I did not like the way the ending left me hanging, wanting me to buy the next of her books to find out how it ends.",0
"This book was good enough. I don't regret buying it.But it's not what I expected. It's well-written and edited enough, resulting in a polished and driving book.But it's not vintage Lanyon, and that may be the problem for me. None of his wonderful dry wit. None of his effortless twisting of plot and characters. And, most definitely not Lanyon, it is rife with gay romance conventions and formulas.Dear God, can anyone write gay fiction, any more, without a tear-jerking hospital stay or handicapped heroes? Not to mention the gratuitous &#34;need to be dominated&#34; theme that seems to have grown out of the market popularity of 50 Shades of Grey?Honestly, it seems such a waste to squander such lush characters and fast-paced writing on 20-page sex scenes and trite (but apparently obligatory) M/M romance memes.Fortunately, this was an early work (Kindle edition published 2009) and Mr. Lanyon's subsequent writing was neither conventional nor trite. I'm so glad he found his voice and gifted us with such wonderful books.As for this one, had I known what it was, I would have gladly given it a pass.",0
"Rating:  4.5 starsThis book was a dark read and it is not anything like FSOG--it's about Master/slave and about a Dom/sub.  The story takes place at Judgment-a secluded fortress type mansion that holds hundreds of women captive and who will be sold into slavery. Callie first given the name Red because of her hair and later renamed Mischief by her Master was kidnapped and brought to Judgment. When Mischief arrives at the compound she fights her captives and pays the price. Her defiance earns her attention from Tane-the head Master-on her first night at Judgment. Her defiance continues as does his fascination with her.Her defiance continues and that is what earns her the name Mischief. She is eventually broken when she tries to escape and lands in the arms of Tane. He sentences her to a caning and waiting she does something that earns her a total of 30 strikes of the cane.While we are learning about how Mischief was captured and tortured into complete submission the author also dives into the physiological state of Mischief. There are other interesting aspects to this story.  There is a whole hierarchy of slaves-the top being Personals.When presented with a real chance of escape I was shocked at her response-which really just goes to show you how beaten down and broken she really became.  Overall, there are some twists and turns in this story and there is ALOT of violence and some steamy scenes. I found myself talking to my iPad because I was baffled, appalled, or just totally shocked by some scenes.Thanks for reading my review!!",1
I enjoyed reading this book. I liked the story and how it kept my attention from beginning to end. I will continue to check out this authors other books.,1
This book was absolutely terrible there was incorrect grammar and spelling  you should not waste your money on this book,0
this one will leave you wanting more and more. It also too short and will leave you panting in one seen.,0
"I felt cheated out of a chance to curl up for a couple of days with a read to keep me company for longer than an hour.  If you are not really into reading, and have to spend an hour or two on a flight, by all means, get this book.  Otherwise, spend your time elsewhere.",0
As an Elvis fan I was slightly insulted with the way Elvis' memory was handled.  And the plot development was thin.,0
"RUBY TUESDAY by Mari Carr.STORY BRIEF:Teagan plays guitar and sings folk songs in her family's Irish pub.  She likes writing music and performs one of her original songs.  Sky is a rock star, traveling incognito, trying to avoid the paparazzi.  He came to town for a few weeks for some quiet time to write music.  He happens to be in the pub when Teagan performs.  He likes her song and asks her to be a cowriter, working with him to write some songs.  At first she refuses, but then agrees after losing a bet to him about music knowledge.  They spend a lot of time together.  They are sexually attracted to each other.  She is a virgin and wants to wait until she falls in love before having sex.  He respects that, so they play with each other sexually without taking her virginity.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I wasn't surprised or delighted with anything.  The characters, dialogue, and plot were ordinary, nothing new.  It wasn't bad.  I kept reading out of curiosity, but I wasn't drawn in.  Although he is protecting her virginity, he gets into some kinky sexual things right away which was odd.  He ties her hands, spanks her, uses a toy, and includes rear door activity.DATA:Reading time: 2  hours.  Kindle count story length: 2665 (262 KB).

My husband is a workaholic with his own business like Logan and Rhys so I so understood the hurt the leading lady felt in feeling like your husband is married to the job instead of you.  I love how Maya shows the struggles and the rewards that are the roller coaster of life and that sometimes a woman has to stop being a doormat and make hard choices in order to be truely happy.  Let me also just add that this book has some of the hotest and raw menage love scenes that I have read before or since.  I read this book months ago and the images haven't faded in the least which is why Maya Banks is one of my top 5 favorite authors!!,1
"If you download only free books, don't bother. This is only a short intro to a series...but it is very good, and is an impressive sample from this author.",1
What a great read. Gena tells a sweet side story that flows right along with her Lords of the Underworld.,1
"First let me say that I obtained this book when it was offered for free in January!  Thank heavens for small favors.  No, really.  I cannot speak to the plot because of the terrible formatting.  Irregular word spacing, odd word breaks make this more work than it is worth.  The story starts with a Prolouge and the formatting errors start right there on page 1.Now that the book is no longer free, I would be mighty miffed if I had to pay 4.99 and had to decipher each page.  Formatting can be done correctly, there should be no reason for this type of sloppy editing.  It detracts from the story and isn't that what you're paying for?  Save your money on the Kindle edition and if you like this type of genre, spring for the paperback.  The Kindle edition is a waste of time.",0
"Elle and Dan get their HEA!!! &#34;Dirty&#34; ended with a &#34;Happyish Ever After,&#34; but I was still relatively satisfied. &#34;Reason Enough&#34; is the perfect epilogue for &#34;Dirty&#34; and I couldn't ask for more!",1
"This was a page Turner that offered suspense, faith, and love all rolled up in one. It was nice to read a story where there was a lot of meat to story and not a lot of sexual situations. I will be reading the rest of this series.",1
"I like a good Templar story as well as the next person, but this one isn't one of them. The story is uneven, characters with no particular reason to like or care for them, and just an odd collection of 'steps as story'. Surprise at the end, is, well, not much of a surprise and I didn't really care by that time.Sorry, but a miss.",0
I thought this book might give me some ideas for my girls school lunches. I was so wrong. I support a family of four on one income and the ingredients for these recipes are outrageous. I guess we'll stick to PB&J for now.,0
The main protagonist of this novel runs a high powered protection agency with celebrity and political clients.  Unknown to these he is also a paranoid schizophrenic controlled on drugs.  When these are withdrawn he degenerates into total schizophrenia and becomes programmed to attack those he is engaged to protect.  His personal relationships also understandably start to disintegrate also as he decompensates. Is this just his schizophrenia or a plot to assasinate.  The story grips throughout and is well worth the read.  Could have had a little better editing but the pace of the tale gets over these minor problems.  Great for a debut novel and look forward to the author's further offerings.,1
"Bedding her younger co-worker would be a very big mistake.  Amy knows this, but it doesn't seem to curb the growing lust she feels for Justin Garrett.

Heck, this little jewel would heat up even the hottest day in August!  Although Unwrapped is set during the Christmas holidays, it is a story that can be enjoyed year round, and I can tell you it is one I will definitely re-read.I am not usually drawn to romances between older women and younger men, but the age difference between Amy and Justin never felt like an issue to me at all.  The moment you feel the romantic tension between this pair, you will think of nothing but your need for them to consummate their undeniable attraction for each other.As if one hunk wasn't enough in this story, Justin introduces his long-time friend into the relationship for one unforgettable night fulfilling all of Amy's most secret m&eacute;nage desires.Anyone who loves smoldering romances that include M/F/M m&eacute;nage should rush over to Samhain Publishing right away to purchase their own copy of Unwrapped and settle in for a night of steamy sex and heart-warming romance!",1
i like the fact the main character was bisexual and not full on gay... cause i dont care for woman turning a gay man out plot. the one thing that i didn't care for was how one minute he was dead set on not having a menage with her and another man but yet the next minute he had no problem doing it with an unknown guy. i think there was enough scenes in the book to make you believe those two as a couple,1
"The entire premise of this book is that the heroine gets revenge on the boy who overlooked her when she was too plump in high school by returning to town slim, trim, and luscious.  This initial idea for a novel intrigued me, but this author failed on the key point.As soon as the overlooked woman captured the man's attention she fell into his arms.  How is that getting revenge? Getting revenge would have been  for her to ignore him now that she is gorgeous and slim. She should have had another good, solid man for a love interest.  That would have made the novel much more satisfying for me.I have read two novels by this author now and did not like either one.  I will not be buying anymore of her work.",0
"This short book had a VERY DARK SIDE. When a woman is lonely, how far will she go to fulfill her needs? Things seem to be going okay at first but then manbot goes crazy. Story wasn't what I expected but I still liked it.",1
"The life of a fifty-five year-old Master gardener may not sound very exciting, but for Demetria, gardener and Master Magician in the Kingdom of Sage, it's anything but dull. With the Rat Kingdom threatening the western border, and the snakes of the Slithering Kingdom coming in from the south, Sage has its share of troubles. And since Demetria is the first line of her kingdom's defense, she keeps very busy.Sage: Tales from a Magic Kingdom, is a collection of three novellas, each containing a well-plotted, magical adventure. Using only a few thousand words, the author creates a unique world peopled with interesting characters. There is a sense of adventure in every story as Demetria uses her plant magic to rescue her family as well as her kingdom. It's also a pleasant change to read about a heroine who defies stereotypes. Demetria may be grandmotherly and sweet, but she is a courageous combatant nonetheless.This is a fun read, suitable for readers of all ages. I definitely recommend Sage: Tales from a Magical Kingdom.This review was originally published on my blog, Cheap Thrills - [...]",1
"Denise Agnew knows how to write hot, military men and this book is no exception. The communication in the form of letters between Eve and Sean add to their chemistry and elevate the sexual tension to flaming intensity. MALE CALL has all elements of a fun, sexy book that will keep you wanting more. Fortunate for Denise Agnew fans, there are more books in the Hot Zone series. I recommend MALE CALL and the other books in the series. You will not be disappointed.",1
"The graphics and general storyline seem okay, and definitely want to see the end of the book. But angies husband is a stifling know-it-all.",0
"The storyline was great and every character - except Nicolette - was very easy to like.  I wanted to pummel Nicolette!  She is a useless, spoiled, egotistic brat!  I love him...I hate him...I love him...  I wanted Jarrod to dump her sorry self and find ANYONE else!",1
"4.5 StarsCatherine Cullen-Wellesley is devastated when her husbands forget their date to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary, thus also ruining the surprise she had for them. At least they still had their upcoming two week vacation to Jamaica where they would have some much needed time uninterrupted. When Logan and Rhys postpone that to jet off on a last minute business trip, Catherine has to face the facts that her marriage is in serious trouble. Desperate for some time to think, she decides to go on that vacation without (telling) them. When Logan and Rhys return home to find her gone, they realize they're on the verge of losing the woman they love. Not willing to let her go without a fight, they chase after her and spend the next two weeks trying to gain her forgiveness as well as her trust.This story was an emotional roller coaster ride fro beginning to end. At first it was easy to side with Catherine. She's felt neglected for a long time, more so since Logan and Rhys began building their company from the ground up. Then we get glimpses into the minds of Logan and Rhys, and it becomes apparent that they love Cat beyond measure. They're not bad, just oblivious. When they finally catch up with her, they don't waste any time trying to convince her she's still their number one priority. However actions speak louder than words, and act they do.Catherine accepts responsibility that she's partly to blame for the breakdown of their marriage because she never told them how she really felt whenever they put the company before her. I liked that Logan and Rhys acknowledged that they'd messed up. They didn't try to dictate her around or make her feel guilty. However, after we find out about their background and that their quest to be financially successful was as much for her as it was for them, it made Cat seem clingy, needy and selfish (but it could have been her pregnancy hormones adding fuel to the fire). Despite being on vacation with her, they still had a company to run, and they left without leaving instructions behind, so it really bothered me that she would tense up and get angry or fearful whenever they'd take a work call or work email. Before things get better, there's a misunderstanding and more drama for them to overcome. In the end I think they redeemed themselves by making compromises that seemed so simple. If only they had come to that conclusion sooner. Hindsight is 20/20 and I think their relationship only got stronger because of all the heartache.Though the love scenes were steamy, I found myself skimming them. They weren't bad, but I was just more invested in the characters and their personal growth as they tried to navigate the pitfalls of work and marriage. This was an excellent read.",1
Definitely a great read if you like the series!  This is just one of the many paranormal romance authors that i ready.  You can read them out of order but may make more sense if you start from the beginning.,1
At least it was free and now I know to avoid the author in the future. Gratuitous torture and poorly written.,0
An ill fated escape by balloon ended up being a disaster depositing 5 men and a dog on a seemingly deserted island.  Where they worked to start a colony of sorts and where they experienced many hardships and triumphs.  A classic story filled with well defined characters and interesting locale.  The one downfall was it was somewhat wordy and of course some of the explanations of the scientific kind were outdated.  But those small complaints does nothing to diminish the quality of the tale itself.,1
"As posted on The Smutty Kitty4 out of 5 LicksWhen I discovered there was a book by Jayne Rylon that I hadn't read yet I knew I needed to rectify the situation immediately.  Dream Machine takes us into the world of Becca's dreams and let me tell you this woman has some sexy dreams about her boss Kurt.  Kurt and Becca make such a great couple because they each spend quite a bit of time fighting the growing love between them-one of my favorite things for characters to do is fight the attraction.  These two may be fighting the love portion of the attraction but thanks to science they are not fighting the sex portion.  lol  Thanks to Becca's wicked dream desires they have all kinds of hot kinky sex.  I'm quite happy to say we get our HEA for Kurt and Becca although the path at the end got very rocky.My favorite part about this book though was Luke.  He is one of those secondary characters that just took over for me.  When he was in the scene he had my complete attention and sometimes even when he wasn't around I was thinking about him.  I'm thrilled to say he recently got his own book,Healing Touch (Play Doctor), come back tomorrow for that review.  If you love Jayne Rylon, and quite frankly how could you not, then make sure you add this book to your collection.  This one is sure to leave you with pleasant dreams.",1
Interesting book however I found it a little slow.  I've read the next 2 books in the series and found them very interesting.  I am looking forward to #4.,0
I have read all the books in this series and loved each one of them. Bianca D'Arc knows how to make her stories not only hot but they always have a great story line. If you love this series you need to read her dragon series starting with ice dragon it will blow you away.,1
"After spending most of my time reading zombie books, I decided to read this after it suggested to me by a friend. At first it was very slow going but many books are. I did suffer from some confusion about what happened at the beginning causing the downfall of so much. The survival and the aiding of victims really got me going though. I love hearing about people getting together to help those not only survive but to live. So many people are victims but this story showed how they were given a chance to live and defend themselves. Having 3 different groups finally meeting up at the end was another aspect I loved. I am now looking forward to reading more of the Peacekeepers.",1
"Oh so sexy a read, quite explicit scenes of sex.  What a romance too, finding their long lost love affair. I really enjoyed it.",1
I fell in love with this series when I read the first one. I've got all in the series and I'm waiting for the next with baited breath!,1
"Fortune's Promise is the second story in the Fortune series, but it definitely wasn't my favourite (no need to read them in order, they are stand alone stories). I say that because I'm not really a fan of the ""famous person"" fantasy so I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the other two stories. Maddie, awestruck and helpless, falls under superstar Tanner's emotional and sensual spell...blah blah blah. Flying her out to see him? Buying her jewellery? At that point I stopped scrutinizing because there was no point.Putting aside my ever present pessimism, this book was pretty steamy and well written. Don't be swayed by me not liking the plot. I don't regret buying it, I rather like the way this author writes!Language: ExplicitLove Scenes: 5+Romance/Heat Factor Between Two Main Characters: Pretty hot, they're totally gaga for each other, as per the normOverall Rating: 3.5 Stars (Just because of the plot)",1
"**May contain what could be considered slight spoilers if you haven't read earlier books in the series**This is a really good story that gives two of the characters from earlier books in the series their happy endings.Jeremy (a policeman) and David (owner of a construction company) have a one-night stand, although both develop instant feelings for each other. When David is shot at, Jeremy needs to step up and help find out what is going on. Nice blend of mystery, romance, sex and drama.I liked that we knew something about both Jeremy and David from the earlier books. I had especially loved Jeremy in ""A Helping Hand"" where he was the love interest of one of the characters and a really nice guy but missed out on getting his man! Good to see he was the winner this time around!",1
"Overall it was a good story. What makes this genre the ultimate in horror is how fast & easy the plot could, and perhaps has, played out in the mundane world.What bothered me about this book was the vagueness that the reader is left to interpret and struggle through at times. But more than that were the loose ends left dangling... Who was Yencha and what did he really want? Why was the first doctor killed? What happened to the redneck thugs in Austen? Who were Danny's people? And most of all, where did Vroden go? Did he get lost? Fall in a mine shaft never to be heard from again? Run over by a train? I like cliff hangers, but this was ridiculous.(terribly sorry about any typos, that's what you get typing on a kindle at 4 am)",0
"I effing hated this book! The characters are so juvenile and immature. The only reason I forced myself to continue reading this whole joke--which only fueled my anger--was because I had hoped they would grow and mature. Their issues, especially the heroines, are petty and insignificant like those of a tween with her first zit and equating it to the end of the universe.The writing was okay, but dialog was pretty crappy. Fraught with too many Uh's and Um's for my taste... kind of like that of a child who's vocabulary hasn't been expanded on by education yet. Editing is excellent! It's odd... great books are always poorly edited and poor books are always superbly edited in my experience. Oh well. Unless you like to read YA's with child-like characters, I do NOT recommend this book. I certainly won't be reading the other books in the series because, judging by the other characters in this one, they're all of questionable maturity as well. Except Will...maybe. But that's a chance I'm not willing (heh) to take. Thank goodness this was free and I only wasted a few days!",0
I have never seen the movie (was there a movie?).  This book REALLY stirs your emotions.  (Sometimes you wish you could go back there and kick some of those bleeps bleeps!)  It is an excellent story! Excellent!,1
I loved this book!  Well written and great character development.  I was emotionally invested in them all and I loved how the boys went after what they  wanted.  The journey was well worth it!  Highly recommend this book and author.,1
"I am a Joe Hill fan since reading his work the first time. He doesn't disappoint.My Father's Mask was a great read--and I love my Kindle as well!!This story is also part of the 20TH Century Ghost book--also a GREAT read.I recommend these to anyone who enjoys authors such as Deaver,Koontz and Kellerman...oh yeah, and King.You should set aside plenty of time because you won't want to put these books down.",1
Too hard to get into the story...  Too many run-on sentences / thoughts...  I got bored with the character intros in the very 1st story and just deleted it off my Kindle.,0
"The story is very sweet and old fashioned; obviously written during another age.  It's a shame the book is so full of misspellings, misprints, and superfluous punctuation.  I don't think GLH wrote it that way.  Whoever transcribed it did a terrible job.",0
"Sanctuary's Price is the third book in Moira Rogers' Red Rock Pass Series. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in this series and this book did not disappointDylan Gennaro is a werewolf who's been alone for most of the last 10 years. He knows from previous experience that getting involved with anyone only leads to them getting hurt, literally. After a desperate escape from Alan Matthews, his former ruthless pack Alpha, Dylan just wants to fix up a house and live peacefully in Red Rock.Sasha Wallace is a witch. Her mentor was killed by Matthews because Matthews wanted Sasha for himself. Before she was rescued however, Matthews inflicted scars both physical and mental, and those take a long time to heal. Sasha knows things could have been much worse and feels she owes a debt to the Red Rock Pack for rescuing her.When a werewolf comes back into town showing evidence of a vampire attack, the Red Rock Alpha decides to send Dylan and Sasha to Maine to call in a debt from a friend - a vampire friend. While Dylan and Sasha meet with the vampire, their pack-mates, Joe and Brynn, are tasked with checking out the local werewolf pack, as there have been hints of trouble. Little do they know what kind of trouble is waiting for them. I liked the fact that we get to see how Brynn is progressing since the end of Sanctuary Lost. Her situation was fascinating and heartbreaking at the same time.Dylan and Sasha' story was sweet and sexy. They both had issues to work through as a result of being under Alan Matthew's ""rule"" and I like that Moira Rogers didn't sugarcoat their issues and go straight to a HEA. Their insecurities were realistic and the potential conflicts resulting from their issues made for believable characters. Dylan is not Alpha but his werewolf instincts were very, very sexy. When Dylan tells Sasha, ""I'm not like the alphas. I don't want your submission. I just want your pleasure."", I almost melted. The sexual tension between these two left burn marks on my kindle!In this story we also meet a certain flannel-wearing lumberjack vampire who's apparently got an interesting history; I believe we'll see more of him in the next book, Sanctuary Unbound. I give Sanctuary's Price 4/5 stars!",1
"I read this one and thought it was good, not as funny as some in her Halle seriesThe Wallflower: A Hunting Love story, Halle Puma Series Book 1.,Steel Beauty: Halle Pumas, Book 4orBear Necessities: Halle Shifters, Book 1, but I wanted to re-read it so I could readEye of the Beholder: True Destiny, Book 2.On completing that, I thought it was better than good. It wasn't excellent, but Jordan was a good character, eventually I thought Kir and Logan were ok too. I thought the use of different Norse gods was great!I've purchased everything Ms. Bell has written so far and I enjoy all her works.",1
"If you like this sort of genre, it's probably a good book, but I couldn't get into it, flying from one country to another and one character to another...I'm old and had a hard time keeping it all straight...lol.  Just not my thing.",0

"Jessie Warner couldn't accept that her husband Tommy's death was an accident.  It had been seven months since his untimely death, and the answers everyone provided didn't make sense to her.  There was something wrong with the circumstances surrounding his death, and she wasn't going to give up until she knew the truth.  She was miserable, and had pulled away from everyone she was close to with the exception of her best childhood friend Todd.  He wouldn't let her, and practically had to force her to get out and live again.  He dragged her to a party where he promised she wouldn't have to worry about any male attention because it was known among friends as Gay Fest.  Jess let herself go there, and actually found herself having a good time with the only straight man at the party, Caleb James.Jess found herself caring more than she thought possible for Caleb, but she couldn't let Tommy's death go unavenged.  She owed his memory closure.  When the past threatened her future, she wasn't sure she would have the opportunity to find out what was possible with Caleb.This was tragic heart wrenching story with love, laughter, and passion.  Jessie had to deal with more heartache than she was capable of carrying alone.  Caleb was exactly the person she needed in her life.  He provided the love and stability she was so desperately missing.  A good balanced story that will have an impact!!",1
Not only the premise is unreal.  The characters are superficial and hard to care about.,0
"Two best friends growing up, experiment with each other, fall in love, go into military, then move back home.  They go and rescue the girl of their dreams from a psyco father and then all fall in love.  We meet the fabulous Navy seals and thus starts the great series.  You will not be disappointed with this series..",1
"As most of the detractors admit, the quality and depth of their articles is first class.  I also prefer a weekly magazine to a daily paper: more depth, and less time I need to spend to keep up with the news.Time and Newsweek really don't make it.  They could be $0.00 and they still wouldn't be worth my attention.Sure, I'm a bit chafed that Amazon and the Economist pocketed all the cost savings of the Kindle edition and didn't pass any of it to me.  So I'm not very loyal and I'm open to competitors.  But for now, the $10/month Kindle edition does everything I need, and I'm willing to pay that price for it.",1
"I did'nt enjoy it,  I really was a teenage book and I found it silly and boring, not my type of book",0
"If you're looking for escapist reading, this book has the following problems:1  The hero is really repellent.  Even after he falls in love with the heroine, he is unchanged.  He's morally degenerate and causes no end of difficulty for good characters.  He doesn't accept the word no even when the heroine clearly means it.2.  A beloved character is murdered, when up to then the reader is expecting that she might well have a following book of her own.  This makes the rest of the book depressing.  There are clearly ways the author could have achieved her aim without this.",0
"This is book was just about a perfect read! Yes there were a few editing issues with this particular copy, but the product description clearly states that the book is a reproduction of a book published before 1923 and may have occasional imperfections, such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc. In light of this proclamation, it amazed my that so many reviewers still took the time to complain about the typos.  They were present but did not in the least distract from the story, at least for me they did not.  Furthermore, I could not in any way tell that this book had been scanned.Phoebe Deane is an orphan who as a child went to live with her half brother, Albert Deane.  Albert is a mild mannered, kindly man who sees only the good in everyone.  He is also a bit of a dolt.  His wife Emmeline is the evil stepmother type from Cinderella.  She works Phoebe to death and never has a kind word for the girl.  She is also crass with very little education.  Truthfully, she is just plain jealous of the beautiful, refined Phoebe.  Hiram Green, a neighbor of the Deanes' wants to marry Phoebe, but she despises the very sight of him!  The hero, Nathaniel, is a lawyer and the nephew of Judge Bristol, one of town's most prominent members.  Nathaniel lives and works in New York City, but often visits with his uncle who helped to raise him.  The book is set in a small town in New York State some time in the 1830's.  Nathaniel meets Phoebe when he comes upon her in the woods where she is crying after having read a letter from her deceased mother.  Nathaniel is immediately taken with the beautiful, soft spoken Phoebe.  I loved Nate and Phoebe, but if I had to pick a favorite character it would be Miranda, Phoebe's friend and self appointed guardian angel.  Hiram is determined to marry Phoebe and refuses to accept her rejection of his proposal.  He and Emmeline conspire to get Phoebe to accept him as a husband and he literally begins to stalk the poor girl!  Everytime Phoebe left her house, Hiram would be there with his unwelcome presence.  Hiram took note of Nathaniel's attentions towards Phoebe and between that and her constant rejection of his suit he begins to hate her and Nathaniel and starts scheming against them.  All the while he is still determined to have Phoebe as his wife.  If not for the enterprising Miranda, he might very well have succeeded in his evil plot.  Other characters include Marcia and her husband David Spafford, the hero and heroine from the first book of the Schuyler trilogy entitled ""Marcia Schuyler.""  I have not as yet read that book, but have just been lucky enough to obtain a free copy and so intend to read that next.  I am also looking forward the 3rd and final book in the triology ""Miranda"" in which the beloved Miranda finally gets her love match.  This book invoked a wide range of real emotions in me.  I  lauged out loud at many of Miranda's escapades, I literally felt Phobe's pain and suffering, and I completely despised Hiram Green.  One scene in particular where he and Emmeline conspire to get Phoebe to travel alone with Hiram had me clenching my teeth and wishing I was there to kick Hiram's sorry ass!!!!  He gets his in the end though and very nicely too, thanks in part to Miranda, of course!  Love that girl! And of course, love conquers all when Nate and Phoebe get to sail off into the sunset to begin their happily ever after.  I highly, highly recommend this book.  Jane Austen lovers especially will love this book.  It is a nice clean truly romantic story that touched me deeply.",1
"This book was poor and I asked myself why? I got no answer. No I didn't like it at all, rather boring.",0
I just could not finish this book. In fact I read about 10% of the book abd got so creeped out that I had to stop. Perhaps the out of body experience would have been interesting but when I started to read about the murderers I just got the chills and had to stop reading. This was just awful!,0
The book is well written and very well could have been just like history. Who knows for sure? Worth the money and time.,1
Love books that combine a bit of history and a glimpse of another culture with the elements of mystery.  Would buy another book by this author.,1
"Things were going well for Scarlett. She met the devastatingly handsome Alessandro and had a blistering hot relationship with him... until she became pregnant. But little did she know that instead of the happy reaction she expected, he became incensed, called her a liar and threw her out on the street in the middle of the night. 3 years later, Alessandro is back, but for business reasons - Scarlett has become a skilful interior decorator which he wishes to engage to refurbish his new property. In her close proximity with Alessandro, should she push for a relationship between Alessandro and his son? or just leave it be as if Alessandro realised the truth, he might take her son away from her forever...The gift of this author is that she makes the male leads more reasonable and their actions more understandable. The reasons for Alessandro's rejection of Scarlett's pregnancy proclaimation is, while harsh, yet understandable when you realise the reasons behind it. (As opposed to other male leads in other books which makes you feel like smacking them for being such arrogant pigs and you can't understand the double standards or irrationality of it all.)Perhaps I'm spoilt by her other books (One Last Night (Harlequin Presents), but i felt that this book was alright. It was not bad. But not good either. The ending was alright. It was alright. A good alternative is to read One last night instead which I felt had a more unique plot.",0
"Ty Johnston has created a character in Kron Darkbow that reminds me a little bit of The Punisher.  His family was killed and he is going to get revenge no matter what it takes.  When he finds the wizard responsible for the actual killings he finds out that the order came from another.  He switches his target immediately not caring that he is now taking on arguably the most powerful man in the city.As other reviewers have stated this book really does not leave you guessing at what is going to happen, but it does its job very well.  The scenery is described with enough detail that you know what the environment looks like, but it does not bog the story down.  Action is the number one thing in this book and there is plenty of it: chases, narrow escapes, assassins, sword fights, magic, torture, etc...The second book promises a much bigger bad guy to take down and a few new friends to help out.  I will be picking it up in the near future for sure.",1
"Very interesting ideas. Shades of Soylent Green, one of my favorites. The book forces one to think about both sides of an issue we all think about uncomfortably. I personally thought the ending was great!",1
Vaughan has written a great story about sheep and cattle on open range and the problems that comes with gready cow ranchers not wanting sheep on the range. The series of Hawke is a great  read.,1
This book was slow to start.  Once it got going was good.  I would recommend this book to anyone to read.,1
"At times this was a really good story, at others it wasn't. But it sure was a worthwhile book, nevertheless.Sandra Mercer was surprised to find her daughter Carla wearing a letter sweater that Sandra knew belonged to the boy she'd once planned to marry, 30 years ago.  Carla's new boyfriend, Kevin, was the nephew of that man, Jack Dawson - and Jack had just moved back to town!  As the story continued, the things that had happened over those thirty years to both people, the reasons why things had happened as they did, all were made known.  Also, that Jack and Sandra still loved one another - but after all that time, it may not be possible to be together.  Especially because of a sailboat race, something Jack wanted to take part in, that turns so deadly that Jack and the crew may never return.",1
"Bad things exist in life, let's all cry.wahh ................................................. feel better? What you liked it? Oh well read this book.",0
"I did not like the book, mainly because I hated the heroin. She is the quintessential bimbo. For example, driving to pick her boyfriend Zayne, whose life is in dire danger from a tornado, she still has time to remark : *Her boots looked much better against monster truck floorboards than against her sedan's plush, lamb's wool mat. Maybe she should sell the Mercedes*(location 3614-20).Not only is she so superficial she defines the word, she is also very ungrateful. All her life, she has been clothed (munificently), fed, cared for and educated by her parents. When she decides to move out, at 35 years-old !!!, they even buy and furnish an apartment for her. She should be thankful but instead, whines that they did not love her and cared for her as they should have (apparently, they were cold and otherwise occupied).The rest of the plot is unimaginative and could not rescue the story from the fallings of its main character.",0
"Charli signs up for what she thinks is an extreme scavenger hunt/challenge with her best friends Simon, Eric, & Rafael, while they are on a cruise celebrating the wedding of another close friend Lee.  They quickly find out that they have been duped by well meaning friends and enrolled into an extreme erotic race.  With a huge bet hanging in the balance they decide to brave the adventure together.Stumbled onto this book and I liked it a lot, but it feels like a book two, but it's a stand alone.  Lee and his two girls' story doesn't exist yet, but hope springs eternal and I will keep an eye out to read it when it does.  Fast paced and a little short.  I would have like to know more of their background.",1
"I've read Readers Digest for years and love it. Thought getting it on my Kindle would be great.Not so much! Compare the Kindle version as plain white rice to a full course meal. Wasn't hardly anything I liked about it. I think the table of contents should be laid out differently. Didn't like it at all. Listed the main component and you had to click and click to find what you want to read. Would have been much better to show the main catagory then physically print the subtitles underneath it as links. That way you could actually quickly ""see"" the article you'd like to read.  I thought the content was poor at best. Seemed like there wasn't much to the ""magazine"". Short articles and not very interestng articles. Loss of the picture content and short anedotes between the stories left me feeling very disappointed. I think Readers Digest needs to do much better. Especially since there are a lot of magazines going out of business due to the evolution of the internet and applications such as ereaders. The only think I did like about the e-version  was the absence of those pesky ads. I'm glad I only bought the single current issue. Come on RD....you can do much better!",0
"I think I enjoyed Amber Eyes a little more than Golden Eyes, and I thoroughly enjoyed that novella. Kaya was enjoyable to read and watch come to get use to the human world she had long since stopped from trying to enter. Also for Hunter and Jericho to learn to love again.",1
"Interesting book.  If one is really into the stories behind the outlaws of the American West this book covers a lot.  I was bored at times.  The author did his homework though, kuddos to that.",0
"This one actually just left me saying Eeeew[...]  I didnt find it the least bit entertaining, the characters were flat and just seemed to be there so that the author had an excuse to write about sex.  there was no chemistry, no build up. This book was an unsatisfying quicky.",0
"Just got my Kindle for Christmas and was looking for a few free books to download and learn to use my Kindle.  Well, let me tell you, I was so pleased with this short book.  I read mostly true crime and autobiography's.  Eventhough this was not a true crime, the reviews got me to try it, plus there was nothing to lose, it was FREE.The book is very suspenseful and graphic.  (If you get quezzy easily, skip it.)I have to admit, I wanted the book to end a certain way, and I was not disappointed.As I titled my review, Justice Served.  (You will smile at the ending)  Also, these authors have several others here on Amazon, I have downloaded most of them and have not been let down yet.It is a short read and worth every second.  Download and enjoy, I did.Happy Reading, Ms. Jackie",1
"I really enjoyed this short romance.Ainsley was running after her ex boyfriend attacked her. She knew she needed a place to stay to get out of the storm so she found a house that she thought was abandoned. She quickly found out the house belonged Braedan that was serving time. Most people thought he was serving time for a crime he didn't commit. She wanted to be out of the house before he got out of jail.  He got out early, and came home to the smell of apple pie, and a beautiful lady in his kitchen. It was sweet at how fast the two fell in love with one another.Some of my best parts from the book:Sample from chapter 3 - As the water washed over her, she wondered how she'd gotten herself into this mess. She was engaged to an ex-con, a man she'd never met before last night: she was on the run for murder and she was absolutely terrified.Sample from chapter 4""You would have been better off if I hadn't come here."" He put his fork down and turned her to face him. ""Don't ever think that. You took my house and made it into a home, Ainsley. I'd come back thinking I was going to walk into a house that was falling down. Instead I was welcomed by the smell of apple pie and the most delectable woman on earth in my kitchen.""",1
"The author clearly wanted to push this series forward, introduce dome things. But this is part of a story, bit a whole one, and I wouldn't gave bought this if I'd known. This should have been a free read in a newsletter.",0
"I'm only reviewing this book, more accurately a story, to counter the overly positive ones it has received.  Otherwise I wouldn't even go to the trouble. I bought this because the plot seemed interesting--ancient vampire who has been disturbed by a young woman buying and moving in the old farmhouse over his lair.  It had promise--promise that the author couldn't fulfill.The book was written as if the author had a formula to write by: Introduce main characters, immediately have them have dream sex, then have male lead tell her that she is his one, and BTW he's a vampire and then have sex for the rest of the story.  No building up of the plot or tension between characters which lead to any type of climax (non-sexual type) and resolution.  The only vaguely dramatic scene happens off the pages--we see right before and after.  At least I know not to buy any more of her books.",0
This was a free read by the author & Amazon. This was as good her other book (perfect proposal) but longer.,1
I actually read all of this. I can't believe I did. Its so sexist and just awful. I don't know what possessed me to keep reading it. No likable characters. Maybe you have to be a southerner and I'm a Yankee.... I just disliked this immensely.,0
"Originally published in the magazine &#34;Astounding Science Fiction&#34; in 1938.Re-published in e-book format by Galaxy Press in 2010.On the internet you can find rumors that this was L. Ron Hubbard's first science fiction story. Purportedly, the editor was looking for something that was breezy, funny and easy-to-read. I have no idea if this really true, but this short story is certainly all of those things.Sadly, it's just not a very good short story.Dr. Henry Mudge has worked out the mathematics of how to transport oneself instantly from one place to another just by imagining that place. He calls this formula Equation C.But, controlling your mind enough to use this technique is difficult. Try not to think of a place when you hear someone talk about it. So, when someone says a place to Dr. Mudge he goes there, including the moon and Mars. Meanwhile, he is supposed to be giving a major presentation at his university to a group of professors if he can just get there and stay there without bouncing off somewhere else...While a cute concept, the story just does not work all that well if you think it through. The internal consistency is just not there. Also, despite the fact that the cover has an exploding space ship on it, there are no space ships in this short story.The story is accompanied by an uncritical, enthusiastic biography of Hubbard that mostly skips over the Scientology stuff.",0
"This is my second book of hers, and I have to admit I'm still getting used to the idea of a menage, but Annmarie does them very well. The emotion was very well done. A very emotional, gripping read. The heroine was extremely realistic and the abuse aspect was handled exceptionally well. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I've just become a fan. Going to have to go through her backlist now.",1
"THE STORY LINE WAS VERY GOOD BUT, WAY TO MUCH EXPLANATION OF LAND MINES AND IINFO THAT DID NOT NEED TO BE THERE WHEN THE BOOK WAS EXCITING IT WAS VERY GOOD BUT, I ENDED UP SKIMMING ALMOST ALL OF THE REST",0
"I've read several of Glenn's books over several series. Before reading this volume, I had read every other volume of this series (except the newest 1, vol. 7; it had not been published when I finished reading the other 5). I had not read this one, because I didn't think the books needed to be read in sequence and the summary for this one just didn't interest me enough to want to read it. Since I thought 7 costs more than what I wanted to pay, and I'd been waiting for several months, a year at least I think, for her to finish the series, because vol. 6 actually ended with a cliff hanger - I decided to just go ahead and read this volume for the sake of completion, in the mean time while waiting for the price of vol. 7 to lower, if it lowers.Well after reading vol. 1, I wish that I hadn't, but I'd been curious about how Jake and Lucas got together with Leyland, because all the others manage to refer to their relationship and the 'incident' that they had with Leyland where he almost died, at least once. Since the first vol. of the series, that I did read, explained the issue with the tri-omegas having to find their 2nd mate, once they found the first, I could deduce why or how it was the Leyland nearly died from being grounded to his room for several days. Therefore, I didn't think that the actual circumstances that led to the grounding, but just what nearly happened as a result of the grounding, was pertinent to the plots of the other volumes. In conclusion, I didn't need to read it to fully understand any of the vols. that I did read, if I didn't want to.I tried to like Secret Desires, after one read, but I just couldn't, not enough to want to keep it or suggest it to anyone else. I liked it from the very beginning, when no one other than Leyland had been introduced. I found it amusing, but then Jake was introduced, but not Lucas. And I started to wonder why Jake greeted Leyland alone without Lucas. I knew that Jake and Lucas had been together 10 years for the summary. I assumed that the summary meant mated. It didn't. And when I figured that out, I got rather disappointed with the story. I couldn't understand how Jake and Lucas after being in love with and sleeping with one another and sharing a bedroom for TEN YEARS, didn't realize that one another was mates, despite the fact that they really, really didn't believe two men could be mated, if after seeing - not touching or actually meeting - but just seeing Leyland ONCE, only once, Jake knew without a doubt that Leyland was definitely his mate, since Leyland was ALSO A MAN. I'm not sure how the author didn't see that glaring contradiction in her own work. A good friend of mine, suggested that it's probably due to not having an editor, because that's the sort of things editors catch and bring to the author's attention, before she publishes a work.The three of them Jake, Luc and Ley got things sorted rather quickly and that was good.The gaping contradiction, was just too hard for me to ignore, and that's the not so good part. Now if you have read any of the others, like vol. 2 and 3 which have the same contradiction and 4, which is the exact opposite, where the two regular wolves are mated before they meet the tri-omega and then one of them recognized the tri-omega as his mate upon the first time he met him, but the other didn't. (The 2nd one was drunk, and furious due to major jealously at the time, plus tired and sleepy, so maybe that was his excuse. Can't say, because the author never explains.) I was able to let it slide in the 2 and 3, because, in those cases, the tri-omegas 2 mates had not met and been involved before meeting him. Instead, one met the tri-omega first and got involved and then the two of them both met the third and pretty much the same time and together. So it was easier to ignore.I just couldn't get over how Jake could drop the love of his life for 10 years, for someone he'd never actually met, and then have sex with the guy - Leyland - on the way back to the house that he shared with said long-time lover. Really?!! And then when Jake and Leyland get to the house, and Lucas realizes that Leyland is his mate too, Jake immediately doesn't want to share. So first, he breaks up with Lucas, taking himself as a lover from Luc and two, when he learns that Luc actually has a fated mate, same as he does, because it just happens to be his also, he doesn't want Luc to claim the guy right away, like he just did, until HE can figure things out. So while Jake has everything including something he's always dreamed of, but never thought would happen - his fated mate,Leyland, plus Luc pining over him, poor Luc, on the other hand, has NO ONE and nothing, just immense, nearly unbearable pain and suffering, while 'Jake' figures things out. And to add insult to injury, Jake gets to have his mate 'while' he figures thing out and Luc gets to live in the same house and watch and listen to the man that he loves 'and' his mate, be with one another while he's alone and can't be with either, nor even claim his mate, Leyland, whom he has just as much right to as Jake dose - while 'Jake' figures things out.  I liked Jake; he seemed to be a good guy for the most part, but I thought in his excitement of having a mate and his rush to claim him, Jake's behavior toward Luc, the man he'd loved for 10 years, was greedy, selfish and insensitive. I don't think finding his fated mate, was a good enough reason for him to just go off and claim the guy in the way that he did, with the sex, before giving poor Luc any chance to even try to adjust. Haven't they heard of dating!! He could have just tried to get to know Leyland first, for awhile without him even being at the house or living there at least, without claiming him, while giving Luc some time to try and wrap his mind around the whole thing. But no, after only being broke up for only a few weeks, not even a month, he moves another man - fated mate or not - into the room that he had shared with Luc while Luc is still living in the same house! Really?! That was awful!!!! In my opinion it was. Fate or not, there is a right way and a wrong way to do a thing. And that was not right way. To me the author comes across saying that their love for anyone else, means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, when compared to being with their fated mate. Yes, everything worked out in the end, but neither Jake and especially not Luc knew that.Jake gets his mate, great and wonderful, and Luc just gets shafted and not in the good way. And Jake couldn't find a way to be more sensitive about it. I don't see that a fated mate allows them to just disregard someone that hey are currently involved with.I had wondered what one of them, a shifter, would do in a situation like that where, he/she met their mate, but was already in loving monogomous relationship with someone, that he/she had been with for a long time, at the time.  When I finally read an example, though, - I really didn't like it! Well sometimes, that's how it is.Yeah, I know it's fantasy, but I take love very seriously. So I don't like it, when a character in a story, is supposed to be the good-guy or the protagonist, and just treats someone they love horribly for any reason, other than to save a person's life or to like save the world (family, town, country, universe, space and time and we know it) or something of that nature.",0
"Three college friends tackle the adult world. MJ pursues a graduate degree at an unnamed British university and finds herself pursued by several men; Claudia follows her boyfriend to his new job in the Midwest and tries to make it as a writer; Sophie hates her advertising dream job and finds a new and unexpected career.I borrowed this book from another Kindle owner through the Lendle.me website. The three separate storylines are confusing at times, and it's just unbelievable that all three young women have men dripping off them. But many of the problems they face are similar to problems that my own twenty-something children are facing, so I didn't have any problem believing the rest of the book, and the stories kept me reading. Kindle formatting was okay. The book title was okay although not uniquely appropriate.",1
"I was so loving this book, but 41 pages left it unended. If this happens often I will be reluctant to order more",0
"The entire time I read this I just wanted to go ick...This book is presented pretty much as a Romance and I just don't like adultery in my Romance. Personally I did not like any of the characters and the ""good"" wife sure shucked her pantaloons quick for a guy with a pretty face and good manners. Perhaps if the author had given the romance portion time to develop slowly instead of the ""oops I couldn't control myself"", I might have been able to enjoy the story more.  Unfortunately, the author kept presenting the wife and lover as people of honour and the husband as a monster and while I believe she did the latter she failed miserably in the former. I also felt as if the ending was a cheat, I knew it was coming but I kept hoping that she would be a little more original.  I am not one of those people who expect the lovers to be virgins or even requiring the lovers to be limited to two of the opposite gender, however I do not like liars and sneaks and that is what this book is full of.",0
"It is a great pleasure to be reading The New Yorker on a weekly basis, having it always on demand and not having to fumble around with a paper magazine is great. I have been an occasional The New Yorker reader since 1989 but only in hardcopy and never a subscriber, living the past 3 years in Switzerland I told my wife, once we lived in the US again I would get a subscription.It is strange to read reviews damming kindle for charging Usd 6 (in round numbers) monthly for the magazine, since they can have it in hardcopy for less.Well I am sorry the quality writing for 6 bucks a month and delivered seamlessly through the air, what is there not to like? I would have no issue paying Usd 7 weekly for the magazine that would be one dollar a day.Kindle rocks, and we should all be willing to pay for quality. That will ensure that the quality is not diluted, and that we can continue to get quality.",1
"The story is nice, maybe a little too short, only 52 pages.It's a revisiting of The Wizard of Oz story, with Dorothy who here is named Kansas (like the United State) and it's not from Kansas, but from Iowa. Kansas is a independent wealthy man who decided to live like an hermit in his family land. When he is swept away from a tornado, no one notices his absence, and so Kansas is free to enjoy is adventure.He awakes in a strange world, inhabited by half-man half-beast being; the first two he meets are a cat like man and a bird like woman, a strange couple indeed. When the two find this strange being with bare skin and blue eyes, they think that it would be a nice gift for their king and decide to bring Kansas to him, even if the cat-like man would like to have a taste. In this world sensuality is the normal behavior and sex is almost a recreational activity; Kansas will discover that even a simple bath in a pond has sexual consequences, and not thanks to another being, but since the waters are alive.When Kansas arrives to the king's palace, the first human-like man he meets is Z, a wizard. He is almost ""normal"" if not for the fact that he is extremely handsome and gold colored. Z. tells Kansas that, if he wants to have the chance to go back to home, he should refuse the king... and here maybe The Wizard of Oz mixed with One Thousand and One Nights. And here maybe is where I'd like the story to be a bit longer: there is an acceleration that brings the reader to the end of the story when it would be interesting to have more; the relationship between the King and Kansas is only hinted, and almost chaste in comparison to all the other sexual experiences Kansas had before ""consorting"" with the King.Naughty thought on the title: Not in Kansas means that the story is not setting in Kansas like The Wizard of Oz, or that the King is not allowed to ""enter"" Kansas (and I don't mean the State...)Anyway as I said the story is nice and enjoyable, more funny than serious; this is not the classical fantasy tale heavy in details, but it's more a funny escapade in a world that maybe is the dream world in Kansas' mind.",1
"This book had adventure, romance, the supernatural, and sex.  This book containssexual scenes so adults 18+ please.  I liked the characters Leo Dunne and RubyHalloway and how they interact.  However they moved a bit fast (but Leo has beenwaiting a long time for Ruby) and she has a lot to drink it about his family,especially the feud between the Dunnes and Malmaynes who want Leo and Kaitlynn,the Malmayne daughter to marry instead.  Some of the other characters whereinteresting as well like Leo's other siblings and Robin Goodfellow.  Howeversome of the sex scenes were intense and some readers may not like them.  ButI am interested in the other books in the Gray Court series.  Worth a read.",1
"Accidentally, I ordered a Kindle version of the book.  Either the author or Amazon Kindle has dropped the last 4 chapters in the kindle verson.  This was a good book.  M. L. Rhodes, in the beginning, wrote some excellent novels, then she switched to, my personal opinion,  the ""crank out mode,"" probably due to greed, shortened her books, raised her prices.  I now refuse to read anything with her name as author.",0
I hadn't read this series before and was surprised how nice it is. It made me laugh but it made me wish also that these types of men existed. It was hard to put down.,1
"Jeff Inlo writes books that deal with the bigger issues of life. There is no unnecessary violence or sexual innuendo that the reader has to deal with yet our heroes deal with hatred, those seeking power for their own ends, revenge and forgiveness. For those wishing to read a book with a simple message in a fantasy setting, this is it.",1
I fell in love with the show and thought I would read the stories themself. Thease stories are so twisted. But a fantastic read.,1
"This was a great love story. It shows that love has no age limit and can not be bound to money, up bringing, or other peoples beliefs on what defines love. This was good to the last page. I really hope to read move about this family in the future.",1
"OK I was prepared for ""chick lit"" and ready for it to be just another dumb romance, but the treatment of characters and the things they did etc was especially shallow. What I cannot forgive, however, is the misuse of words in a book!!!  Writers need to do more than use spellcheck to find those--they need to actually READ THE BOOK.  They started showing up @ 75%, so for some reason the writer got in a hurry to finish this book. Perhaps they were sick of it too.unforgivable are:peace when it should be pieceshuttered when it should be shudderedsaver when it should be savorknow when it should be nowsummons when it should be summon...And I did not set out to look for errors, these just jumped off the page they were so bad...it disrupts the entire thought process when you run across stupid errors like these.I'm glad I did not pay for this book, as it wasn't worth any money. I will not read anything from this ""author"" again.In this day and age everyone seems to think they can write a book, but it is not that easy to write a GOOD book. I suggest this writer read some very good books to figure out why this stuff is just ""tripe"".  The author needs to take English 101.  The mistakes above are just unforgivable for anyone who purports to be a writer. A high school student could write something like this--and perhaps they did.",0
"Very Interesting. Looked at the situation from many different angles. Well written & would recommend to others. The author has a good writing technique, will read more by him.",1
"Atticus has walked the earth for a millennium and for so long he has searched for his One, the one woman in all the world meant to be his other half. Now, after having resigned himself to not finding her, after debating the final sleep and turning further and further away from existence, he steps on a girls toes and his entire world changes.Lissa was feeling apprehensive about taking the shuttle bus up the mountain, but she got on anyway. Slightly psychic, she's feeling very uneasy until she sees a man who literally robs her of breath and makes her heart race. Suddenly those psychic warnings are blaring conflicting messages and when he trods on her toes and looks into her eyes, Lissa knows she'll remember that fantastic stranger for the rest of her days.A tragedy leads them to each other and dedication to each other will see them through to eternity.It's not the premise to this short novella that I have a problem with. It's perhaps not the most original of stories, but it has a bunch of sexy male vampires in it, and that's pretty much all I need to enjoy a short story like this. Unfortunately, it was just about every other aspect of the story that made me wince.I think D'Arc had some sizzling sex scenes in the book that are deliciously graphic and temperature raising, but that's where the good points end. The dialogue is so unbelievable, so cliched and trite and way beyond soap opera-ish that it actually hurt to read some of it. I totally don't get it. I've read D'Arc before and didn't have that problem with the book, but this one was quite literally painful.The development (and I use the term loosely) of the relationship between Atticus and Lissa was nearly comical in its speed and lack of anything resembling realism, and the 'conflict' of the story arc was...just bizarre. If that wasn't bad enough, it ends with a cliffhanger, and I have a huge issue with cliffhangers. They're in my top three of reading anathemas. At this point not even a life threatening cliffhanger could prompt me to continue with this series, though I did like the interaction between Atticus' friend Marc and Lissa's friend Kelly. I just don't know if I would risk dialogue as horrible as it was here.Originally reviewed on One Good Book Deserves Another.",0

"This Is The Worse Book I Have Ever Read!!!! Oh my goodness, who edited this garbage? Ms. McCray please don't write anymore books. What an awful story! What an awful end! BLECH!",0
"This book has a few things going for it. Some originality in the Passion Fish part of the story and some witty banter. The other parts are pretty formulaic and predictable, although that never stops me from reading it! I like how LONG the book was. It took some time to get through and that's a good thing as far as I'm concerned. I really liked all the characters!",0
The book was very good just not long enough. Love her books and have not read one I did not like.,1
"Cat's Paw was one of those surprisingly happy finds one makes from time to time. Ms. Taylor put together a wonderful story that keeps you glued to the pages. This is an action/adventure book written from a feminine perspective, and is very well done. It is also more than action/adventure and really defies placing it in any particular genre. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature.",1

"This sequel to ""Hiding the Elephant"" is in desperate need of an editor. The  number of grammatical/spelling errors, typos and plain old misuse of words was abysmal.The story wanders all over the place with characters popping up, disappearing and then reappearing much later.Thank heavens for the ""search"" feature.I don't have any idea if the author ever reads these critiques, but if so I would chastise her for letting errors such as the following ever make it into print:Whishing for wishing (three times!), style for stile, flack for flak, neigh for nigh, dogged for dodging bullets, "" hey-fever,"" pluming for plumbing, desert for dessert, a smooth loan for lawn, loped for lopped, looser for loser, ""chentrelle, cep and morelle""  for chanterelles, cepes and morels, ad infinitum...truly depressing that such a poorly edited book would ever make it into the market.The story itself has so many branches that the reader gets lost or ends up not really caring who did it. The infidelity theme carried over from the first book did almost nothing to further the story line.For the sake of literate readers of murder mysteries, please, please do not subject us further to this kind of horribly edited verbiage..",0
"This Kindle book is a single short story by L. Ron Hubbard, together with a long essay praising Hubbard as a master of the pulp fiction era. Hubbard did write some classic pulp-- ""Fear"" is one of the greatest horror stories of all time, and ""Typewriter in the Sky"" is a wonderful piece of fantasy-- but this is one of his weaker efforts, a one-joke piece of science fiction humor.",0
"Truck Stop is an exclusive ebook on Kindle by Jack Kilborn and J.A. Konrath. You may not know this unless your an avid fan but Kilborn and Konrath are one in the same.It brings 3 characters together from 3 different books. Donaldson (Serial), Taylor (Afraid), and Lieutenant Jack Daniels (from the Jack Daniels series). Two serial killers and a cop come face to face in a Truck Stop. Never having met before they happen upon each other while chatting it up Jack (obviously having really bad luck with serial killers) happens to walk into the same Truck Stop. Donaldson recognizes her and immediately wants her for his collection. Taylor and Donaldson fight over who actually wins before settling on coin toss.It's all very fast paced and exciting. I really enjoyed reading all three of these characters together. I love these little short stories.",1
"Some of the story seems a bit over the top and fanciful, but i find that to be true with most of Anderson's stories. However, it doesn't detract from how good the story is, nor how well it's written. Great discovery story.",1
So basically this book is about a girl whose in to baseball players. She's with 4 of them throughout the whole book then suddenly picks one of the guys within the last 4 pages of the book.,0
This is the first book I have read by this lady. And it was very good.  I shall order another one soon.,1
I love Gena but didn't love this story. The whole curse thing never really got explained well or how it was broken. That or I was yawning when it happened. I'll stick to her Lords from now on I think.,0
I quit reading when I realized that this wasn't a full story in itself.  I have read series before that at least held their own story for that book and continued in others.  But I was half way through this book and quit.  I just found out the story line when I was half way through.  That doesn't bode well for the ending.  It will be a huge cliff hanger for sure and I don't go for that when reading.  At least it was free on Kindle since I would have to pay alot to continue the story if I chose to.,0
"Sheriff J. T. Summers knows he is a goner.  He knows this but does his best to ignore it.  Why? Because the one woman he wants and desires is the one woman he is not allowed to have - his best friend's much younger sister, Nikki Durant.Nikki has loved J. T. For what seems like forever.  Much to her consternation, J. T. resists her at every turn using her age as an excuse.  Almost desperate, Nikki is running out of options where J. T. is concerned.  She has one thing left up her sleeve to make J. T. admit his feelings for her.  If only he wasn't so stubborn.J. T. Summers had good intentions.  They were honorable and moralistic.  They were not realistic, especially where Nikki was concerned.  She loved J. T. and made no bones about it.  Convincing J. T. of this and that the age gap between them didn't matter, took a lot of effort but was well worth the end result.I really enjoyed seeing the characters of Brazen again.  Their friendship with J. T. and Nikki made for an amusing scene or two.  With Reckless, Maya Banks has penned a perfect story for these two lovers. It was a `forbidden love no longer denied' sort of novel and it was outstanding.  Of course, I had no doubts. After all, it was written by Maya Banks!Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"I couldn't find anything to like about this book.  I didn't like the characters and found the background story on the main characters wasn't developed enough for me to care.  I think the author did herself a disservice because this first novel felt very rushed and incomplete.  We were immediately thrown into the action with characters we had not yet had a chance to get to know and care about.  Then again, what was there to like about the ignorant, money-grubbing Daisy, cunning and crafty Aiden or Peter the Lunk Head?  I was appalled when Aiden admired Daisy's intelligence when she was going on about her business plan talking about ""those people"" (Koreans) so ignorantly I actually winced while reading.  She didn't sound smart; she sounded like a bigot and a hick and someone too young and experienced to have a clue about the world outside of Hollow Creek, KY...which I guess is what she was.  Aiden was so outrageously conniving it was almost comical.  All he needed was a long mustache to twist while laughing maniacally over Daisy tied to a railroad track and the image would have been complete.  Peter was such a chest-thumping, keep-the-woman-barefoot-and-pregnant caveman that the moments where he was supposed to be breaking down and showing his softer side almost didn't make sense.  Also, when Daisy's big (and obvious) secret was finally revealed in a dramatic (and predictable) fashion to Peter; I didn't feel sorry for either character.  I was actually very happy that this little bit of drama had finally come to its predictable conclusion.On a side note:  I found it extremely annoying that Daisy and Peter kept referring to Jessiemae but we never met her.  Here was a character that sounded like she might have a little bit of complexity and she never makes an appearance in the story!!Anyway, I downloaded the second novel, Daisy's Choice, right after completing this bit of fluff and it immediately became apparent that the author tried to make up for what was lacking in the first novel by giving more background on these characters.  But at this point, I find these characters so revolting and unendearing that I no longer care to see them get to, what I suspect, is just another predictable happily ever after.  I returned the second novel and am certian I won't ever reread Aiden's Game.  This is not to say that I am finished with this author because I know she can do better than this trio of stereoptyped, two-dimensional characters.",0
"Dylan Gennaro and Abby Adler are on the run from their violent alpha, Alan Matthews. Alan turned Abby against her will a month ago, and treats women very badly. Although Abby is more of an alpha wolf and Dylan is much more submissive, he knows he needs to get her out of this cruel pack. Near by is Red Rock Sanctuary, a pack led by Gavin and his mate Samantha. They take in runaways from these packs that have violent out of control alphas. They get word Dylan is on his way, but it starts to get late. Gavin sends one of his alpha wolves, Keith to investigate. Keith is an alpha in the pack and has spent years fighting in the wars against the wizards, so he is good in these situations. Keith discovers Abby and Dylan on the side of the road, fighting off a couple of Alan's wolves sent to bring them back. After Keith shoots them all (Did I mention he is lethal?) he escorts them safely to Red Rock.They are welcomed and given a safe place to stay. One of the first rules Gavin has is all new wolves need a Guide, someone to lead new wolves through the first couple of months. Not only teaching them the basics of being a shifter, but the bond usually goes much more intimate than that. At the end of the Guide period, the couple can choose to go their separate ways or sometimes feelings have developed and they stay together to explore their relationship.As soon as Abby and Keith meet, their wolves immediately take notice of each other. Their human sides are also very attracted. Abby has to be the one to choose the Guide, and not forced into the decision. Keith with an overwhelming protectiveness needs Abby to choose him, but being the gentleman he lets her have time to adjust and look over her options. Abby knows he is the one, and when the sexual tension is about ready to burst, she agrees and the first lesson he teaches her is in the bedroom. But the fun ends when Abby gets a picture of her sister, who has been kidnapped by Alan. With Keith's help, they race to save her.Cry Sanctuary is full of alpha male goodness. The moment Keith, or I should say his wolf sees Abby, that is it for him. He goes into growly, overprotective mode. He stalks around, on edge, being a perfect gentlemen towards Abby, but letting everyone know she is off limits. Years ago, he lost a lover, and the raw emotions from that relationship coupled with his alpha status, make for a very intense male. He sees being her Guide as an honor, and the thought of any other male near her makes him almost lose control.Abby also exudes alpha status, and although she is terrified and confused by her new life, she is a tough cookie. She accepts Keith from the beginning. I like that they never refuse or deny their attraction. When they come together, two powerful wolves in the bedroom, it's a smexy overload. Abby feels guilty for having these strong feelings for Keith and for wanting him sexually at the same time as having him for her Guide. It takes prodding from both Keith and some friends to convince her Keith wants the same thing.We also meet the other wolves of Red Rock. Leaders Gavin and Samantha run a tight ship but are very warm. Joe, Keith's friend stays his friend after he realizes Abby is off limits and provides some very sarcastic comments. Abby's friend Dylan, who is more submissive gets a book in this series and I can't wait to see what they do with his character. I sometimes thought all the residents of Red Rock, or at least the ones we meet are a little too perfect. Everyone is so nice and welcoming but you can argue Gavin is a strict alpha and doesn't let anyone get out of line. This book is also on the shorter side so we don't get a lot of background into the war with the wizards but there are several more books to the series and I'm looking forward to reading more about this group. Although there is a satisfying ending, there is much left to explore.Cry Sanctuary is a action filled paranormal romance, with plenty of alpha action to steam up the pages.",1
Short story full of umm... Same sex.thought reading something different works be a little more editing.but this was fine. Needed a little something more.,0
"This was a great book for a supe short story. The way things start out with a great plot and setting with characters that are just out there in a way that you have no chocie but to continue reading.Everyone had a place in this story. I like the way he dealt with the theft. I must say that it was very unusual how the twist of events came about, but not to tell the story all I can say is it is a must read and you will be suprised.",0
"This book seemed like it was going to be very interesting and a good love story, but unfortunately it was not. The base line of the story moved too fast, the love scenes were written for a middle schooler to read and still have no clue that it was a love scene.  The story moved too fast and left me very confused and a little frustrated because there is not explaining.  Personally, I regret getting this book even though it was free.",0
"This would be a five-star book were it not for the poor production values.  Like all the digitized books scanned by volunteers, it needs a lot of editing.But this is a Marvelous accounting of relations between the races in the South:  antebellum, during the Civil War, and Reconstruction.  It was written by a former slave who held no rancor against his former masters.  He wanted to get out the message that while Slavery itself is an Atrocity, many blacks and their white owners were reasonably happy ""families.""This is not a sensationalist, gory view of the horrors of cruel masters, but instead the fond remembrances of a man who had been well-treated and even properly prepared for Emancipation.Despite the typos and scanning glitches, I read it through twice and intend to keep it for reference.",1
"I think this is one of the best books I've ever read. The description does a great job of telling you what it's about. Two people married to others, fall in love with the other. Chelsea is married to Jake. Tyler is married to Jennifer. I loved Chelsea, Tyler, and even Jake. Jennifer, no. Hell no. I'm not much for love triangles but this doesn't exactly feel like one. Adulterers that Chelsea and Tyler are, you don't hate them. You can't. And that's hard not to do, especially because Jake, is a great husband. A true great guy. Read it, you'll see. This book has it all, the great love story, a little drama, some comedy, and some great steam. Not porn, not 'use your imagination', but  true love scenes. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1
"Very different but leaves one empty as though the story never really ended. Maybe the next book will be more complete, feeling",0
"This novella is so bad, I don't know where to start. The set up is a common thread in shifter stories, but I can accept that and move on. This is definitely an Erotica book because it is mostly sex with really no story. Don't get me wrong, I like Erotica and a really good love scene but this one left me high and dry. In the midst of the sex/love scenes in this story I actually had to look to see how much longer it was (and not 'Oh my why couldn't it be longer' but a 'Holy Cow I still have that much left to read of this crap.') Then there is the story that starts to unfold at the beginning but is never fleshed out once the sex starts. Whatever is so important that he is nearly killed guarding is never explained. The ending comes out of nowhere like the author was done writing her 30 pages of sex and needed to end the book. Then there is some of the language. I can't decide if the author was trying to use bigger words to sound educated, draw an educated reader, or just having fun with the synonyms button in Word. However, it doesn't work. Lets face it, anyone who picks up this story isn't looking for a language lesson and some of the terminology used takes the sincerity out of the book. Yes, I KNOW what ""turgid"" means but you won't hear me using that in my daily conversations and it is used multiple times in this very short story. Then there is redundancy issues like it wasn't edited before being published. Come on ""trembling tremors"" just sounds dumb and calling it her sex 10 times in a row to then switch to pussy for the next 10 times. It just bored me.Do yourself a favor and sit this one out.",0
"It was a good story line with enough action and mystery behind the characters.  Only critique would be that descriptive language did get a bit repetitive as to how the characters looked, how the author visually described the expressions on a character's face or body language to show angst, confusion, etc.  this author generally kept the language simple without big words.",0

"Plot/Storyline: 3 StarsIn the ""Forward,"" the author states that this novel is set in an alternate reality, rather than the actual future. However, I could really see this as a possible future...easily.The novel started off with some very interesting opening chapters. The author did a terrific job of setting the stage for the story. A few portions, such as the marital advice from Emily's mother, almost had me laughing out loud.Unfortunately, once the stage was set, the story just didn't live up to its promise. It just kind of limped along, struggling to make too many points. There were some interesting segments, with plenty of humor thrown in, but it just wasn't enough to make up for the exceptionally weak plot and storyline.The plot was spread out over too many side stories to maintain my interest. The saving grace of this book was the humor and the setting.Character Development: 3 1/2 StarsLewis and Emily were adequately developed, if a little simplistic. My favorite character was the author, Richmond, that worked in the bookstore. With only a relatively small part, he was still the most realistic character and had the most depth.Writing Style: 5 StarsPeople will want to read this book just for the writing style. The sentence structure created a beautiful flow that just helped me slip right into and through the novel. The descriptions were vivid. The dialogue was exceptionally well done with tremendous voice and realism.Editing/Formatting: 4 3/4 StarsThere were a few editing errors, all of which were missing words, those little words that are easy to overlook when editing, like ""for,"" ""and,"" and ""then.""The formatting was of professional quality.Rating: PG-14 for Language and Drug Use",1
"Vadim is the Beta of his father's werewolf pack. His father, being the leader, is the Alpha wolf, and Vadim is the second in command, the Beta, the protector of his father and the pack. One night, in his den, a terrified small young man bursts into the room, slamming the doors behind him, looking to hide from some unseen pursuers. Vadim looks at him, his heart starts racing, he gets sexually aroused, his face flushes with heat, and he realizes he's looking at his mate.That's the thing about werewolves. While everyone has a soulmate, werewolves recognize their mate as soon as they're nearby. A werewolf feels an intense physical, emotional, and mental attraction and yearning, often being overcome and mesmerized by their mate, the second they lay eyes on them. The young man, an Omega werewolf named Sasha, looks at Vadim, and recognizes him as his mate.Protecting his mate from the pursuers, Vadim shelters Sasha. It turns out the pursuers return with their Alpha (and Sasha's Alpha too), and when they attack Sasha, Vadim kills them in a protective rage. Since he's defeated the Alpha, he is now the Alpha for that pack, and it's his responsibility to go to them and lead them. The pack lives on Vourdala island, a nice-sized isolated island off the coast and inhabited solely by werewolves or human friends/companions/family members of werewolves.The problem is that the prior beta of that pack terrorized them. Vadim must now undo the damage caused by their old Alpha, fight against a few relatives left behind who want to see Vadim out of the picture, and get the pack to realize that omegas are no longer scapegoats and pack prostitutes, but important members of the pack almost on par with the Alpha himself. Omegas are the peacekeepers and ambassadors. They're the backbone of the pack. Vadim must get rid of the old prejudices so that Sasha can flourish.The story is interesting and fun and very sexy. Characters are nicely developed. Action and suspense scenes are on the light side, often being resolved so quickly that the reader doesn't get a chance to feel a real sense of danger. Ms. Glenn sort of does ""action lite"". The focus is on the sexy and romantic stories being told, and the characters. And she's made fun and lovable characters. If you enjoy werewolves and sexy sentimental romantic encounters, this story is for you. Heck, even if you don't enjoy werewolves, they're darn fun and interesting stories, falling fully in to the ""romance"" genre rather than the ""thriller"" or ""supernatural"" ones.",1
"I received this eBook from the author for a honest review. This is a short book about Brett and Lisa , a human and vampire and a club that was for both and the energy it creates. I liked this book because of the chemistry between the 3 characters, Brett, Lisa and Leo. It is written so that you can believe that they all belong together. another great one from Kallysten.",1
"OK this is a Trilogy so I would highly recommend buying all three because once you start reading this book you will want to read them all.  The author was new to me but for a dollar I figured I'd take a chance.  I brought all three books and was glad I did because once I finished the first one I had to know what was going to happen next.  Is this a great work of fiction maybe not but it is worth your time.  I would say the biggest issue I had with the book was the editing.  It can be a little distracting when you find obvious typos but other than that the story moved along, the characters were well developed and I'll just have to wait to see how things turn out in the last book.  Again I would recommend this book if you like the classic good vs evil story.Get the next book in the series:The ORDER of SHADDAI (The Realm Shift Trilogy #2)",1

"I have to admit right off the bat that I deleted this book from my Kindle at 3%.  In that short snippet of reading all I found out was that there were two sisters involved in the story, one of them was dumb enough to think the only way she could support herself was to either win the lottery or collect some reward money for solving a crime, one sister had big boobs that were supposed to help in this crime solving endeavor, and the other sister could get one of her legs up behind her head.That was all I needed to read to know that most likely this book would be full of idiotic back and forth banter.  No thanks, I'll pass.",0
"I was expecting a bit more, story had promise but it was just not as great as it could have been. VERY short for sure but I have read alot of short stories that kept me rivited, which this one did not, I pretty much skimmed through it. The love scene was not all it could have been either, it all in a whole felt way too rushed.",0
"Forties slang and humor somewhat forced, detracting from the plot and dialogue.I probably won't read more of the series. Two were enough.",0
"Ok the main character in this book was meant to be a super genies right?? Well for someone who is meant to be smart she was very, very stupid!!!! And the plot was terrible, who marries someone after knowing them one day, she is meant to be scared for her life and she just somehow automatically knows he's a good guy..... after he tells her that he lied about who he is and that he has had people watching her and has done a background check ( I would be pretty pissed if someone told me that) all in all this book was pretty bad it had some funny parts in it but the jokes were repetitive i wouldnt read this book again",0
I enjoyed the character development especially the bias kept between the father and his son. The fathers lack of understanding of his sons sexual preferences is so true to life that many elderly still express. Especially folks over seventy.,1
"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesRobin Maxwell has never allowed her disability to interfere with living life to the fullest. However, as a deaf woman talking to people around her,  communication becomes draining and leaves her needing solitude to recharge. Her brother Tad may have had to cancel on their ski trip at the last minute, but Robin decides to go by herself, looking forward to peace and quiet. When Robin is interrupted on her trip by the appealing Keil and his brother, she discovers life will never be the same again.Wolf Signs is a short, fast read that will appeal to paranormal romance and erotica lovers alike. Robin is stunned to find out that werewolves real, she never really knew the truth about her family, and that she has found her very own wolf mate in Keil. The attraction is immediate and hot enough to melt the mountain snow. Personally, I am not a big fan of erotica so I admit, I skipped the sex scenes, but the bits I saw are sure to satisfy readers who enjoy erotica.The plot was kept somewhat simplified to fit into the shorter word count, but Vivian Arend still managed to pack in a lot of action to keep the story moving. I loved how Robin was so happy to find out why she never quite felt like she fit anywhere, and adjusts quite easily to her new life. We even get a little bit of suspense over worrying about what will happen when Keil returns to his pack for the alpha challenge.All in all, Wolf Signs is a short, sexy, and satisfying read. Kelley A.

"I find it hard to believe all these four and five star ratings... This book, even though only 16 pages in length, was difficult to finish.  Thankfully, it was a freebie when I downloaded it.  If this is all the talent it takes to write a book, I should have taken up writing long ago!",0

"I was so excited to read the series of the Buckhorn brothers after seeing what great reviews it got and since I liked one of Foster's other books I bought the bundle.The first story in the series is about Sawyer, the oldest brother.  He's a sexy, companionate doctor who's also a loving father and amazing brother.  The story starts with him having to safe Honey after she runs her car into his fence.  He's instantly attracted to her.  The story has him wanting to find out about her and she wanting to get away from him and his brother's because she's in danger and doesn't want to endanger them.  Honesty, I was so bored reading the story.  I couldn't stay interested, I didn't care what Honey's danger was and then Sawyer somewhat was bipolar to me.  He was practically keeping Honey at his house since she was in danger and he didn't want her hurt, yet she wanted to leave and he wouldn't let her.  At times he would shake her wanting to get his words through to her, but he wasn't a violent person according to his brothers.  There were so many other things about the story that drove me nuts.  Sawyer wanted Honey to stay, but wasn't going to tell her, Honey said she felt safe with Sawyer, but wouldn't tell him anything about her big danger mystery, Sawyers brother's were always interrupting him and Honey during an intimate time, and then when a big moment came between them that would have been so much sweeter in private it's done in a causal way with his brother's all around.  Overall it just wasn't what I expected or hoped the story would be.The second story is about Morgan, the second brother.  He's the hunky Sheriff.  In his story he fights the urges to become involved with Misty, Honey's sister.  His story was much better to me than Sawyers.  I was more interested in it and Morgan didn't switch as much in personality.  However, he did mess with Misty's car when she wanted to leave and I didn't really like that he did that.  Seemed juvenile.  His scowling got old after a while, but that was just his personality.  He acted tough, but he was a big softy.  Overall it was a decent story.Gabe's story is third, but he's the youngest brother.  He's the sexy, layback, fun loving brother.  His story was great.  He meets Elizabeth who is the complete opposite of Gabe.  She's prissy, a bookworm, inexperienced, and nave.  Gabe and her clash during the book, but also have a big attraction to one another.  Gabe takes it upon himself to show Elizabeth how to have some fun in life.  This story was a little different than the other two since Elizabeth is different from Honey and Misty.  It was a fun, sexy story that showed how opposites attract.Jordan, the third brother, was the last story.  He's the sexy, calm, vet.  His story was slightly different from the rest.  He meets Georgia, who is a dancer at a bar, divorced, takes care of her mother, and had two children.  Sparks fly right away between them.  Despite Jordan not liking Georgia being a dancer, he never tried to force her to quit and accepted her for who she was and what she had to do to take care of her kids.  I was worried his story was going to be short and he was a great guy so I was glad his story turned out to be complete.  His book was probably my second favorite after Gabe's.Casey, Sawyer son, was also more involved in this story and there's one he's in called Enticing.Overall the series started out a little rocky, but ended up great.  All four brothers have great qualities about them and some flaws.  At times in any of the stories things became predictable.  Also it seemed like every brother fell instantly in love with the woman in their story.  There wasn't a lot of leading up to them realizing they had feelings, it happened right away every time.  But in the end, you can't help but fall in love with each of them.",1
"You know the way sometimes you're flipping channels and you get to the Science Fiction station and notice they're running some obviously super low-budget made-for-TV movie with some ludicrous premise - and you settle in to enjoy watching an extremely bad movie?It's that well-known ""it's-so-bad-it's-good"" phenomenon. A couple of years ago I happened upon a Sci-Fi Channel offering about a guy who turned into a giant mosquito! Ha, ha! Did you see that one? Boy, it was so screamingly dumb! But it's fun to watch goofy crap like that occasionally because - well -- I'll just leave it to some psychologist to score a government grant some day and explain the why-we-like-bad-entertainment phenomenon.But I mention this because I have just finished reading the short novel, CHUPACABRA, by DALLAS TANNER. I'll come right out with a theory I have about this offering: I'm thinking that Mr. Tanner may have first attempted to write a script for a made-for-TV B movie, shopped it around, got no bites, and so decided to turn his script into a short novel.As the title suggests, this is a yarn using the legendary CHUPACABRA- the goatsucker - of mostly Latin American legend, as a premise. It's some kind of crypto-zoological beast with vampire-like tendencies that preys on farm animals. It sucks its victim dry of blood - but leaves the meat.Unfortunately, reading a bad science fiction novel does not deliver the same pleasure as watching a bad movie. I think it's because you have to work harder - you know, with the reading, and all. When you watch a terrible TV movie, you just sit back with a beer and a bag of Cheetos and let the dreck come to you. When you read a B-novel, there's all that effort with the squinting at words and turning of pages, and such.As fiction, Chupacabra makes every conceivable literary mistake a writer can make to ensure that this will be a truly terrible piece of writing - clich&eacute;-cardboard characters, blocks of exposition without action, absolutely no original concepts, and supremely poor editing.Consider: One of the characters is a lovely Caribbean-born scientist who is something of an expert on the Chupacabra. She is alternately identified as: ""an astronomer,"" ""an astrologer,"" ""an astronomist,"" and ""a technician."" I take pains to point this out to show you that I am not merely being purposefully mean and snarky in my review, but that I am only applying the unfortunate credit to where the unfortunate credit it due.You might be surprised that I am going to say now that this author is almost certainly a far, far better writer than this novella suggests. I've been making my sole living as a freelance writer and editor for almost 30 years, and one develops an instinct for those who have ""got it"" and those who never will. Dallas Tanner has what it takes to be a genuinely fine writer, believe me -- I can just tell - but no one will be able to tell from reading this book.",0
"Lyla Sinclair is a terrific author.  I have always enjoyed her books immensely.  That being said, ""Training Emily"" was a huge disappointment.  The character Mark Kendall is an angry college professor whose wife left him five years ago.  Emily is his student who is failing his class and who has lusted after him for years.  The premise is good one but it falls far short of what it could have been.  Mark is a wannabe Dom and a cruel b*****d.  What really ticked me off is that Emily kept wondering if she had 'daddy issues'.  Gag me.  (no pun intended).  If this had been the first book I had ever read by this author I never would have picked up any more.  The price is not worth the time or effort that this reader put out.",0
"What a pleasant surprise!  When I got this kindle book from Amazon, I really expected little. What I did get was a book that slowly captured my interest and pulled me into its pages. Before I got the e-book, I worried a bit about the plot line as it sounded just like another of the Dan Brown ""wanna-bes""; however, the ""Secret of the Scroll"" by Chester D. Campbell delivers on all levels and is a wonderful read and a thriller that is hard to put down.Retired Air Force OSI Agent Greg McKenzie and his wife Jill are on a trip to the Holy Land. Shortly before they return home, a souvenir street vendor convinces Jill to purchase a ""souvenir"" that turns out to be an ancient scroll. When they innocently return home, the McKenzie's world turns upside down as Jill is taken hostage in a battle between militant Palestinians and radical Israelis to recover this ancient scroll. The police, however, target Greg as a suspect in his wife's disappearance, and with a little help from his friends (and a few others), he sets out alone in a perilous chase to save his wife as she is spirited out of America and back to Israel.The ""Secret of the Scroll"" is honestly a classic page-turner; I often kept reading when I knew I should go to sleep. I just kept saying; ""Just one more chapter.""  It is a thriller without a large body count; it is a book about an historical artifact without trying to clone Dan Brown.  Yes, there is plenty of action and intrigue, but the real suspense comes from all of McKenzie's efforts to save his wife while trying to stay a step ahead of the mysterious figures who will stop at nothing to get the scroll. While there are many twists and turns in store for the reader, there is as well a strong realism in the characterization of the main character who seems to be a bit more like your neighbor rather than a James Bond super-hero type. You will like these characters and you will like the book - ""Secret of the Scroll"" (Greg McKenzie Mysteries #1).",1
"Second WindCathy Walker threw her expensive suitcase in her Thunderbird as Rafe watched and begged her not to leave, but this time his sad puppy eyes were not going to sway her fromleaving this time no matter how good the sex was between them!

"I don't normally buy 'mystery' novels because I just don't like them.  However, this time I decided to take a chance and I am glad I did.I found the story engrossing, the characters engaging, and it was well written.

"This work was Journey to the Center of the Earth. Just the other day, I realized I had never read it. I loved the old movie and being the reader that I am, I could not believe my neglect.This is the translation of the Jules Verne original and I must say, at times the reading is rough. It was written and translated long ago so some of the words are...confusing as well as sentence structure and meaning. But even through all that I still enjoyed the read. I did find the main character a bit childish, whinney and silly and very self centered. I put it down to the day and age that the book was written. An enjoyable classic that I will probably never read again but glad I did read it once. I would recommend to all to read at least once in your lifetime.",0
"the verb tense was frequently wrong, at least in the beginning of the book.  &#34;doesn't&#34; where the word should have been didn't...etc.I stopped reading early on because this poor editing was so irritating.it was also irritating that the only man to notice that this woman was beautiful was a man made ugly by his scars, and in the reverse, the only woman to seeming notice that the man was handsome was a Plain Jane woman.I know that this is how it usually is in real life, the stud marries the gorgeous gal, and you rarely see the nerd with the pretty woman, or the Plain Jane with a stud muffin.  our society is so obsessed with appearance.  still, that aspect of the book irritated me as well.",0
"Apparently the character and storyline is a reprisal of a couple of earlier books.  Although there are some vaguely interesting ideas here, most of this short story consists of bureaucratic office humor (which only Dilbert gets right).  It was a nice try, but thankfully free, and I don't think I'll bother with the books.",0

"It was a good book, though I got confused when all of a sudden his affections seemed to change. As we start reading, I thought that he was going to go with Darla, the panther shapeshifter. He was talking about how he had watched over her, and was starting to get a little hot and bothered since there were no owl shapeshifters in the area. And I for one love that owl's were featured instead of the typical werewolves or panthers. I think that was my favorite part of the book. I'm glad he ends up with another owl shifter, but it still sure was confusing.There were some things here and there that seemed odd, not to mention them getting straight to business, if you know what I mean, the same day they meet. A bit fast, but then you could blame it on the animal side. All in all, it was a great book, I felt that it wasn't extremely predictable, and it was not stereotypical, either.",1
"This book will be added to my ever growing list of, ""I'm glad it was free."" I'm starting to think that all the ""give the ebook away free so we can get buzz going"" should stop because 9 outta 10 times the feed back is bad. The writting was very choppy and the story reminded me of one of many sci/fi B movies I've seen.",0
"The plot seemed contrived, predictable and improbable.This author is better than this.And really, you had Noah's ark! Why add weapons of mass destruction?Severall characters were one-dimensional at best.Many phrases were so off the wall they were funny, like ""Tiny black spots swirled across my vision, like flies at a picnic lunch"".This novel left me underwhelmed. Don't judge the author by this novel alone.",0
"With his graduation finally near, Harlan Sheppard is closer to his goal of obtaining the one thing he always wanted and it's not his diploma.  Harlan has worked as a teaching assistant for Professor Sawyer Addison for the past two years and he has lusted after him every single day. Unfortunately Sawyer only saw him as a student and considered him to be off limits, but Harlan was determined to show him otherwise.  Harlan worked his way through college as a male stripper and drawing on that experience he sets into motion a plan to seduce the object of his desire.Sawyer refused to get involve with his student no matter how much he was attracted to him. Even though Harlan will no longer be his student, Sawyer is still hesitant to get involve with him because of his job at the strip club. He was not sure he can handle having his boyfriend lusted after night after night.  When Harlan's persistence wears down Sawyer's resistance will the two be able to sustain a relationship outside of the bedroom?You can Leave Your Hat On is a very hot and sexy story, with a great storyline, but unfortunately I wasn't very taken with the characters. Physically, Sawyer and Harlan were hot together, but outside of the bedroom, I didn't like Sawyer very much.  I found him to be very rude and domineering and I did not like how he treated Harlan.  Actually most of the characters came across as smart mouth and egotistical and that was a bit of a turn off. I also found that the story opened up subplots that left me wondering the outcome, especially where Harlan's brother was concerned.  Outside of the sex scenes, You Can Leave Your Hat On did not hold my interest, but other readers and fans of Lena Matthews may find it more to their liking.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",0
"Insta-lust for someone whose face you haven't seen or even spoken a word to is absolutely ridiculous. There is nothing sexy about a scene that is horribly unbelievable. And seriously, what girl has multiple orgasms literally back to back on her first time?",0
This book was just one more great example of Delle Jacobs Scottish tales.  I love her writing.  It takes you into the story and makes you part of it!,1
This is a pretty hot/fun menage story. I love both male leads. Just the right amount of aggressiveness when having to men to contend with. I thought it was a fun read and fast moving. It was a quick feel good story and not a serious storyline to it. I would recommend it for an in between book when trying to decide on something more intense to read.,0
The title kind of gives away the fact that the children will become orphans. The time in which this story is based shows that life was hard and that people could die in a short time without medication and for unknown reasons. I enjoyed the book but had one problem with it. They pulled Mary's two front teeth but then they kept talking about how beautiful she had become! Seems a little strange to me.,1
"I love Maya, but even though it was a short story their could have been more meat to the story. Without giving too much away, Cael and Riyu should have given Heather a chance to tell her side of what happened. I felt a disconnection between the characters and not Mayas usual bond.",0
"SPOILERS AHEAD......Basically this is the story of Troy who nine years prior cheated on his fianc&eacute;e Bree with her best friend Meg. When Meg turns out to be pregnant, he elopes with her and they marry. He only tells Bree after, and then only by phone. By sheer coincidence Bree was going to tell Troy she was pregnant herself. Instead she left town, but lost the baby at three months pregnant.Present day and Bree has returned home for her sisters wedding. Of course she runs into Troy. Who had lost Meg in a road traffic accident fours years before. But he berates Bree for not attending the funeral. After all both he and Meg had apologised.Troy never knew about Bree's pregnancy or miscarriage, she never told him.What a shambolic mess this story is. The reader is never shown anything that happened in the past. All we get are small remembered snippets of conversations. The main story that is set in the present is weak, very little happens. The characters are shallow and self absorbed. I found it very difficult to relate to them in any way. Nothing happens except Troy constantly blames Bree for leaving town, and he can't understand why Bree who was madly in love with him wouldn't want to hang round and watch him play happy ever after with her best friend. As for Bree she should have told him she was pregnant. It might have made this a more interesting tale. And just to top it all off, Bree's father tells her that when Meg got pregnant he was the one who told Troy to marry her. But then as her father was a cheater himself what else can you expect. With family like that who needs enemies.If I could have given this no stars I would have. First and last read for me by this author. Don't waste your money.",0

"This is a good start to the series.  Make it though this book and the second one is much better.  One sex scene worked well;  the other one, as other reviewers have noted comes out of left field.  My brother's kidnapped and missing, and I think enough not only to pack sex toy, but find a way to use them in my parents house?!?  Maybe in another setting it would have worked, but not here.  All in all, it introduces us to some characters that are interesting.  You come to be engaged in all their lives.",1

"This one is told from the point of view of Charles.  It is very well done.  Henry again has to step in and solve the mystery.  As a previous resident of the Coachella Valley, these books are especially fun for me.  If you have never been to Palm Springs and the surrounding area, the descriptions are wonderfully accurate.  Please read these books from book one.",1
"I bought this set and returned it.  I couldn't force myself to finish the first book, A Touch of Silk.  ( They are bundled out of order, too).  The writing and phrasing was so immature that I thought at first it was a satire!  But the pages and pages of supposedly erotic fantasy stuffing the book to bring up the word count was the final blow.  No character development, not enough background.  What should have been interesting read like a pre- teen fantasy.  Don't waste your money.",0
"I received a copy of this book free and I was very excited by the title and description.  It is indeed a creative back story of an old fairy tale.  However, it is very hard to follow the characters and the time line (chapters jump you back and forth).  I found the story difficult to read and would often step away from the story for a day or more before picking it back up again. I did not connect with any of the characters, so I did not care if they lived or died.  Consequently, I will not be reading the sequel.",0
"This author makes basic grammatical mistakes, switches storytelling tenses for no fathomable reason, and takes way too long to get her story started. Needs ruthless editing to even be passable.And as for writing like Stepehnie Meyer? Well, possibly, but I would not mean that as a compliment... This reads like a 14 year old attempting to write from an adult perspective.A shame, as I feel like there is a lively style under there trying hard to get out. Ms. Munday needs a few hundred thousand words under her belt to hone her style, and a seriously brutal editor to cut out the extraneous padding.",0

"THIS IS A WARNING TO ANYONE THINKING ABOUT READING THIS SERIES. THIS SERIES CONTAINS REFERENCE TO, AND IN THE FINAL BOOK, AN ENTIRE STORY REVOLVING AROUND INCEST.This first book in the series is just basically an introduction to the series, and contained no reference to incest, but the second book did. I bought the other three books in the series based solely on this book, because I liked Sonny and Garron and wanted to find out how their story progressed. References to the incestuous relationship between Sonny's identical twin brothers starts in the second book, and through character thoughts and conversations, the author makes it clear that the relationship is long-term (going back to childhood), consensual, and accepted without a murmur by the rest of the family and apparently the entire town. I found this beyond disturbing, and promptly returned the entire series for a refund.After returning them, I went back and read the book descriptions more thoroughly, but beyond a vaguely worded comment in the description of the fourth book, none of them carry any kind of warning that these books contain sensitive or disturbing material. I did find references when I read all the reviews of the fourth book, but it should not be up to the readers to warn others about things like this. That should be responsibility of the publishers and Amazon. That even the fourth book, which deals directly with the incestuous relationship, carried no warning whatsoever is completely unacceptable.So I'm putting this warning on the first book in the series, before people get involved with the characters and their stories. I will also be reading the descriptions and every single review for any books I consider purchasing from this author in the future.",0
"CRISS CROSS (PsyCop #2) by Jordan Castillo Price.Vic has too many wimpy characteristics.  He always wants to get high.  He takes double doses of his medicine and other drugs to feel better.  Much of the time he is incompetent because he is in a haze.  You'd think that since he's been seeing ghosts for most of his life, he'd be used to it and have ways to deal with it.  But no, he's freaking out all the time trying to run away from every ghost he sees.  The reason he's a psycop is because he can talk to ghosts.  I was disappointed that he didn't use that skill in either of the first two books.  But to be fair he does talk to one or two ghosts briefly in each book - but not related to solving a case.Second, in addition to running away from ghosts, he runs away from people - his friends, his acquaintances, his lover.  He buys crystals to help him with a problem, but then he runs away from the guy without knowing how to use them.  Later he must return to the guy to ask how to use the crystals.  A ghost tells him how (which may or may not be true), so Vic runs away from the guy again without getting instructions.  When others ask Vic how things are, he lies and says fine so they will go away and leave him alone.  This did not interest me.  It frustrated me.  Experts say ""don't write about wimps.""  I agree.  Vic is a wimp.Vic leaves his phone turned off, so when friends try to reach him, they can't.  He intends to tell Jacob (his lover) about a problem, but he wimps out and doesn't tell him.  When Jacob starts to talk about something, Vic says ""Do we have to talk about it right this second?""  Again, running away.Later when some bad guys are caught and the cops are asking Vic for details, Vic doesn't tell them that the bad guys have other safe houses.  I did not like his reason.  Some might say the reason was stupid.  Others might say he had a believable motive for keeping the secret, but he didn't act on it.  So his lying to the cops was for nothing.I really liked the relationship with Jacob.  It's hot.  Jacob is so intense and into Vic.  It's too bad the surrounding story was weak.DATA:Narrative mode: first person Vic.  Kindle count story length: 2078 (314 KB).  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.

"KND is a great way for authors to connect with Kindle readers as well as finding new and creative writers who aren't easy to find anymore.  Unless your last name is Patterson or Grisham NY publishers aren't spending money to promote your work, so this is a solid way to discover new talent.Besides, one of the nice features of a Kindle is the ability to sample a writers works and KND offers a deeper sampling as well.I've found two authors I never heard of with this blog and reading a solid book for $2.99 is one of the great attractions to the digital world.",1
"First of all, I've been to lots of different types of home sales parties and I have to stay that the door prize won here had to be at least $80.  That is quite a generous prize.Second, while I appreciate that the author tried to write a story with appeal for bigger women and their fans, it didn't really make sense that the male main was lusting after her all this time while dating women who were her physical opposite.  There is no shortage of size 14 women in this country -- surely he could have found one to date.All in all, this was a perfectly okay story.  Nothing that I'll remember long term.  I don't think the author took enough advantage of the ""toy"" concept.  They were just there to get the plot jump-started but she was afraid to encorporate them fully into the story.",0

This is a well crafted and humorous story about the demise of the analog dead tree book and bookstores (I don't think Ms. Stewart is too far off the mark on this), the crazy California culture, with a bit of political and corporate intrigue thrown in for good measure.It's highly entertaining, with a great cast of characters.  I found that I couldn't put the book down (ebook that is).A real gem of a story, and a great read.",1
i have read a couple of this authors books.and alot of them are hit or miss. but this had to be the most dumbest book i have ever read. the lead character was stupid. this author has a big problem with lead character. the females are usually naive to point of being a child. even when they are in their 30's. they put unrealistic goals on the lead male character that in the real world would never fly.stay away from this book. it is not worth the price it should have been for free.this book has made not want to ever read another book by this author.,0
"Another classic example of Amazon's review system being gamed.  'Scion' is appallingly trite, poorly edited, completely predictable, and so choppy that it is often hard to figure out what happened from one paragraph to the next.  The characters are shallow and unbelievable -- a ten-year-old's idea of good guys and bad guys. There are so many technical errors in the book that it's almost amusing, and the laws of physics become mere suggestions. I almost abandonded the book after I realized all of the positive reviews must have come from the author and his friends  (because no self-respecting Amazon reader would give this book more than two stars), but kept reading out of morbid curiosity.

"I never thought I would give anything written by Laurann Dohner a bad review. She is one of my favorite romance writers, and I love her New Species series. The first Zorn Warriors book was pretty good, and more in keeping with her usual tone. This second installment failed on so many levels for me. I couldn't develop any liking for the hero, mostly because throughout the book he continually took away the heroine's choices. While he repeatedly tells the heroine that she's his world and he'd do anything to keep her, he never once considers what SHE wants or how she feels about being kidnapped and forced into a lifestyle she didn't choose for herself.What's more, there's no &#34;a-ha&#34; moment when he realizes HIS happiness is not necessarily the key to HER being happy too. I kept waiting for him to redeem himself but it just never happened.And the heroine seemed weak to me because even though she didn't shy away from physical confrontation, she never really tells him &#34;NO.&#34; That subtext of &#34;her lips say no but her eyes say yes&#34; played here ad nauseum. Her protests were pretty weak and insincere, which makes her either totally spineless or the kind of woman who says one thing, means another and expects the guy to know what she wants without her really saying so.Don't get me wrong, I'll never give up reading Laurann. This book, however, will definitely be on my &#34;don't need to read THAT again&#34; list.",0
"Proofreading issues aside.  Bob Moats' Classmates Murder draws you in with interesting characters who are believable and likeable.  His stories are romantic and compelling without the ""lust and thrust"" and foul language so often forced on the reader by many authors.  I did not intend to get caught up in this series, but by the end of Classmate's Murders I was curious how the characters would continue to develop.  I eagerly looked forward to each book in the series and watching the author ripen with each new book.  I think I see a Best Selling Author in the making!",1

"This book was so poorly written that it is an insult to even call it a book; it is more like a very poorly written paper that would have had a failing grade.  I overlooked the first typo, then the second, then the third, but when I had to start re-reading entire paragraphs, and re-wording them for it to make sense I had to stop reading the book altogether.  Then there is the story or the lack thereof, I was almost halfway through and still had no idea why her parents, the boyfriend and his family were kidnapped.  Perhaps this was explained later, but halfway though and I still have no idea what's going on!  Also, the author portrays Heather as a stereotypical, ditzy, ""princess"".  She spoke at times like she was a five year old little girl, utterly ridiculous! The other reviews giving this a five star rating were obviously written by friends and family of the author, to say this was ""written exceptionally well"" is a flat out lie.",0
"Five years ago, Duncan has pushed Tara away from his life in order to allow her to pursue her dream of singing. A successful Tara comes back for two nights only to participate in a holiday charity concert, and to lay the past to rest.This is a short story with hot sexy scenes. If you have only an hour to devote to reading, this is for you.These are great characters and my only complaint is that this story could have been developed into a full lenght novel.",0
"It was vague,but good. Maybe too much technical jargon,and a little dry,for little kids to understandI thought that it would bring up love a little more,or lust.",0
"I was intrigued by the description, sucked in by the sample, and pissed when I found out there was only 3 books in the series. I liked it that much. Thankfully she branched off this trilogy with the glass trilogy so I can continue to get my fix.",1
"I loved Brody and Hayden's story. It was passionate, funny and dramatic. The storyline was great. A well written story is something that is important to me. And this story was very well written. When Hayden approached Brody I'm sure she had no idea what she was getting into. I loved the part when they found out exactly who each other were. I also loved the bridge jokes. It kept me laughing. Who says you can't have it all, A loving man who is also a hottie and a bad boy.This is most definitely in my re-read pile.",1
"I couldn't finish. There are strong points - the core story is familiar (average Joe's life is destroyed, works to obtain revenge), and the details of that story are handled reasonably well.  Valdieron and his life are introduced deliberately to permit us to feel some sympathy before the forces of evil wreak havoc in his life.  Mr. Day conveys a familiar cozy set of place and then burns it to the ground so that we feel Valdieron's anger.  Unfortunately after that the plot advances through external exposition.  Some sort of ghost or ancient spirit has been waiting for centuries to pass along plot exposition which isn't very interesting or well written.  But the second or third appearance the ghost is assigning quests.  At which point the story falls apart.  I lose interest in books where the characters' actions are driven by external forces.  Conflict and drama arise through character motivation and action.I'm also somewhat allergic to the super-human scale of ""save the world"" - Day's conceit that demons are invading from another dimension was introduced well enough to permit me to ignore the scale of the plot at first.  As long as the characters were learning about the external threat through actions that were intrinsic to the story, I was willing to coast along and ignore the end of the world. But if the story is so weak that it needs the services of a century old ghost to move things along, then I've lost interest.  Those ghosts are, both metaphorically and literally, less than two dimensional characters.  Every moment that the protagonist spends interacting with them is stolen from potential character development that would result from the protagonist's interaction with a real, motivated, three dimensional character.I'm surprised because Mr. Day shows a commendable restraint on other matters. There are relatively few superlatives - the main character is scaled like a normal human, not like the astonishingly gifted heroes that inhabit much fantasy fiction. Unlike many other low budget fantasy novels I've read recently, women are depicted well and fairly.  In scenes where gender doesn't matter, gender is given no more attention than hair color or dress; just another attribute to enable the reader to remember who is who. In the very few scenes where gender does matter, it is not possible to predict the character's action based on their gender.  In point of fact the female romantic lead had the promise to be one of the more interesting characters in the book with real, conflicted motivation.I'd suggest that Mr. Day have a chat with a horse person before writing about stallions again; I'm given to understand that leaving a stallion in the middle of a herd of unfamiliar horses isn't the wisest idea.Ultimately I've got a limited amount of time in my life to read, and I'd rather spend it on something with fewer, less obtrusive plot devices.",0
"I've waded through the whole series before commenting.First the good:Lalonde has some interesting ideas, creates characters one can care about, and in many ways spins a good yarn.  As with much classic sci-fi, we must suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the yarn. I therefore didn't ding him very much for the inconsistencies others have noted.Now the bad:Even with Broadcast 6, Lalonde's writing remains a major distraction. He often uses words that don't mean what he thinks they mean. Many of his sentences are run-ons or fragments. Too many are almost (or are completely) unintelligible.  He doesn't seem to know the differences between ""were"" and ""was,"" ""they're"" and ""their,"" ""its"" and ""it's,"" ""whose"" and ""who's"" or ""affect"" and ""effect.""  He consistently drops clunkers like ""her and Laura,"" ""her and her mother,"" and (unforgivably, since I don't think there's ever a place for) ""her and I.""  It's just sloppy writing, and makes it hard to appreciate the story line.  His poor punctuation makes it worse.While the books are inexpensive, I'd suggest that Lalonde hire a good editor even if it adds to the retail price.  Unless that happens, I doubt I'll be reading any more of his work.",0
"This author took a plot that I found so appealing in other books and pretty much trashed it. This was so bad I was rolling my eyes while reading it! Come on now, she is shopping for her wedding dress and someone on a loudspeaker says &#34;Attention People Of Earth&#34;. Was I suppose to take this book seriously? The author gave little to no detail in this book about anything, I had to stop reading it! I hope this is not a start of a series, because if it is count me out!!",0
"After reading the entire Star Wars:Legacy of the Force series I decided that I would commit to the next one, the Fate of the Jedi.  In the second book in the series (Omen)we are introduced to a new Sith culture, one that has been accidentally seperated from the rest of the galaxy for the last 5000 years.  This is very different from the ""There can only be Two"" Sith culture, which makes sense since they missed the whole rise of Darth Bane, the Sith Lord that founded the rule of two.This short story, The Lost Tribe of the Sith: Precipice, is the back story on how the Sith ended up on the planet Kesh.  Set 5000 years before time of The Fate of the Jedi we are introduced to a galaxy full of Sith.  If you plan of reading TFOTJ: Omen, this will give you insight into some of the most interesting and complex villians to inhabit the Star Wars expanded universe in some time.  I am guessing there will be several short books in this series, each timed to gather interest in the Fate of the Jedi stories.  Far from being just a publicity vehicle I found the story intriging and engaging.  It adds to the legend of some of the baddest guys in the galaxy, the Sith.  I look forward to the next stories in this clever series.Omen (Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi, Book 2)",1
This is an ok read.  This story line is set in the 1930's and detective Dance is the protagonist.  Dance is a trust fund baby who has been exiled by his parents due to photos of him and a boyfriend.  Detective Dancy is given several cases throughout this novel which are interesting as are his friends and employees.  Again this is an ok read but I prefer Jesse and Tim from his Big Boy detective stories.,0
"Ordered this given my Celtic heritage. I enjoyed these short 12th century tales but wish they were longer as the book lasted all of 30 minutes if that. Another one I heartily enjoyed was ""The Songs of Power: A Finnish Tale of Magic, Retold from the Kalevala"" if you would care to give my review a look for that as well.  Definitely worth seeing more of what this author has uncovered with regards to tales of old.",1
"In something as short as flash fiction, where every word has to count, I simply don't get the point of repeating ""dark"" as many times as the author does at the beginning of this story.  Once you get past the annoying repetition, you have some pretty standard description and a ""twist"" ending.None of it really worked for me.  It came across as something written for a school assignment.",0
"This book reminded me of that reality tv show Dating in the Dark. I enjoyed this one. It was good, but the ending sort of ruined it a little for me. Not completely but enough.Basically, Delia is trying to get more people to support the library. It's not doing so well and the Library Appreciation day is coming up and she knows she needs something huge to get people to show. She tells everyone a surprise visitor is coming. Little do they know it's Bobo, the retired hockey player that lives in town and his act has been done over and over again. That is until Justin Archer shows up out of now where. Voted American Woman's sexist man alive. Unfortunately, before Delia could ask him for his help he leaves.Delia finds herself locked in the basement with Justin and he wants to keep their identities secret. Mainly, because he doesn't want the girl to recognize him as the sexiest man alive. What Justin doesn't know is that Delia knows exactly who he is. They talk for hours and hours and really get to know each other. Without being able to see each other.The ending was a little too gooey for me. I'm thinking there should have been some hard feelings in there somewhere. Things don't always work out the way you want them to. I'm thinking if the ending was a little more dragged out, it would have made more sense. Or at least been more believable. It was a cute fast read.",1
"3.5 StarsWhile well written, not a favorite for me...Emmy was just too much of the ""lost woman"", while some of her being lost was very understandable she was still a bit too much of a damsel in distress for me....and while there is a ""mostly"" happily ever after it is also incredibly sad, especially since it took breaking Emmy's heart and then losing their brother for Taggert and Greer to realize how wrong they were.....",0
I have read a few horribly written books and I rank this one among the top 5. I felt that had it been offered for free it would have still been overpriced. This book took hours from my life that I won't ever get back. I will be wary of reading anything else by this author.,0
The hottest thing about this book (IMO) is the book cover and the second hottest thing about it is the product description.  I am wondering if someone else wrote the description for the author because inside the book the writing isn't very good.  The book definitely needs editing.  It reads like a choppy rough draft because of the numerous grammatical errors.  The book contains Master/slave as well as several f/f scenes.  This book was not what I expected.  I even went back and reread the product description to make sure I was reading the correct book on my kindle.  Save your money!,0
This is a great book. I enjoyed the characters and the story line.  It was a good read and didn't require a lot of thought.,1
The build up was for what? You give the climax of the book such high standards and to not give it to your readers is cruel.,0

"I came across this bundle and for the price decided to give it a try as I love the genre. The writing is quick witted and the author describes in wonderful details her characters. In fact, I can almost imagine already seeing many of the non-lead characters interwoven in future books! Julia Grey has truly grown throughout the series and is an engaging heroine and perfect match for Brisbane.",1
"I thought the stories were quite boring.  I usually love a good ghost story, but these just didn't do it for me.",0
"This book touches and teaches.  You get to know and appreciate the people involved, even the gentiles who aided and loved them.

"Moxie Mezcal, &lt;strong>Sweet Dream, Silver Screen&lt;/strong> (Moxie Mezcal Publishing, 2009)Moxie Mezcal. Two drinks that, mixed, would probably combine to form the worst taste you've ever had in your mouth. Thankfully, you don't have to drink it to want to read it. Tough, literate (if amateur at times), fun slice of neo-noir reminiscent more than once of what might have happened had Kathy Acker decided to try and write Raymond Chandler.  I should probably take points off for the meta, but I'd just end up adding them back on for the wit and honesty: ""I was behind the wheel while he thumbed through the dog-eared paperback I had been lugging around in my backpack. It was a cheap murder mystery called &lt;em>Invisible Ink&lt;/em> that tried to ape the old hard-boiled detective stories of Mickey Spillane and Raymond Chandler with mixed results."" Indeed. I've read a number of complaints with the ending; I didn't see it. I'm wondering if folks didn't get it (while Mezcal drops enough hints to what's going on, she doesn't point them out--and I'm factoring in that I could be totally misreading it myself) or whether it's just too ambiguous for the average reader, but I didn't have such problems. Good stuff from a solid new voice in thrillers. Check it out. ****",1
"This prequel seemed a little odd to me at first, not knowing anything about the series, but as I continued in the series I liked it more and appreciated it more, for its backstory.  The characters are good, if what a little confusing at first, but overall a short, but good read.",1
"This book has a great start and an even better premise. The ""Elegant Corpse"" is found on the sofa of Homicide Detective Roger Corso. That begins a very different sort of investigation, with Roger struggling to balance his job with his ""lifestyle"". He's out as a gay cop, but much less so with his leather likes and Dom persona. His two worlds all come together when he meets the victim's brother Sean, who he's immediately attracted to.Sean is probably the most likable character in the book. And he hooks Roger from the word go. Their relationship, struggles, and ability to read each other is very well written. If the book were solely about their relationship, I'd easily give the book 5 stars. I really did enjoy their building relationship and how Sean may be the Sub, but he's not a pushover or willing to settle for being a side part of Roger's life.However, the investigatory side of the story was a huge disappointment. The identity of the villian screams from the pages, yet Roger doesn't have the faintest clue until Sean is in servere danger and someone else literally tells Roger the name of the villan. People in Roger's alternate life are directly involved with the muders, yet he doesn't look into any of them or really seem to think they could be involved.",0
"I like the pace of the story,the plot and its characters, in general, Reanne Thayne has done well again.  A good exciting read.",1
"I missed the note about ""explicit content"" so I was quite shocked when I started reading. It starts out with very sadistic descriptions and grossly described sexual situations. Plus, it is deliberately written with no capitalization which is very hard to read. I have no idea how this book ended up on the Top 100 Free Books in Science Fiction. Sorry to say, but this book looks like the product of a sick mind.  I won't be reading it.",0
"Make sure you check the author when you get a Zombie Chronicles book, I noticed that there are several books called The Zombie Chronicles written by several different authors, I don't know if the others are good, bad, or otherwise, but the set written by Mark Clodi are really good reading.  I got so hooked on this series that when I read the last one I was a little lost on what to read. I started a couple of different books before I settled in.  It is just hard to find books that compare.  I just found out that he has writted a few companion books to this series and I got them and can't wait to get to them.READ THIS SERIES!!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!",1
"There were several errors. For one, when did Mercedes get married? There were references to her marriage & divorce but I don't recall either situation. And words were hyphenated unnecessarily, such as one syllable words or 2 letter words. Sometimes the story just jumped into something else. And for Rico to be so hard when she met him, he sure turned soft quick. And the story just ended with no warning. I will probably look for the second part but I won't make a run for it",1
"I had a hard time putting this book down.  Ellen knows how to write sex scenes!  I enjoyed the story line and the characters, but I didn't feel invested in the outcome.  I would have liked more substance to the story.  The story is well written, edited and formatted.",0
Always a fantastic read.  Good for all ages and tastes.  Well worth the time spent enjoying the story.  Better than the movies.,1
"I loved this book!  Quick read, couldn't put it now! Great love story & steamy sex scenes!  Marriage man&egrave;ge! Awesome!",1
"I actually picked up book 2 first but decided to go all the way back to the beginning to start reading, so I downloaded this; I think it ended up being a key piece of the series.Reading the books that are available in this series so far (My Soul to Take (Soul Screamers Book 1),My Soul to Save (Soul Screamers Book 2)), the quality increases with each book, the storylines becoming more complex and the main characters develop significantly.  My Soul To Lose, being both the introduction and the shortest, focuses mostly on a single event and a small group of characters.  While it would be a moderately good urban fantasy on its own, if readers only knew it would be part of a planned series, this novella ended with enough teasers that as a fan of this genre, I'd want to pick up the next book.Vincent has a nice writing style and this was a pretty intense story from the beginning.  I immediately liked Kaylee and disliked her family, so the author did a great job there.  The fantasy elements were very well done without being cheesy and it was refreshing to read a paranormal/urban fantasy that was a little off the beaten path.My Soul to Keep (Soul Screamers, Book 3)will be available in June 2010",1
"Another fantastic and emerging story from one of the best authors around . You can't find it in YOU to put it down . From the start it draws you into the world of dragons and their fighting riders , DON'T MISS THIS SERIES !!!!!",1
This is a very good  sexy story about two cousins Collin and Becket deSaxby who have been in competition for a servants daughter Christiana who was their friend since childhood. Beckett has her return to the castle after her father's death as she is on the verge of starvation. He has desired her forever but never acted on it. Something happened between she and Collin years ago that bothered him it was disclosed at the end. Beckett and she finally began a sexual relationship both care for each other but never  admit it. She was kidnapped and rescued by a mysterious masked man caled Blackwell who has been protecting the king from an evil nobleman. Christiana knows it is Beckett who is Blackwell by a tattoo and acts sexually to him. He refuses her and is very hurt.She goes back to the Castle knowing it is over between them.He returns bringing a wife to be and her family .Tels her she has to leave which she already knows. It all works out to a HEA he finally learns she knew who he was as Blackwell.  He realizes he waas jealous of his own self. I had not read any of her books  before but will look for more .,1
I actually like this. It was short but it kept my attention. The story flowed and you could connect with the character. It could have used more of a storyline of what happened after they slept together but for a short story it wasn't bad,0
"Not sure how I would cataloge this book. Not my kind of love, not my kind of sex, but still like most books interesting to read at least once.",0
Lady Amelia has decided to take a lover. Announcing it to her husband over breakfast probably wasn't the way to begin this adventure.Victoria Alexander has a way of making me laugh that no one else does! The antics of this husband and wife are truely hilarious. She really doesn't want a lover - just her husband's attention. He really doesn't want her to take a lover - but he offers to help. They both enlist the help of his twin brother and renowned rake in achieving their true goal.It really is one of the funniest books I've read in a very long time - and Victoria Alexander is always a favorite!,1
I picked this up thinking it would be a short sexy story and it was certainly short. Other than that it was a total disapointment. Just don't waste your time. There was not character development or even romance. It was just a total waste of time and I was super disapointed.,0
Very well written with imagination and depth of character. Wrapped me in from beginning to end and fell in love with the characters. Steamy scenes and humor combine to make a definite winner of the book. Enjoyed every moment of it and look forward to reading more of the Gray Court.,1
It was a really short story but it was a really great book and I just loved it. BIANCA D`Arc did a really good job on this one.,1
Interesting story with plot changes non stop.several stories within one story but interrelated into one.of course you know the wife did it but he takes you through scenarios that may change your most mind.read in one sitting.,1
"This love story is delightful.  Ryan and Mariah , a workaholic father and a genius child,  are living a life devoid of real happiness.  Ryan wants to secure Mariah' s future, by making a fortune and having Mariah' s intellect developed.  Being at work and not spending time with Mariah, causes her to look for a mother.  Chance brings Kelsey into the father and daughter's lives.  Bringing these three people together makes their story an enjoyable and interesting  read.  The author,  makes each character  realistic. This was quick read because I could not put the book down.  I hope everyone will enjoy this much as I did.  True romance will always win with me.",1
"This book is somewhat difficult to  really become engrossed in.  The vocabulary contains a lot of words that, when looked up using that function on my Kindle, are listed as &#34;archaic&#34;.  When I have to stop and look up words, it disturbs the flow of the VERY improbable plot.",0
This book really pulls you in. I read it in one day. This book would be good for kids as young 10 but as an adult I really enjoyed the story line as well.,1
"This may be a great source, but I haven't learned how to work it. The formatting doesn't work the way I thought it would. It's probably just that I'm not very technical.",0
"Angel's Pawn is standalone prequel, set in the Singh's new Angel's Blood Guild Hunter world of vampires, angels and hunters. The Guild  hunters are human bounty hunters hired by angel masters to retrieve errant vampire servants attempting to skip out on the hundred years of service that is the price angels charge for immortality.Singh has carved out a nice little vignette for this story and she does a really good job of fleshing out her starring pair:  Guild Hunter Ashwini, who is dangerous and a bit on the crazy side, and Ashwini's favorite target, Cajun vamp Janvier who is her ally and not her prey for this hunt. Both these characters were wonderful and the flirtation between the two makes me hope that Singh won't wait too long to give them a full length novel of their own since Angel's pawn is just a tease for the pair and their relationship is left ` to be continued'.  This lack of closure for Ashwini and Janvier gives Angel's Pawn more of an urban fantasy feel than Singh's Psy-Changlings though.I happened to read Angel's Blood first  and I don't want to spoil that for you, but the one comment that I will make is that Angel's Pawn has a different feel than Angel's Blood - Angel's Pawn only hints at the darkness of this new series and the beauty, danger and cruelty that is part of the ancient angels' natures.  I liked Angel's Pawn and loved Singh's new and original world.",1
"I won't summarize the plot as this has been done by others. I will say-Solid writing, great price. This is a great story. For 99 cents-buy the book. It is a great story and for those of us who have read all there is to read by our favorite authors this is one that will introduce you to a new author.",1
"I want to start by saying this is a great cover. Sexy man in heart underwear clearly highlighting his ""attributes"" I mean what's not to like right. So without even cracking the cover it's off to a very promising start. The story is well paced, engaging and carries you seamlessly to the very last page. The relationship and interaction between the main charcters is natural, realistic and gets nice and steamy without dragging on too long in any one spot. I do wonder if anything will come of Suzanne and Stan seeing as there was mention of them meeting to discuss business and it stood out to me that maybe there could be more there?? Another book perhaps ;) In the end Lacy's adventurous side will balance out Gabe's more reserved side and they'll find their HEA. This was my first time reading Tori Scott and I'm definitly looking forward to reading her other books, cuz if there anything like this one I won't be disappointed!",1
"Having downloaded this book expecting to have a really good read, I was disappointed in how most of the story was depicted.There are some laugh-out-loud moments early on in the story, but after that things seemed to go downhill. I didn't like the heroine, because I thought she was a shallow twit. The hero was okay but a bit of a drongo in that he couldn't seem to realise that he had to actually have some training to run a department store.The romance was not convincing in that the characters hated each other, then liked each other and then hated each other again - and nothing had happened between them except - in time honoured fashion - a misunderstanding which could have been cleared up in two minutes. Of course that doesn't happen in romance books!The managers were unrealistic and silly. Far too many typos in this one and at one time the wrong name was used for a character!The premise was good, but unfortunately the script didn't maintain the fun of the first few chapters.",0
"It started out with great promise but I found it died too soon.  I found it predictable and wanted better character closure.  Well written, though.",0

Kate was orphaned as a toddler and never knew about her connections to the clan or it's genetic needs.When her new boss, Michael, meets her, he recognizes in her his mate, and soon realizes she has no knowledge of her biological past, and it will take everything he has to break through her psychic barriers.Heat factor hot.

"So this is totally over the top &#34;beef cake&#34; erotica.  Yes , I did finish it.  Yes, I think the author has done a pretty good job.  I did skim arts of it, however.  We meet a beautiful young woman that is saved by a caring older man via a platonic marriage. The opening scene is this h enjoying a dip in a river while unbeknownst to her, Devon, our H, is watching her lustfully from the trees.  The H is the son of her husband.  He was raised by his aunts after his mother died and the Father felt  unprepared to raise him by himself. Devon is later kidnapped and raised by a band of lawless men.  Devon is tough, dominant and ...yes...gorgeous .....and huge...in every way.....hence.....the cannon references.  As the story opens, Devon is on his way to see the Father he does not remember because he has been sent a message that the old man is dying.Devon,totally hot.  I dug his alpha ways and the sex scenes in which he is totally dom like.  I did feel sorry for the secondary male in the story, the doctor. There are some threesome scenes and the doc is more or less a foil to show how dom-like Devon is to the whole dynamic.I must admit, I read this book several weeks ago and cannot remember the heroine's name. Forgive me.  This is a long book. I paid a dollar for it and it is worth it.  The author attempts to make this more than just erotica by giving us a bigger story in which we follow the Hero on his trail ride to hunt and kill some fathomless bad guys.  This part I skimmed.  But  this is a sexy, erotic read if this is what you want.  Do not expect a deep introspective or thought provoking read.  But like choosing food from a menu, sometimes a light spicy snack is just what you need  and not a protein filled entr&eacute;e.",0
"First of all, I didn't like neither Danu nor Ragna. They both seemed so artificial. And the language they used was so stiff and official it was hard to believe they knew and loved each other for 500 years. Plus, the story was chaotic and a bit boring. I don't recommend it.",0
"I agree with the other reviewers. Don't waste your time. There is no ""story"" just sex, sex and impossible sex with food! Yuck! I may never eat fudge again! At least pretend that you have a story line and are not writting for Penthouse Forum. This one is getting deleted from my Kindle!",0
this book is fun and exciting has some really hot scenes with the characters couldn' ask for more. Very easy read,1
"I'm sorry to say, but I could not get past 6% of this book, on the Kindle. I'm not sure how old the author is, but I've seen 5 Year olds with better vocabulary. Most sentences consist of 4-5 words... like I really like to fight. She jumped from the window. I look great. ... the whole book is written like that, to add, the the first several pages, consist of the main guy, telling us all how great and hot he is.... and what's with "" I was beat up a lot as a kid, cause of my blond hair."" Do what? Oh, and I'm a bad ass, mixed martial arts fighter, undefeated, yet when some girl comes running towards him and jumps in his arms, he is nearly knocked off his feet, losing his balance.... Makes me wonder who he's been fighting... hahaha...Perhaps the book gets better, after a while, but I just can't bring myself to continue to read.... and I add, I hardly ever do not finish a book... it's bad. I'm glad I didn't pay for this, that's for sure.",0
"On the Edge will keep you on the edge of your seat as you read this hot story by Kallysten. On the Edge is a short story about a couple, where Brett is the owner of the On the Edge Club and has an apartment above the club with his silent partner Lisa.  Although the club is new in town, it is an instant success as humans and vampires gather to party together.Lisa, a vampire goes down to the club to party and feed. Leo, a vampire from her past appears and she brings him home to play with Brett and her.  Brett is surprised that he likes what the three of them do together. The next morning Leo isn't sure how Brett will feel but the surprise ending made this a perfect short story.  On the  Edge may be short but it is packed with emotion and lots of hot vampire sex.The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review.  The views expressed in the review are my own.",1
Once again Diana Bold has written an enjoyable story full of rich complex characters. You can't help but root for the hoydonish American and her straight-laced British hero. I enjoy how all of her stories have a different approach to romance. She writes with the same intriguing tone and yet none of them mimic the other except in her broad range of storytelling.Emma has come to London with one purpose in mind--use her over generous dowry to win a titled husband. She is determined to fulfill her mother's dying wish to show the American society who shunned her that she could land a peer. She is equally determined to find a man for herself. A man she could love. Michael is in need of an heiress. But will he be able to handle this fire-branded American? Will he be strong enough to let go of his British reserve for the love he has always longed for?I fell in love with her secondary characters as well. Emma's father was my favorite character--he cut to the chase which I loved. Jane was another favorite of mine and I believe her story strengthened the book instead of detracting from it. Altogether it was another solid story by Diana and I will look eagerly for the next in this series.,1
"A short story ~ Perhaps 5 or 10 minutes worth of time.  A sweet interlude between two people who have been crushing on each other for some time.  Although the story makes mention of a goody bag full of sex toys, only one makes its way into the story.  This really should be hotter for such a brief encounter or a few pages longer to develop the romance (or at least finish the weekend).",0
Brenda Novak never ceases to amaze me. I find myself reading til all hours of the night. I highly recommend her books.,1
"I decided to read this because another reviewer likened it to Kitty Thomas's Comfort Food, which I really enjoyed....I didn't enjoy this one though- not at all.  The main thing I detested is that you never get into the minds of the captors- they're all portrayed as hardened sadists with no compassion.  There's a lot of punishment and not much insight in to the characters personalities (or lack there of) or motivations.  Comfort Food gave me a lot to think about...this one went out of my mind immediately, thankfully.",0
"This is a mildly pleasant read with a predictable plot.  It is not as good as Ruck's first book, but better than &#34;In Her Shoes.&#34; This author is not a bad writer, but her plots need to have a little more substance. The book cover should never be better than what is inside.",0
"Story was predicable and short but for all that was sweet.  Yes there is sex, and some pretty good sex too, but there was also the story of two people falling in love.  I would recommend this story for those that want a nice, quick story with some good sex and of course the happy ending!",0
"The Classmate Murders, by Bob Moat had me squirming deeper into my recliner and reaching for my bag of Oreos by the end of chapter one. Jim Richards, Moats fictional senior sluith, pulled me into his easy going, semi slothful life-style and made me feel comfortable and welcome in his parent's home, as he discovered that a classmate from forty years earlier had been murdered. Jim's  life of acceptance of growing old, and his prospects for the future not the best for a man his age, melted away in an instant of sentement and memory at the loss of his friend. Jim's mental gears start to turn slowly as he ponders why the dead person had reached out to him in her final moments of life: Him,the class nerd, him the shy unassuming class photographer, him, always invited, but never missed if he didn't show. A cunning and methodical mind is quickly revealed as he searches for answers. When the second classmate is murdered, Jim is up to his not-so-slim waist in mystery and intrigue, always two steps behind the murderer. When the body of a third friend shows up, Jim has picked up enough clues through bird dog tenacity,and a hound's sense of smelling out trouble,that he has a suspect in his sights and is zeroing in for the bust. Suddenly, the hunt turns and Jim is the target, possibly the next victim, or so he suspects, but the real target is the new love in his life, Penny, the girl that had a secret crush on Jim when they were in High School. Jim is caught off guard that such a beauty would have any interest in him, backin the day, and even now, when she reveals her long hidden secret of love for Jim. In spite of this new-found love late in life, Jim stays focused on finding the murderer. What happens next is close up tangles with the murderer, Shoot outs, high speed chases, close calls for Jim and Penny. The last chapter had me pacing my den floor, oreo crumbs trailed behind me, the sun peeking in through the closed blinds...thank God for sick days. By 9:00 A.M. I was downloading Moats,Show Girl Murders,with Jim and Penny in Las Vegas.",1
"I was not familiar with this story. With the movie preview I became curious so ordered the collection from Amazon, which presented the right price. The story line captured my attention the author took me one a great fantasy ride story after story.If you enjoy fantasy get this collection, the price is right.",1
"It's a short story. It implies a relationship about D/s, gives vague details, & doesn't really explain anything. I understood more about her family than about what was happening with her & Will. They did a couple of kinky things, I wouldn't really call it a lifestyle or D/s relationship. Almost more domineering than Dominant.I'm just not feeling it. I want more about Sean & Chad. I believe I know what happened with the fight. So I'm only gonna get the last novella. Hmmmm just checked price, added to my wishlist. If I'm feeling rich maybe later.",0
"Author Steve Peek has created a world that embraces many legends, werewolves, vampires, the like, as beings of an alternate dimension. Gates allow them passage to out world. Ancient humans had learned ways to shut those doors down, building such as Stonehenge, the Indian mounds of the Americas, and other such structures around the world. But as humans spread and built, those impediments were destroyed, weakening those lines connected worldwide.And a pack of Longclaws have found a way to cross over into our world. In their own dimension, they are far down the food chain. In our world, they are incredibly fast with claws protruding from hands made for slashing, cutting up their prey.In northern Alabama forests, cut off by a collapsed bridge and rivers swollen by the torrential rains, there will be a battle between the clan of longclaws and two families, the Masons, from a long line that watched the mounds for just such an event, and an old Indian woman and her granddaughter.Most excellent.",1
"The Amazon's Curse built on relationships and events that developed in The Vampire's Bride by Showalter. The book can stand alone but is so much better if you know the back story. My rating would have been different if I hadn't already connected with the characters while reading the previous book.The Vampire's Bride focuses on Layel, king of the vampires, and Delilah, an Amazon warrior. However, we are introduced to many other characters, including Zane & Nola. I was happy to find out how their story ended.I would not suggest using this book alone as an introduction to Showalter's writing. You'll be missing out.",1
"I really enjoyed this book. The characters are vivid, the mythology of the paranormal universe it is set in is interesting and compelling, the romance is fulfilling and the sex is great. But there were hints of so much more that just didn't get to be fully explored.I'm giving this book 4 stars because I really had fun reading it- DESPITE the fact that there seemed to be a hell of a lot more to the story than what I got. The book is definitely a romance- and I always enjoy a good paranormal romance, but there was just so much ELSE going on that it was almost a shame to spend so much time focused on the attraction between our two characters.I can't wait to read the second book, but I find myself drawn into the greater context of the world and hope to get more from the next books than just the romance. Lots of questions are left unanswered and the author makes interesting interpretations of standard paranormal mythos. I'd love to know more...Bottom line- good book. The story itself is fun. The characters are likeable and strong. The universe is interesting. I just wish it was maybe a little longer so that I didn't have to settle for all the HINTING Ms. Somers did at the larger context. It would be great to actually sink my proverbial teeth into more than just the romance...I'd love to see this series follow Tristan and Kennedy on their adventures, but something tells me later books will feature a different romance each time. That won't stop me from eagerly awaiting each one though!",1
"After a year of self imposed celibacy following her break up with her former master Jane Porter is ready to get back into the BDSM lifestyle.  She's not looking for a lifelong love or even a long term relationship but she'd love to find a master who can bring out the full extent of her passion.Even after all this time Jane is still hurt by Peter's betrayal and knows trusting anyone with her heart or body will not be easy.  Her best friend and business partner Lily accompanies her to a bondage-themed event that their business R.S.V.P. is responsible for setting up.  It's more than just networking for Jane though, it's her first foray back into the BDSM scene and she just hopes to find one man who appeals to her.Once they arrive at the party location, Lily and Jean Jacques settle into their non-interested attitudes despite the fact that the sexual tension between them is practically off the charts.  Jane's just waiting for Jean Jacques to toss Lily over his shoulder and show her just what she's missing.  Jane spends the evening hunting for a potential master for the night but no one's sparked an interest.  What she doesn't realize is that Antonio Villareal spotted her the moment she entered the ballroom and he has every intention of getting to know her - in every way possible.Antonio isn't having the best of luck when it comes to women.  Sure, he's rich, gorgeous and single but women are only after him because of what they'd gain by being seen on his arm.  He's looking for a submissive woman to share his life and has set his sights on Jane.  The only problem is she's told him upfront she isn't looking for a happily-ever-after.  Some really hot sex in the here and now will do wonders for her but anything further is more than she's willing to consider.  Will Antonio be able to convince her that she can have all the smoldering sex she could ever want if she'd just give him a chance?Dominique Adair's storylines are ones that I'm consistently drawn to over and over.  Her plots and characters never fail to draw the reader into the storyline while promising to seduce you with each heat filled scene.  In SEDUCING JANE PORTER we're introduced to Jane, a character who's love and trust was horribly abused yet she's brave enough to attempt another foray into the BDSM world.  Antonio is exactly the sort of master Jane desires - even if she isn't aware of it yet.  I eagerly read through this story and felt a profound disappointment when it came to an end.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
"So awful I couldn't finish it, and that rarely happens. Slow, uninteresting characters and a nonexistent plot made me delete it after the first few chapters. So many other books to try.",0
I like short stories and I think the author did a good job writing this story plus I found it very interesting. The story is short as advertised but once you start reading it you can't stop because it grabs your interest from the first page to the last page and this may make it seem shorter.I liked this book and considered it a good read.,1
I am becoming a fan of Rebecca Forster and this book was no exception. It was well written along with believable characters that drew me into their lives. I found the book to be very interesting and surprised by many of the turn of events which is what a good mystery should do. I plan on reading more of her books.,1
"These Indian Fairy Tales are just great.  I have several books about indian culture and this book fits right in with them.  Thank you, thank you, thank you....",1
"Luckily I downloaded this for free. But even still as a novella, I wasn't captivated enough to finish it. I just could not connect with the main female character which I found to be petty and immature. The reason the angel comes to her is because she casts a vengeance spell against her ex-boyfriend for cheating on her. Not exactly a reason to be drawn to someone when her head is so wrapped up in getting back at him.",0
pot line again mess up and why does the man have to wait until his is dead to meet her again.,0
Unfortunately was not a big fan of this one. I just don't understand staying in a marriage with someone you don't love knowing that they manipulated you into it. Plus the resolution was too quick with her forgiving him too soon. Just no.,0
I enjoyed the book greatly.  There could have been better editing.  I really liked the plot.  There is really not much more I can say about this book,0
"I just love Bella and Zsadist! I just wanna bottle them up and never let them go. After six books, I still look forward to the two of them the most. If my pure love for them wasn't enough, add those scorching sex scenes and you got a banger baby!!I love how this story focused solely on them. With exception for the chapter that gave us a brief view on the Doc, it was all Z and Bella with Nalla. They are the cutest little family, and who would have thought that Z would have been the first to carry on the line of Aghony and the aristocrats? Not me!It was like watching Z and Bella fall in love again. It also gave us an update and dose of reality as to where Z is in his recovery. He's not as far as I suspected at the end of 'Lover Awakened'.  He s struggling and with even more baggage.Even though Mary has paled quite considerably since 'Lover Eternal', the brothers never take a weak female. As such, it's good to see the fruits of Mary's labour and I always love it when she and Z get together. Whether learning or therapy, those two got a rhythm that no one else has with Z, not even Bella. Maybe it's her training, but Mary definitely knows how to handle him.I don't know T.W. and we might never see him again, but I love the man and what he stands for. His moment with his wife was precious, and was a slice of life outside of the supernatural, something that has been missing and slipping as this series grow.An update was also provided on the other members of the brotherhood, however minimal. Phury is back how I remember and respect him, even if he isn't fighting, and it was good to get back out in the field with the brothers. Their tactics and battles always fascinated and intrigued me. I loved 'Dark Lover' where we got more fighting than romance. There was plotting, scheming and failure. I secretly would have liked at least some action from Mr. D, but then again, this novel was about love, reconciling and building new bridges.I searched without seeing a book for Nalla, but I already love the young and anticipate spending time with her uncle Rehvenge in the next novel. Hopefully we get some more Bella and Z time from this, however small :)",1
"I very much enjoyed the story. Very imaginative with great characters, action, and suspense. The typos, incorrect words, and missing words were very distracting; sometimes having to guess what the author really meant to say. Have a friend proof read for pete's sake! And every text program I know has spell check. There is just no excuse for all the errors in this book! I do recommend the story though and I will purchase the rest.",1
"This isn't the only book of this nature by a long shot, I just don't get it.Basically, the idea is that David bailed on Ethan years ago because he had a thing for him.  So, Ethan puts together an elaborate ruse to get David on an island alone.  Then, he tells David that he doesn't get any food or shelter unless he submits to his whims, and that he can't leave.The author kind of tries to paint David as conflicted rather than completely against the idea, but really - it shouldn't matter should it?  Even if some part of someone wants someone else, they should still get to choose.  And no, having food held hostage while the other person gets you worked up and then pretends your final acquiescence is consent is not a real choice.I can't figure how anyone thinks this stuff is romantic at all.  BDSM is all about the submissive partner having the power to put a stop to the behavior or the relationship at any time.  Once you take that away, it isn't games between consenting adults, it is just bullying and abuse of power.  Bullying and abuse aren't romantic, even when the victim claims to be OK with it.  I spent the parts of this book that I managed to finish feeling awful for David, who was being bullied into doing something he did not wish to do.I do wonder why we've managed to reduce the prevalence of rape fantasies in m/f romance, but people still accept it in m/m romance.",0
I bought Mountain Mourning based on the low price on this kindle edition.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a murder mystery that held my attention to the very end.,0
"True the meeting of the lead characters is far fetched, and the dialogue is somewhat mundane, but the biggest annoyance is how the book just ends. I actually thought that the whole book didnt download! Not a page turner but an ok read.  Not much thought process is required with this one.  Can only wonder if the next installment picks up the pace.",0
"This series is well written and keeps your attention through all of the books.  The only thing I didn't like was that it ended.I would recommend it to everyone, young people and adults.",1
Weird book. I didn't like the way this book was written. It's book was very weird and sequence was weird.,0
"It was well written, belonging to a bygone era when people were more romantic in the way they spoke. I could relate to the fantasy/ dream, they have a way of intruding into the real world. But all over, I found the story too slow and staged, it was also too stretched to be interesting.",0
"I almost didn't buy this book because it has such a silly title - gives no information about the book and just sounds off.  But the book itself is much better!I loved meeting Jae, the 6'5 Korean and fiercely out journalist and Kelly a writer with secrets.  I really liked how these two men came together and jostled with the essential problem of trust and intimacy, and sharing all your quirks,  however odd.  I also loved Will the houseboy slut.  So the characters were well developed and felt real,  but it was the dialog which really worked for me,  I just loved their casual banter,  their witty conversation.  And I really enjoyed watching them fall in love.  I rate this a keeper and think it will be a frequent reread.  I'm going to keep an eye out for more Z. A. Maxfield books",1
This is a fun example of the timewhen writers were paid by the word and quantity was a living.,1
"I did enjoy this book but it's definitely more about the sex marathons between Lena and Luke than ""the plot"" that could kill them as Luke tries to save his people. The writing was decent and I did like the character of Luke but the story could still use some work. This edition could still use some editing and the author has the annoying tendency of constantly identifying the characters rather than switching to he or she after the first few times. It pulled me out of the story occasionally but it's not a major issue. The sex does tend to go on for a while but there are some definitely hot moments. The whole scene with Luke in his ""monster"" form was pretty ridiculous but it didn't ruin the entire book for me. I got a little confused with all the characters thrown into this story (obviously to set up future books in the series) with 5 best friends including Lena plus Luke and his 2 buddies I couldn't really keep up with who's who when they all got together. There's a small bit of action in the story but Luke's quest to make this movie doesn't actually happen in this story, I'm sure it's going to be prolonged over the course of the series so be warned this is definitely a story about Lena and Luke's relationship or sex life really than anything else. I feel the author missed an opportunity to expand on the life and world of the monsters but overall I liked it for what it was and it's definitely good if your just looking for a little steamy bit of escapist fluff.",1
"Psy-Cop is my favorite book series.  This one is one of the best.  It was well set-up and introduced some new characters into the Psy-Cop world.  Some I even like/hate at the same time, not an easy feat.",1
"This is not a criticism. Knowing (and loving) Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin as I do, it made the stories even more enjoyable for me.Just like Wolfe, Wistril is rotund, loves to eat, loves to drink beer, and spends his time reading. He also, just like Wolfe, says, ""Bah,"" ""Pfui,"" ""Flummery,"" and ""Confound it."" Not to mention they both bellow.Archie, as Kern, does all the legwork and gets all the best wisecracks.  He even takes a stack of papers out of his desk, just as Archie does.We had horrendous thunderstorms today, and it was a perfect time to lose myself in the land of Kauph with Wistril and Kern and all the gargoyles. Hoot (read it to understand).I only gave this book 4 stars because of minor editing and continuity errors. I would like to have given it 4.5.I will certainly read the next one.",1
The was ok not one of the better that I have read.  So the choice would be yours if you want to take a chance and read it,0
"This is not my first time reading this collection. I have the paperback copies that I have kept over the years. It is a totally engrossing set of books. Maggie Shayne is one of my favorite paranormal authors, one that I can be sure when I pick up one of her books, I will enjoy it.Wings in the Night, Part 1 contains six wonderful tales about the creatures of the night known as vampires. I read that Maggie's line of vampire stories are the original ones, the ones that came before. You will see they are people just like you and me. You'll fall in love at least once. Maybe more.If you like paranormal romance, get this collection. You won't be disappointed. All I was disappointed in was that I couldn't give it more than five stars. I am looking forward to obtaining more of her books for the Kindle or Nook.",1
"Yeah, not what I expected. I couldn't finish it. I don't think breast milk and sex mix.  Milking someone is not a turn in...",0
I have no idea what David Silva was thinking when he wrote this book. I'm a huge Silva fan but this was a waste of time and money. A depressing book that makes absolutely not sense.,0
it was too long and boring.  the hero and the heroine were perfect in a way.  it was hard to like the heroine.,0
Ok not really interesting to me but ok read a a Aa.  A. A done done done done done do,0
"I've read better. The story evolved way to quickly. The author did let you get to know the characters or develop the story. It was like BOOM I'm in love with some dude in my mirror. The villain was blah... Underdeveloped and beyond understandable psychotic. Martha was TOO understanding. It just read rushed . I'm all for lovely sex scenes but these were awful. The banter, pillow talk, ewe just all kinds of wrong. I will not continue this series.",0
"If you are a reader of the lost fleet, you have to get this book to see the conclusion of their journey. If you are starting out, you need to read all of the others in sequence.",1
"The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because it offers an original take on a familiar story.  It could have been so much better.  However, the sheer number of grammatical errors typos just detracts enormously from what would otherwise be a very good read.  The more I read, the more annoyed I get at the sheer carelessness and lack of attention to detail. I'm not quite finished book one yet, but the longer I read the less inclined I am to do so.  I've purchased book 2, but at this stage I'm not sure I'm going to make it to the end of this one.  If I see another sentence running on when it should have a full stop half way through I'm going to scream.  Years ago I used to write fan fiction, along with others.  We took pride in our efforts and had beta readers to clean up typos and grammatical errors and assorted plot problems.  Far too often I'm buying Kindle books on Amazon which appear to have been self-published for one reason; as a means to make a fast buck.  Enough! Take some pride in your work and stop presenting poorly presented crap to people!",0
The temporal vortex is an interesting idea but the story quickly becomes a farce of six or seven different groups running around an island killing each other.,0
I was looking forward to reading this book but I almost put it away couple of times in the first half of it. I never really grew to like the main character. Her urge to prove herself just fell flat. It seemed to me that she created all her so called problems just being bored and I was bored as a reader most of the time as well. There was a chuckle time to time but no LOL moments for me. I do not recomend.,0
"No spoilers or summaries.HIGH LEVEL: Quick, erotic read. Short on plot development, but HIGH on the LUST scale. (and we don't read these books for plot, really...) Characters are surprisingly vivid, magic is ethereal, but warm like a summer breeze. Sex is... well, I'll admit I groaned out loud more than once. No real violence, TONS of sex- no BDSM, but multiple partners.I'm a fan of Ms. Arand's ""Granite Lake Wolves"" series and decided to read other books she has out there and I've been pleasantly surprised, though the Wolves are still the better books- sweeter stories, deeper histories, better characters. This book has MUCH hotter sex, though.If you are looking for something to keep you warm at night or make that lonely day at the beach just a little more exciting, this is it.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. R.G. Alexander's steamy vampire/were/witch romance series:Regina in the Sun (Children of the Goddess)2. Vivian Arend'sWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1fun, light were-romance series3.

"This book was first book that I'd read from this author and I shall not be going back for another.  There wasn't enough story to really stay engaged with the characters.  Also, there didn't seem to be much chemistry between the main characters.  Save your money.",0
"While it is a shorter book it's much longer then other short stories I've read, thankfully. This has a really cool concept and isn't disappointing at all. Despite Nissa and Hex being the main characters I think I liked Aleron more then them. Anyway I thought it was good and worth time to read, plus it's free and so far one of the best free erotic novels I've read.",1
I would like to recommend this book to anyone who has a open mind. This is a good idea of the second coming of the Lord. This book will need to be read with a open mind,0
"I really like techno-thriller, action novels. But I would also like them to be believeable. I gave this book four stars for having non-stop action in spades - but to me the situations our heroes are thrown into seem so contrived that after the second time it happened I was just waiting to see what the author would come up with next.As for the ending, seriously?!",1
"These characters are not human. Humanoid, perhaps, but I'm really not interested in fantasy characters and I wish that the description had indicated that. I started the book, but the anger and bitterness was too much to deal with. It is a very dark retelling of a ""beauty and the beast"" type tale, except there really isn't any beauty anywhere.",0
"Alexa Daniels never dreamed that the gorgeous leather clad Harley rider that she had a roadside tryst with a few weeks ago would end up being Justin Winston with Winston Industries.  She was completely thrown for a curve when she faced him knowing this was the man she was presenting a proposal to on behalf of Therber Management Services.  She couldn't believe that he didn't even acknowledge meeting her before, and even told her he was pleased to meet her.  This presentation was too important, so she put on her game face and went on.  Alexa wasn't going to let him ruin this for her with his cruel games.When the meeting concluded, Alexa couldn't get out of there fast enough after confronting Justin about their steamy encounter.  She raced home to cool off, but as she gathered her briefcase from the car, a man grabbed her from behind and jabbed a gun in her back.  She tried to struggle and get away, but he had her.  Alexa thought it was over until someone came to help in response to her screams for help.  The next thing she knew she was in another car with a rugged looking Justin tending to her wounds, and the intense businessman she had just met driving.  She demanded to know what was going on, and was flabbergasted to learn she was in the presence of Jason and Justin Winston - twin brothers.What a steamy suspenseful ride!!  There is story with intense passion, and together that always makes a winner.  Jason is a strong controlled dominant man while his twin is laid back taking things moment by moment.  Jason and Justin know immediately that Alexa was the woman for them, but she has been hurt in the past, and isn't as easily convinced.",1
"I enjoyed this book, especially when the price was so low.  My only complaint would be that if you were not paying attention, all this time was passing by from one chapter to the next.  I had to go back and re-read it carefully to figure out that time had transpired from one event to the next.  Story is about Blake and Josephine, who knew each other from when they were teenagers.  She apparently had a crush on him and he never knew.  After highschool, he left the town and became a very rich, successful venture capitalist.  She grows up and becomes a fairly famous model.  Many years later, they run into each other at a party and they are instantly drawn to each other.  They begin to talk and to dance, soon things get heated and they indulge in a passionate one night stand.  After that, Blake leaves her without a word and doesn't attempt to contact her.  Josephine is disappointed and hurt, so when she found out he had gotten engaged, she married his cousin Luke shortly thereafter.Fast forward to a year, Josephine comes home and realizes her husband has left her. Blake goes to her and tells her what his cousin said before running away and she realizes she has nothing.  He took all her money.  Feeling destitute, Blake offers her a job and a roof to stay in.  They begin working together and she soon realizes she is good at the job.  Meanwhile, the attraction is still there and many months go by apparently.  One day they just can't take it anymore and become involved again intimately.  Will thire past get in the way? Will her feelings of betrayal and hurt resurface?  Can they make it into more than a fling?Story moved way too quick for me personally.  Character development was a bit lacking and you had to take things at face value, instead of living it as most good stories do.  Overall, quick and light reading, not in my keep pile.",0
"I like stories about couples who reunite but I found this one a bit boring. I thought the reason they split in the first place a bit odd when Mandy could have easily gone to school where Kip went to play Hockey.I didn't really connect with the characters of Mandy or Kip. I found Kip going through his box of memories from his time with Mandy a bit girlie. Even his messages to her on facebook were a bit girlie. He wasn't very manly for a hockey player!I got bored reading it. Yes it has some sex scenes but there was just something about how it was written that didn't hold my attention. OK for a freebie, but doesn't make me want to read more by this author.",0
Things are moving along for  love birds a house to sell solve a. Murder and buy a new house.  This book was a nice hot afternoon break.,1
"The early stories are quite well done, but later in the book there are many I gave up on because they are revoltingly violent and/or not very interesting.  I would have quite liked to read more stories featuring the Jack Daniels character.",0
It was available for free on kindle so I just bought the book. The book has two many words that make no sense at all. The story seems complicated and going nowhere . I felt a bit disappointed. Not recommended.,0
"I would like to think that I am capable of suspending my skepticism and enjoy a good escapist romance, and that was how I felt the majority of this book. Unfortunately by the end things just got way too out of hand for me to continuing making excuses for the story. The story was somewhat cute but the title should have been a major indication of the style of writing. If the author seriously couldn't come up with anything more creative for a title other than Touchdowns and Potions, you really can't have the highest expectations for the writing and plot line (my mistake), because that was literally what the story was, a football player and a girl with a love potion.This could have been a interesting story and I do commend the author for avoiding a lot of cliches but there was little to no character development and within a span of a few pages (spoiler alert) everything is perfect, then Andy is a liar, Jenna conveniently has a voicemail for a job in Texas, airline ticket provide and all (IN A MESSAGE BEFORE THEY EVER SPOKE WITH HER) so she's off to the airport, and then Andy's slimy football teammate is trying to rape Jenna in the middle of no where. If you're reading this a pulling a double take, yeah that just happened.For the price it's not bad and if you can suspend your disbelief, go for it, but the writing was mediocre and repetitive and characters were incredibly one demensional. The only semi-redeeming element was Jenna's relationship with the ""meddling older woman"" but even that is pretty ridiculous. Sorry to burst anyone's bubble but I was definitely not loving this book.",0
"The main plot of the story wasn't too bad. The part that was confusing was the age of the character.  Although the main characters were over the age of 60 a lot of times I found them acting like people my age (37) or younger.  Also, I am somewhat tech-savy, but was a little put off by references to outdated gadgets.  I actually had to Google what a Palm Treo was.  This book is probably best for people over 60.  I also found it to be a very hard hard.  It seemed to take me forever to get through it.",0
"Want to know what I hate more than insta-love? No character development AND insta-love. Granted I suppose I was kind of asking for it by reading a novella that includes romance but still it's something that just makes me cringe.The author does have a fairly nice writing style and the idea overall is decent. I think if Bevill had spent more time developing the story and exploring the characters this could have been a pretty good read, but as is...it's just a rushed romance with a side of whimsy. In fact it's mostly romance after the two main characters meet, and some of it just came off as ""I'm confessing my love the second I meet you to progress the storyline quickly.""It's okay if you are looking for a short read and nothing deep but don't go into expecting too much. I'll only read the second if I ever need a quick read to fill time.",0
"Mark Clodi really knows how to creep you out: this time try escaping from a hospital with newborns.He gives unique traits to his creatures and pits them against interesting humans. Highly entertaining, can't wait for the next one.",1
Loved this book and all the charactersThe story flowed perfectly from scene to sceneMake it into a movie,1

I just didn't love it.  It bordered on abusive and I really didn't like the sharing without her permission BEFORE hand!  Just not worth my time.,0
"This book by Smith-Ready is ont that will catch your attion because it is so unusual. The plot is out of this world, almost, because it deals with things that are out of this world, almost. The characters are interesting and the plot has some very good points and some not so good. I did like the book.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'""",0
"I fell in love with the title and blurb. This story had the potential and would have made a helluva sexy and amazing story if not for the length of the story. It is very very short. The ending was so abrupt as well. When I got to the end of it, I thought there was an error while downloading! I really really wished it was longer. With such a short length, the development of the characters and story just isn't satisfactory.The characters are compelling and have a story behind them. I enjoyed how Bailey is submissive yet not a doormat, she is independent; unlike most BDSM stories where the submissive just seems so submissive, it's kinda irritating. I also love that Bailey runs a bakery and is a curvy woman, yet isn't bothered by it. As you can tell, I love Bailey!One thing I didn't like was how Aiden kept running away, and then returning, and then running away again D&#60; It gets irritating. Like dude, you're a dom, make up your mind and stop sending mixed signals. Plus there is no absolute HEA as well, so I'll classify this as a short, intense hot read.",1
"I don't know that I have ever read a book where there was so little communication between the characters.  The hero just wants the heroine out of there, because she is too ""human"" and doesn't know anything supernatural.  The heroine is just stupid.  She never catches on to anything that is going on around her-she has a lot of curiosity, then is scared and can't think for most of the book.  She is entirely run by her emotions.  Do they do the job they have to do? No.  Does she ever get into her ""powers"" and discover what she can do? No.  Did they even train her for what she had ahead of her? No. Even the secondary characters of a witch and her niece (also a witch) are either completely uncommunicative, or just don't know what is going on (a witch, really?)  It was amusing to see the hero describe the heroine as ""kickass"" and then she just falls apart.  Several times.  Oh yes, and the whole back story was never revealed. What was the problem between the hero and the secondary guy?  We got hints, but that was all.  The other problem with this book was that it was just too wordy.  The same things over and over-the author probably could have cut out about a third of the book and it would make just as much sense.  It had promise, it just never delivered.",0
I enjoyed this series author did a decent job of keeping my interest hay hay hay hay hay hay hay,1
I thought this book was really good even tho there is a lot of m/m scenes in it.  I liked the characters but some of the things they did our said were kind of cheesy.  Overall the book was a good read.,1
"Wild hearts is a really good short story, fast and easy read. I loved the characters and the story line. Really great book.",1
Loved this Dragon knight series can get pretty wet sex scenarios throughout the book and series so be prepared.  Love and sex plus suspense and drama.,1
"This is a review of the Kindle version - which I picked up for free.This is the start (first couple chapters really) of Zyra Zanr (what a name!) a futuristic bounty hunter.  Zyra is a stone cold killer and racks up a sizable body count in under 550 location (even fewer than this, as an excerpt is included from a novel).If you want closure, well, it isn't here.  It's a good start to a science fiction story, but the main purpose is to introduce Zyra and get you to buy the author's book.  Give it a shot if you like science fiction, but I wouldn't pay for this.",0
"Okay. So I was wanting a tasteful (excuse the pun) story. What this story is BEYOND. I mean, in my opinion, just filth. Is there a negative rating?",0
"As usual, this chapter in the Zombie Chronicles was great. I'm glad that Clodi decided to tell Hank n Juan' s story and, even though he said at the end of this book that their story would not be continued, I see elsewhere that there will be a book titled Undead Advantage 2, so I am hoping that he has had a mind change about that.  Now I'm off to see if there are anymore that I have not read and am praying that he is almost ready to release book five of the main series. Hope so.... I am not a very patient person. Smile!",1
"I have read some books where the heroine in the novel was totally clueless and fickle, but this woman got on my last nerve. I wanted to catapult her into some non-existant time warp.  If I were Cristian, I would have left her there and said, laters babe...",0
Read these books after seeing the movie.The structure of some of the books makes it difficult to read. The plot is adventurous and fun if youa wanted to know what happened after seeing the movie.,0
3 out of 5 stars. I have yet to read the other books in this series but if this one is like the others then I have high hopes for it. It's a sweet tale about the meaning of love and what you are willing to do to pull through during the difficult times.Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog),0
"Great characters, good plot, very engaging. It's not literary fiction, but it's perfect summer escapism, and fun to read about the world of high fashion.",1
I have been trying to go through the classic books off and on through out the years. I have found many of them so interesting and refreshing. This book was no different. It has great characters and a wonderful story line. I recommend it if you enjoy a bit of sci fi-ish books. :),1
I bought this book by accident but was like what the heck. Its only 2 bux. But I was still disappointed. The characters were both weak minded and pathetic. And the sex scenes? Boring. If you like books about characters in love but with no trust then this is the book for you.,0
"I picked this book up for free quite some time ago, and finally had the time and the urge to read it. It's professional in presentation, and I found few errors, so I was impressed with that. I'm not thrilled with the cover art, but that is more a matter of taste than any failing on quality. This book would look good next to a big six book on the shelf. It's worth paying for, and I'm shocked to see that it is still available for free. So is the sequel. Wow.First of all, be prepared for a long read. Granted this isn't a 1,000 page monstrosity like some fantasy books that come out, but it is well over 600 pages, so it's a healthy read. Personally, I would have broken it into two books. At 52% a major plot line resolves, and while the overall &#34;evil&#34; is still around, the book could have easily finished up at this point, and the rest of the overarching plot could have been resolved in a second book.There's quite a lot of decent action, and the bad guys are suitably bad. I think the good guys could have been a bit more competent, or at least have more than one or two people who could actually do anything. I realize we want the heroes to appear properly heroic, but I felt at time that the population was so lacking that they almost deserved to get slaughtered. The trials that the main hero and heroine undergo are impressively trying though, so that was nice.I'd actually call this a 3.5 star rating. It's good enough that I will be reading the sequel, but as it is also over 600 pages, it will have to wait until I'm up for something that long.",0
This book did not grab me at any time.  I was able to pick the killer at the early part of the story and found the end very unsatisfactory.,0
"I was not fond of the way the story was told. Like I was on the outside looking in. The reader gets told how each character feels. It got tedious for me. The first half of the story wasnt that bad, but somewhere around the 50% mark it started to get really bizzare.Plot: Basically this is a story about 2 people who are wildly attracted to each other each with their own hang ups. She has a fiance out of state whom she ""thinks she will grow to love in time."" He has a dead fiancee and a sister that dies mid story.  The title made me think I might get porn, while the cover art suggested romance so I gave it a try. The writing- with its God references peppered through out- made me think this might be an ""undercover"" Christian book. You know the kind where the author is out to prove that a story can be secular, but still clean enough for the prude reader? It wasnt.Characters: Trevor is a 25 year old fashion designer and he's not gay? Panzina is 21 with the life experience of a thirty year old. She has raised her fiances 4 year old son since birth- despite the fact that said fiance seems pretty absent. And when she gives up the son to the biological mother- there is no sadness or loss beyond one paragraph. And if the story is chronological- she doesnt see the son more than once in 6 months after giving him up.I know absolutely nothing about the author, but I am inclined to say that Patterson is quite a few decades past 21 and 25. Her characters have experiences and world views far beyond the typical 20 something. Also her 25 year old millionaire came from a very poor family- he made his fortune pretty fast and he's still pretty grounded. Normally- he would still be in the drugs, alcohol, and models stage if he was a real guy.Writing: there are times when I thought Patterson's first language wasnt english. There were several phrases that no young person would say, we arent raised to be stilted and formal. Ex) ""What do you have a taste for?""Her writing is flowery and over the top at times; ""It meant that he desired her company, craved it more than the delicious sushi, which he described."" Or ""She was such a passionate woman that incidents like this could permanently mark her heart."" Or ""his eyes appraised her figure with admiration."" Patterson tells us how her characters feel constantly using the most creative language she can find: ""She felt dreary as she walked up the front steps"" and ""her emotions churned in turmoil.""What I mean by bizzare: Panzina is engaged, yet she hardly thinks about Telvin. She has no problems holding hands, kissing and fondling Trevor, yet she plans on being a virgin on her wedding night. Yeah, Patterson over plays the pure, good girl thing. Then in a really weird twist, she gives herself as balm when Trevor's sister dies and her needs ""comfort"" saying, ""She forgot about her fears, reservations and promises made. Trevor had been there for her when she neeeded someone desperately. It was only right to be there for him in his time of need. She wouldnt be a virgin on her wedding night, but at least her first time would be with a man whom she truly loved.""Also- Patterson couldnt keep track of her own world. Trevor's ""penthouse"" has a driveway, patio, and full sized pool. Characters can walk up to the door. Forgive me, but I have always been taught that the penthouse is the top of a highrise or appartment building. And Trevor hates coffee yet he orders it. How do I know he hates coffee? Because Patterson has her characters have a several paragraph conversation about how he wont drink it because it tastes like dirt.But the icing on the cake of bizarre for me is when Panzina has the epiphany, ""Trevor might like me if I finally break off my engagement."" Yeah, she was a total ditz. I have zero respect for Panzina. She was the kind of woman that I ridicule on a regular basis.Would I recommend it: No, not unless you are super into drama and soap opera style characters are your thing. Personally, I like rational characters that I might befriend if they were a real person.",0
"It's a short story and I am glad it was free.  I wouldn't have even bothered with it if I had to buy it.  This is first class mommy porn, enough said.",0
If you want really good sci-fi then get this series.  I started and finished the series in a week I liked it so well.  It is rare for me to do that.  Granted the cover art is very very poor but please (lets trot out the old saw) don't judge a book by it's cover!  Also it is a steal at the kindle price.,1
"As a lifelong Christian (I was raised in a Christian home, was saved at 8 yrs old, never known a time in my life where I didn't know Jesus) I've experienced some very hurtful things in churches in the past. The church I was saved in had a business meeting in order to fire one of the pastors. My parents supported all the pastors but we were in the minority. The meeting became very heated until finally we had to run out of the sanctuary. People became ugly fast and chased us, even shooting a gun into the air in the church sanctuary. They literally ran us out of town. We moved and my parents joined the First Baptist Church but didn't attend church very much and finally not at all. They didn't lose their faith in Jesus Christ but they lost faith in the church (and my Mom was the daughter of a minister). As a teenager, I began attending a small church with some friends but the older people of the congregation resented being overrun with teenagers. It disrupted their placid spiritual life so they fired the preacher and all the teens left that church. My husband and I joined a church in 1983 and attended until 2009. We were very active. But of all the pastors that went through our church, I could probably count on one hand the ones that didn't abuse the congregation in one way or another. Finally, we had a straw-that-broke-the-camels'-back event and we left our church. Needless to say I'm gun shy now! We've been visiting churches all over our town but haven't found a match yet. I think I might like one but only to get anxious that we would invest our time, money and selves into a body that has the same problems. It takes awhile before you get to know the church, policies, leadership, congregants enough to know if all is well or something is rotten in Denmark. I had almost made up my mind to be like my parents and just drop out of the church scene and worship God in my own way. Then I read this book. I think the book's description is right on the mark so I won't repeat it. But, since I started reading this book, we've started visiting more churches and praying that we find one soon.",1
This book is witty and fun from the first page to the last. I highly recommend it. I'm looking forward to more from this author.  And there is a sequel.,1
"I had really hard time to focus on the story,the book is hard to read and there is  no good flow therefore after few chapters I deleted it.",0
I really did not like this book.  It's premise is one character has intimate dreams about a person and place for two years until he finally finds the house and the man that lives there.  Supposedly the house is alive and drew him there because of the sadness of the man that lived there and the fact he was letting the house fall apart by not keeping it up.  Mostly the book is angst and sex with a small story thrown in to tie it together.  I would have not liked Marek the guy that lived in the house at all. He was a whiny needy jerk.  I liked Colin but he wasn't a very strong character and was in love with Marek before he met him because of his dreams.,0
"I enjoyed the story and David's parallel story lines were easy to follow.  However, it was clear that he has little &#34;real&#34; experience in shipboard life or with military structure and command personalities.  All of his characters are exagerated stereotypes and the interpersonal exchanges would have resulted in few of these protagonists ever reaching command because of the obvious psycholoogical abberations present.One sure indicator of his unfamiliarity with naval (spaceship or surfaceship) life is his lubberly use of &#34;the&#34; before ship names.  We who have spent many years and many deck watches know that a manned ship is truly a living entity, christened at its birth (launching), and possessing the nature and personality of its officers and crew.  Use of &#34;the&#34; before its given name is akin to referring to this book's author as &#34;the David Derrico.&#34;Also, as Isaac Azimov pointed out repeatedly, good science fiction must be good science.  I was appalled when the good Admiral referred to &#34;a new element&#34; as part of the alien hull.  Any &#34;new element&#34; in this universe would necessarily be very unstable with a half life measured in nano-seconds so can't be fairly used withhout first laying the appropriate background work.  Without that, this becomes only fantasy and not credible science fiction.",0
the book didn't seem to really go anywhere. It didn't make since that all this attraction was held at bay for so long and the just went crazy,0
"Wish that this anthology had more of the Fuzzy books, which I love. They are , by far, his best works.",1
This was to short. I will not be telling my friends bout it. I did not like the topic of the story.,0
Gosh I did not like this book at all. I wish I could have got my money back. I felt like I was reading a book my 12 year old little sister wrote.,0
"I think this started out well and was well written.  It lost me on how fast the female agreed to their plan.  All I got was how attractive these two were.  Other than sexual there seem to be a lack of chemistry--it was just sex.  I just think they move too fast and if they wanted to keep things quiet, the three should have waited to have sex after they got back to the ranch.  As for the little suspense added about the female being afraid of her previous employer's son coming after her, well the man was not going to follow this woman because he was disowned.  This was back in the day and it wasn't like the son could hop on a plane, train, or greyhound--he should've been broke, anyway.",0
"I don't like giving bad reviews but this book I didn't give a fair go really. So, really, I can't say much about it.",0
Great read enjoyed every minute of it .  I think it answers some questions that are out there about this series.,1
This is  one of the worst books I have ever read.  It was so bad I did not even finish it.  All it is is one big whining session by the supposed main character to her sister.  Don't bother buying it.  I actually deleted it off my Kindle!,0
This is one you can skip. Story line weak and characters not really developed. One of the few readers books I haven't really enjoyed.,0
"The traumatic meeting of Emerald Sandford and Asher Wellingham, Duke of Carisbrook occurs five years before the story begins, when she's the 16-year-old member of her nobleman-turned-pirate father's crew and he's the 26-year-old captain of one of his merchant ships. Discovering she's female, Asher refuses to fight her, because, even when beseiged by pirates, a gentleman never harms a lady.  Emerald repays him by knocking him overboard and out of harm's way, not knowing this will make Asher the pirates' captive. It eventually loses him the use of his right hand and his brother his sight. Asher escapes and returns to wipe out the stronghold and kill her father and this is where the story begins. Emerald follows him to England. It isn't for revenge but to retrieve her father's walking stick he took because inside it is the map to a treasure she can use to pay off Beau Sandford's debts and free herself from the past.Using her father's family name and right to a title, Emerald becomes Lady Emma Seaton. Naturally Asher's suspicious of her and intrigued because of her obvious lies and uneasiness in high society. Of course they fall in love but this is more an in-depth study of the main characters attitudes than a mere will-they/won't-they love story. Asher is bound by duty and honor...and extreme guilt. His wife died while he was seeking his revenge, his brother was blinded during his rescue. He returns to his family home a widower, disabled in body, but more disabled in spirit, blaming himself for the tragedies occurring during his own travail. Emerald meanwhile sees herself as the cause. If she hadn't knocked him overboard, none of this would've happened.  Still pursuing her hunt for the walking stick, she believes the only way she can repay Asher for the misery she  has caused is to become his mistress and give him back  the love he lost and remove his grief over his brother's condition.It's an interesting story and an entertaining one, sensuous in spots, but staying away from the ballrooms and usual locales for such tales with most of the action taking place at Asher's estate. Flashbacks give reasons for everything that happens instead of playing them out in detail. Though this is the only James' novel I've read, I got the feeling there may be more on this family because of various hints given. If so, I'd like to read them,too.Harlequin Historical #888This novel was a gift to the reviewer and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1

"First off I understand this was supposed to be a short story so I shouldn't have expected too much but, if you give your main character a background that involves her family being murdered by a vampire, you don't have the main character jump into bed with a vampire as soon as she can. That's unrealistic. If this was a story with only humans, that would be like saying the man she became involved with is related to the killer who murdered her brother. You can't tell me she's not going to have some pent up anger and that her lust is going to make her forget all about her grief. Like I said unrealistic.",0
"Empowering.... That is the word i think, for me, describes Fated by Lauren Dane! We get to feel and go through everything with Megan and Shane. The roller coaster of emotions and the fight for them to make it. Megan is a strong and fierce character and something all of us women should dominate in our own personal lives. It was captivating to see the main male character, Shane, to be the person to have the fears and anxiety of everything that was going on and surrounding him. But for this book, that was a refreshing change. I loved finding out about Shane's family history, which helped explain the reasons and fears he had. Me personally, i will be grateful for all the little snippets that Lauren Dane gave us for the other members of The Warden Clan in Fated. It has been a pleasure finding out what they are doing, where they are in their lives and how much they have changed an adapted. Once again, Fated is a 5 star book that i will recommend to anybody and everybody.",1
"After reading the reviews I was prepared for a really bad read. I've read worse. Like the other reviewer said, it's erotica, so you expect all the sex. It wasn't great, but it was worth the price. Free is always good.",0
"It's hard to write a review of this book.  It was engaging, creative, full of action, and relatively memorable.  Well worth the kindle pricing.Yes, it's fantasy....a sort of dark version of the standard kid grows up and learns how to fight battles and perform sorcery, but it was also deeper than that and more honest/humble/simple.Perhaps, the best summary was that this book could have formed the basis of an amazingly good story, but it does go by fast and to truly appreciate character development...there would need to be much more.The writing was in the background...one hardly noticed it was there.  Perhaps another years worth of editing and reviews and it would have easily made 4 stars for me...as it is I'm trying to avoid givingtoo many 4 stars to many great books out these days, and I rarely give 5, so while this is probably a 3.8...I'm putting in 3 on the amazon meter.Either way, for the price.....an easy choice to buy and well worth the time.",0
"I had to stop reading the after only 25% of it read. The plot was so totally predictable and the characters portrayed as being so stupid that I finally had to put it down.  If you read my other reviews, you'll see that I don't usually write negative ones.SPOILER ALERT But a Pentagon employee who thinks that information regarding the transport route and personnel involved in the moving of military weapons is harmless enough to sell to Middle Eastern male, who is described as looking like one,  for $10K....Really????? And that is just one of the situations the reader needs overlook to continue reading.  I just couldn't do it.",0
I am so excited to get this book finished. It's been on my to be read shelf since I got my first nook almost two years ago. The story of Emma and Dean seems a bit dark in places and both of them keep stumbling over their own baggage and insecurities. In some ways they are their own worse enemies. It's easy to see where the title from the story comes from because there is plenty of angst in this story. But the HEA does make the story a worthy read but it does feel good to get something off my list that has been there a while,0
let down. Did not think it was worth the money spent at all. Nothing in it seemed of real value.,0
I enjoyed reading this book.  Its unusual twist at the end was a surprise.  It was easy reading with not too many characters to remember.,1
"The first six or seven reviews for this author/series read like what you'd expect from a 6th grade class required to turn in book reports. Set next to classic dragon stories - McCaffrey, Weis, Yolen to name just a few - it's laughably poor writing and structure. The characters are flat, the plot passive, and the ""series"" isn't worthy of the title. Reads like a first effort that should have been set aside as a practice piece, while the author went on to better things. Even 6th graders are entitled to better writing.",0
"This was a great deal, especially when you get 4 books in one. I loved everything about these stories. All the stories had great characters; characters that were all so believable. I also loved the way the towns people interacted with one another on a daily basis. They all genuinely cared about one another like they were all one big happy family, rather than just being some acquaintance that just happens to live near one another. They all cared for one another deeply, they looked after each other on a daily basis and if someone was down on their luck, then they all pull together & they'd find a way for them to over come those obstacles in the way.I suppose it's because they live so far from civilization that they have to pull together, if they want to survive in that kind of wilderness.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!",1

So many good stories in this collection. Konrath is the master story teller with a vivid imagination and can create a well rounded fleshed out character in just a couple of paragraphs.,1
"This book is a deserving winner of the prestigious Giller prize in 2008.  I've been wanting to read it for some time, but wanted to read Boyden's first book ""Three Day Road"" first.  As good as that book was, this one is even better.  But it was good to read Three Day Road first as it is a precursor to this one and helped me understand the characters a bit more.  Like Three Day Road, this book is so difficult to read in some ways because you keep waiting for the terrible, cataclysmic thing to happen.  And even though you know it's going to happen, it doesn't make it any less terrible when it does.  This book is also similar to Three Day Road as it told from the viewpoints of two different people.  Both Will and his young niece Annie have terrible stories to tell and each heals through the sharing of them.  I highly recommend this book, but I would suggest that you read Three Day Road first.  You will feel richer from the experience of enjoying superlative story telling.  Both books will take you up and out of your everyday life and into a magical world that seems so very real while you are there reading about it.",1
Not to bad for a free read. It was short and not too much to it. Maybe give it a try since its free...,0
"This was a fast paced tale.  It started off so innocently in the Holy Land with a pleasant trip with just a hint of something wrong.  Greg's  senses were picking up little nuances, but couldn't quite put a finger on what was bothering him.  Just too many coincidences.  After they got home, the fun started.  With Jill kidnapped he had to pull out all the stops and call in every favor he could.  As this is the beginning of the series, it made you think a little harder.  Loved the relationship and the genuine love between them.  A great read.  Recommend reading all this series.",1
"Can't say I've subscribed yet, but I have picked up an occasional issue of Reader's Digest on the Kindle.  It's a good mix of light feature pieces (an entertaining profile of actor Pierce Brosnan was a good read) and long, detailed investigative articles (good one on the airline industry in the same issue).  You also get actual captioned cartoons (a rarity on the Kindle!) and other fun elements.You also get another bonus.  If there's one criticism I have of Kindle blogs and magazines, it's visual sameness.  The New York Times looks like Newsweek which looks like The Philadelphia Inquirer, etc.  But Reader's Digest on the Kindle looks like, well... Reader's Digest.  You get the sharp, catchy graphics of the print edition (with the headline and sub-headlines of a story often embedded within the main photo just like in the regular magazine), and other pieces of visual flair- like the cartoons mentioned earlier- carried over from the magazine, too.  I guess it's a small point (as content is really the most important thing), but it's nice seeing a Kindle magazine that looks truly different from other Kindle magazines.  With luck this will be the beginning of a trend.But, yeah, give an issue a shot.  Even if you usually read weightier fare on your Kindle, you may just find the content and visual flair of Reader's Digest on the Kindle to be an occasional refreshing change.Note: Amazon frequently updates the presentation and functionality of Kindle blogs and periodicals, so as this review gets older, it may no longer accurately describe the current version of this product.",1
Meh.  This one really sucked which is odd because Bond is usually very good.  I've loved almost all her books.,0
"If you enjoy M/M action, then you may like this book. Me, not so much. I truely wish the book descriptions were clear on this. I have a few Delilah Devlin books on my keeper shelf, but this is not one of them. I love her paranormal Immortal Knights series, but she seems to be expanding her story ideas. Male on male is so not my thing! And the repeated image of (how do I say this nicely?) two men in one hole has me cringing. Unfortunately she has been using this scene/act in a lot in her other books as well lately. Sorry Delilah, sexy it is not!",0
"I kept reading trying to get the plot of this book, but I finally got tired of it and quit! I am not sure why some people are saying they are short novels! Maybe the last 3 are but the first one ""At the back of the North wind is very long 1332 pages. I am trying to get through this book again, and so far there is no mention of spiritual things so I'm not sure why it is called a christian book! It is a odd story about a little boy who travels with the north wind and tells stories. I'm not finished with the book yet so I will update this post when I do!",0
"Well, the book itself is a very short story. I didn't liked it. The ending is simply ....ended. No thriller, nothing extraordinary. Too common to tell the true and too much religion.",0
"Tequila Truth is about three best friends who decided to have one weekend full of sex.  Kylie has lived with Colt and Heath as a roommate, but her thoughts have drifted to other fantasys about them at times.  Colt and Heath, have also had thoughts about her, but since all three of them are just best friends and roommates, neither act on their thoughts.  Kylie is just one of the boys to them, but things change when one night Colt finds Kylie tied to her bed, being wiped by her date.  He gets upset the guy was hurting her and decides she needs to be with someone she trusts.  He and Heath talk and offer to give her a fantasy weekend full of sex.The book had some really good sex scenes in it.  The three of them instantly were comfortable with their threesome.  At times I was laughing at some of the silly things that were said and how quickly things changed from best friend status to forever status.  The book was okay.  The ending was a little farfetched, even for fiction.  I'd like to read a sequel and find out if everything turned out like they planned.",0
"hot hot hot,  four amazing stories four charming men. i have read two of the paperbacks before. and was looking forward to reading them again. and i dont do that as a rule. they were great and nice to have in my collection.",1
"This is book 1 in the series and it was a fun (and a little out there) read.  There was a lot of hot sex (M/F, M/M, M/M/F) but also a storyline that can carry on to the other books.",1
Heat of the Moment may be short but it certainly packs a punch and is a very hot introduction to Elle Kennedy's Out of Uniform series. Shelby has been crushing on Garrett for over a year but no matter how hard she tries to flirt with him he just doesn't seem to pick up on her signals. Then when she overhears him discussing her with a friend and talking about how tame she is she decides to prove him wrong by suggesting a m&eacute;nage. What she doesn't realise is that Garrett has been fantasizing about her forever and that while he's happy to help her fulfil her fantasy he has every intention of claiming her afterwards.This is a fairly short novella so you can't expect a huge amount of characterisation but if you're looking for something fast to read staring two incredibly hot Navy SEALS then you can't go wrong. Garrett and Carson sure know how to show a girl a good time and I wouldn't have minded stepping into Shelby's shoes for the night! Although we don't get to know a great deal about the characters there was enough of a back story for me to believe that Shelby and Garrett would make a good couple. Garrett's actions did irritate me for a few minutes towards the end but I forgave him quite quickly and it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the story. I'm also very excited to spend more time with Carson who I believe he's the hero of the second book in the series.,0
"*I waffle between 2 stars and 2.5 on this one*About to get married, Alexi receives a last-minute gift that turns her world upside-down. Caught in the aftermath is Jesse, a ""bad boy from the wrong side of town"" with whom Alexi once had a fling with. In the midst of mystery, the two find romance.WILD IRISH was a bit different than what I was expecting. It contained a mystery that was full of intrigue though it seemed painfully obvious (to me) who the culprit was. The majority of the novel dealt with Alexi's self-discovery and Jesse's need to prove himself to the town. Those three elements would have made a fantastic story but the novel was weighed down by what I believed to be too much cliche sex. It just felt like author Jennifer Saints felt the need to throw in sex to get people interested and it cause some scenes to lose significance.Another problem I had were the few editing issues I found. It's not enough to be annoying, per say, but a few misplaced commas caught my attention, as well as some incorrect tenses of a verb.I wanted to rate this at least a 3 for its execution of an interesting storyline but the erotica portions were just too odd at some points that I felt the need to lower the ranking. There's a problem when I felt the need to skim a bit every time Alexi and Jesse started undressing.",0
"This book begins with an overview of how your body's pH level can alter your general feeling of wellness, as well as inhibit or cause/allow certain illnesses and diseases to take hold. It discusses the causes and contributing factors to wonky pH levels. There are lists of foods that are alkaline and acidic. The text generally advocates eating more vegetables, green powders, and drinking freshly juiced fruits and veggies, which is something I can get behind. Next it covers minerals and other supplements you can take to restore balance, and exercises and other ways to deal with stress (which can affect your pH levels). It would have been nice to see more footnotes or sources throughout the text, as I've learned to be critical unless there are reputable sources and research done on the subject matter. I still think the information is really interesting, if only because it's another way to understand the amazingly complex machine known as the human body.The book is pretty short overall, but it explains its purpose clearly and presents the information about how you can begin to correct your body's pH. The writing is clear and direct, and is essay-like. It's well edited.People looking for alternative solutions for common (non-serious) ailments might enjoy the information presented in this book. I do urge people to seek the advice of licensed medical professionals for anything that seems serious. Still, it might be worth it to try some things that this book talks about, just for general health reasons.",1
This is a relatively short book and I think this means the plot development is a bit rushed given e characters are dealing with such a major issue.  This just makes it a bit unbelievable...regardless it's good fun and I enjoyed it,1
"badly written and NOT erotica! not worth the 99c... if it had been better written, it could have been interesting, but instead it was just plain gross. Ee[...]",0
"I don't see how this book is going to keep me going.  So far I see a selfish woman that cares only about her ideals and how there isn't romance, just quick relationships.  She thought the Hero was nothing better than a caveman dressed in western wear and now that she finds out that he is LOADED, he is so now model material?  Give me a break.  I am going to plow on but I already hate this selfish woman, that only seems to worry about paying her bills since she is petty and all about the materials items, the Hero so far just wants a barbie Stepford wife.",0
"When I read the preview of this book I thought it was going to be really good, so I gave it a chance.It's about Alex are girl who lives with her father learning one day she is a half werewolf, and her father is a full blooded werewolf who kept this secret from her to protect her all her life. Now since she is coming in ""heat"" she needs a mate, and there are tons of single male werewolves out to find her to force her to be their mate.The story line seemed pretty interesting at first, but then it just kind of fizzeled out after the first few chapters. I really liked Alex, she had a wonderful personality and I saw her as a very strong women. But she was the only thing I really enjoyed about this book.Everything else just fell flat for me. I didn't like the way the relationship happened so quickly between Alex, and Joshua. I also didn't like how she all of a sudden knew things about werewolves when they hadn't been explained to her. I was majorly disappointed in this book. I did not enjoy it at all.",0
"The things suggested as science experiments didn't sound safe and not anything to do with children around who might try it on their own later. I wanted easy things to fix to eat from my microwave, not put a light bulb in the microwave. Common sense tells me that it will most likely explode and the metal parts might cause sparks and a fire. Not a good idea if you want your microwave to keep working. BE WARNED ~ NOT FOOD RECIPES BUT CRAZY SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS THAT COULD DAMAGE A MICROWAVE and that is not my idea of fun.",0

"This book was a freebie that I got a while back on my Kindle.It's the story of a serial killer who travels the highway looking for hitchhikers. Once he gets them he enjoys killing and torturing them. After having enjoyed a kill earlier in the day, he sees a girl hitching under an overpass. He decides he's ready for a new kill. When he picks her up, he realizes she is not the defenseless female that he had thought.This short story is not for the squeamish, but is a twisted story of a serial killer. I thought it was a fun read.",1
"I've read Scott Nicholson books before and have liked them, but this was so boring and I did not find it at all entertaining and when I got to the end I went back thinking I had missed something but no, that really was it...Definitely would not recommend.",0
"The pictures are crudely drawn and awkwardly integrated into the story.  As a result, I was more than halfway through the story before I knew what type of animal the main character even was (he's a duck).  The entire story turns on a one-note plot (Willy doesn't know what a &#34;nado&#34; is).  I would never share a book with a child unless it used grammar correctly -- books play such an important role in helping children learn about language, why would you do this in a children's book.  Unfortunately, uneven proofing is also an element in the author's books for adults.",0
"Dana Marie Bell is becoming a regular on my book shelf. I think she writes some great entertaining paranormal stories. the whole series has been a page turner & because they aren't very long in length they are nice little boredom breakers.A touch of humour, friendship, romance & action its a nice little package this whole series.",1
"Sam Taylor was leaving in town in three days, and she fully intended to seduce retired White Sox player Riley Scott before she did.  She owned a bar he frequented called the Diamond, but she never got any farther than flirting with him for the last two years, and she was tired of it.  Sam was losing everything that had meant anything to her, and before she left the Chicago area, she was going to take one good memory with her to her new life in New York, and that was a night with Riley.Riley had wanted the Diamond ever since being forced to retire from baseball, but was having pangs of conscience about how underhanded he had been to get it.  He went to his friend who was also Sam's financial manager, and asked him not to extend her loan.  He was in essence forcing the only friend he had ever had to give up what meant the most to her.  When she saw him that evening, he was shocked when Sam suggested they hit the sheets before she left town.  He had wanted her for years, and there was no way he could say no, but wondered what the fallout would be when she found out he was the reason for her being ruined.This story had a lot of action and steamy lovin.  Riley and Sam are both intense characters with a lot of baggage to work out individually, but between them also.  How can you forgive a betrayal that hurts that deep?",1
I like simon's books  they are comfotable to read and the characters everyday in their behaviour  They are very likeable,1
"Thank my LUCKY CHARMS I finished this book.  I was very skeptical about a book that had ""magic"" in it, however I found myself able to follow the storyline very well.  I could easily see this book as a movie.  As I read the book I found that I could picture every scene as the writer laid it out.  I could even picture each character and their demeanor.  I really enjoyed this book the story line.  The ending was not what I expected and left me with a smile on my face as I finished the last page.  Definetely a good read for any first time mythical, magical, other rhelm readers like myself.",1
"A little too cutesy and not really a very good read. It was more like a series of one liners strung together by a bad stand up comedienne. OK, maybe I did giggle a little. Maybe, if I were 12 I would find this hilarious. My advice - unless you ARE actually traveling with a vampire, just give this one a miss.",0
Wow what a great book. Don't let the other reviews detour you as I did. Although their are slight simularities to part I ( thats why is labeled II) this book held its own. I loved this book and really enjoyed Lethal as well.,1
"What can I say that hasn't already been said. Lauren Dane is one of the best writers. I love her books, they are always worth buying. I can never get enough.",1
"Owen has written an enjoyable, interesting story. As the daughter-in-law, she enjoyed sharing the life of a woman whose heart is large enough to welcome a community based on, yet broader than her family. Created to capture her hero's voice, this memoir moves the reader from pre-plumbing into the present.",1
"I'm going to give it a star for quality of writing, and another star the writers ability to keep a ghost story rolling to the end. Most ghost stories are extremely boring, but this one was not too bad. Creeped me out more then it bored me.I didn't really understand why Twila was dreaming about this ghosts bedplay so much. I know it was to add to the story, but instead, it seemed to take away from it. And it made the ghost seem to be in it for another romp. Sex is not the only thing in life to live for. I did not feel any chemistry between the ghost and her lover, because all we got to see was the sneak around bed sports.In the end, I was a bit confused, but I took it in stride, because really, ghost stories don't have to make sense. They Just have to be creepy.Good job to the writer for not putting me to sleep. :-)",0

I am a great fan of Gena Showalter and this series but this was awful. I am convinced she did not write this book. A big waste of my time ...Now I see why they HAD to make this book free.,0
"Yeah, it was free but completely terrible. If this was a paper book I'd say it might be 10 -20 pages long. Jumped from several months, had no clue what was going on. Never got to see how they loved each other - what made them fall in love. Nothing. Terrible!! Deleting it cause it's not even worth the space on my kindle",0
"Yes there are typos but easily overlooked as the cast of characters, mystery, setting and plot keeps me entertained right till the end. The writing is engaging and I always love a gay man playing amateur sleuth. And yes this retired school teacher also loves to cook. Another plus for me is that Jesse, Tim and most of the characters are of the older generation. A little bit of romance certainly adds to the plot. Jesse is likable as is Tim. The main focus is the mystery, which is well paced and have me guessing till the end. And what a lovely place Maine must be! And I am glad this is a series as I find myself liking this cast of characters and the setting a lot.",1
"There was no real plot. The characters were pathetic. If my husband pulled out some of the lines duncan did, I would laugh. This book was so bad I didn't even waste my time finishing it.",0
"A lot of the reviews on this book were conflicting, making it really unclear if this would be an enjoyable book for me, so let me just speak plainly about it: I thought it was a waste of the time it took me to grind through 24% of this book.  The rapper was extremely difficult to understand speech wise, probably because I didn't have an ebonics dictionary right next to me.  The woman seemed to waffle back and forth about seeing this guy, and there seemed to be little or no history built into these characters in that short time frame of the book. Perhaps further along in the book, there is some insight as to why these two people act the way they do, but not being able to understand the speech patterns or methodology of these people made it too difficult for me to be able to care enough to get to that point.  Thank goodness I picked it up for free, as I would have hated to waste money on this book.",0
"This is an update of my original review...The content of the Kindle version of WSJ is very similar to what you would find getting the print edition delivered.  There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that's ok because it's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web.  The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome.  Graphs, photos, and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format.  It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access.  WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible.  Not only is the content via the iPhone app incomplete, you have to put up with ads!Considering the new cost of $21.62/month or $.072/day I think the cost for electronic format is way overpriced considering its deficiencies.  I am seriously considering canceling.6/2/2012 Update: I have canceled my subscription.",0
"I couldn't get through these books, honestly.I was all excited after the movie and all, but it's a really stiff kind of read.I should have expected that from an older book, it was just... not that fun to try and get through.",0
"I just kept reading and hoping for it to get better but no... I can't stand the Rathan king selfishness. What the rose did to him also happened to her but all he could think about was &#34;poor me&#34;. Plus everyone is bisexual. Sorry, but reading about homosexuality is just not my thing.",0
"This is a well written short novella. It is very interesting how the whole city and its very particular characteristics are depicted with precise yet spare language.A lady arrives to Cougar Falls, a place that is not in the maps to inherit her aunt property. It turns out she also inherits the responsibility about the fate of the city. There is romance, some fights, a bit of suspense.There are some steamy scenes, f/m and and a lady with three brothers.The whole story is interesting, and the door to a series; it does work standalone. Good for a fast read.",1
"Very well done.  Through the reading, Duke and Mav were the epitome of str8te acting sports jocks who think nothing of a slap on the butt or pinching other guys nipples. As long as your eyes don't go below the waistline, then you're safe in the lockerroom. It was realistic in that sense and even the confrontation in the drug store with the homophobe would have made a str8te boy blush.  A Very good read!",1
I love this authors books and this is no exception.  Super hot sex and a fun quick read.  Totally enjoyed  it,1
"So this book was not at all what I was expecting, and not in a good way. I would hardly say that the sex was hot and that is was predictable. I felt like the sex was forced from the writer and that it was added just so the book would  fit into the genre. Also, I thought that it was rather boring considering the genre this book falls under. The romance was almost nonexistent, at least to me. I'm not sure I would ever recommend this book to anyone, but it was a fast read in a milder book. Not sure if this is ever one that I will reread.",0
This book failed to deliver.  I wanted so bad to stop reading but I hate leaving a book unfinished so i was forced to suffer through the torture of making it to the end.,0
I love the dragonverse and look forward to seeeing a lot more of it. The stories are both touching and fun to read and I really want to know more about the physics of this strange universe.,1
"The plot had potential..it was believable..unfortunately the author missed it.  It was still a fairly good read.  I am happy it was free on my Kindle Fire.  I am not sure who to blame for the many many typos or lost sentences.  There were times I would have to read a paragraph over and over again to figure out what was trying to be said.Having been in a Love/Hate relationship before I found the relationship between Kasey and Chay believable but, I fear other readers would be lost and/or would lose interest.I am willing to read another book from this author before I cast final judgement as to if I would be willing to pay my hard earned money on purchasing another book from her.",0
I downloaded this book on my Kindle from amazon and read it in one day...not that it was fabulous but I did like the stories collected from different people that was added to the book.,0
It was to short and the characters was not developed that much.The author needed to develop the story and characters better. If she would have done that then this book would have been worth keeping.,0
"I love these guys!  Can't say it enough! I bought the books individually, but this bundle is definitely the better way to go.  Did I mention I love my Buckhorn Brothers??? :-)",1
"Or just a Christmas romance to make you crack-up! The opening scene in the book is a mishap that pretty much sets the tone throughout the whole book, and yes many of us can relate. The main thing about any of these romances is that there are a number of lies and misrepresentations throughout. Is there such a thing as a romance that's honest from beginning to end?Okay I loved this story so much that I really don't care, but I think it's sad. Anyhow this book was heartwarming and funny! I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a nice holiday read!",1
"I'll admit, the plot and storyline seems to come straight from a serial romance, I.e. Harlequin, Silhouette, etc. But even though its very predictable I still enjoyed the characters and the story. I think it could have been fleshed out and made longer which might have made it an even better read.Micah and Tucker were super cute together. Their romance was fairly cut and dry, easy to anticipate what was going to happen. That didn't detract from the fun of it, though.It's an easy read, not real complicated, but fun.",0

These three men did their best to offer her comfort, security, and love.  And what did they get in return? Amanda was horrible.  She was unlikeable, selfish, and whiney. Her personality, or lack thereof, ruined KANSAS HEAT for me.  I wanted all three of these men to find someone else -- anyone else but her.  She didn't deserve them in the least.Hopefully Ms. Penn's next book will be better because goodness knows this one made me tear my hair out.Natalie S.",0
That was not even a book you made me download this sample i thought it was a book but it's ok,0
"I have to say I liked the characters and the story up to a point. I loved the fact that in spite of circumstances the woman found joy and the man found the kind of woman he's dreamed of.But the story was WAY too short for the price. Maybe $2.99 might have worked better. The end has some hot sex but just ends. I expected maybe the one who cursed him might return. Might have been a ""how dare you break my curse"" something like that. They would have to fight her to find their HEA. No such luck.",0
"Nice short story.  However, I found myself more focused on trying to figure out who Willy was, rather than the story line.  Is he a boy or an animal? A couple of times I reread the beginning pages trying to find out who he was.  It does not say until 70% into the story. He is in fact a duck.  The pictures started to give me a clue at some point.",0
I didn't know that there were such books written so long ago and I'm enjoying these stories.  I hope other give them a read!,1
"This book has some very good bones, so to speak. It however, is too short to allow the reader to develope a vested interest in the two parties involved. Carson is just so sure of things, and one minute Ruby is not staying and next she is.... And then she is staying and all is well. Did I miss something....",0
"While I was reading this, I wavered between a 3 and 4 star rating and it wasn't until I had completely finished that I felt that this was a solid 4 star read. I think this is probably marketed as dark erotica but, while it is dark with a big ole capital D, it's not very erotic. The sex, when it is described, is perfunctory, without soul and not at all sensual and certainly not erotic.There's a whole heck of a lot of non-con going on in this book so, if non-con in fiction is a hard limit for you, I probably wouldn't pick this one up. Also, my review is likely to be spoilery so if you read on, you have been warned. This is book is quite fantastical so be prepared to suspend your disbelief to enjoy the story.We start with Callie/Mischief in the hands of the police. She's been separated accidentally from her Master and is being questioned by the detectives about who she is, why she is dressed the way she is and who put the vicious red welts on her arse. She is beyond terrified, totally unable to do anything for herself and desperate to be returned to her Master.Every chapter starts this way with Callie with the detectives and then returns to the story of her initial abduction and torture. Callie is abducted from a European airport and sold by gypsies to Judgment - an institution which deals in female sex slaves. The girls are rounded up stripped of their clothes, their freedom, their choice and their dignity. They are subjected to the most appalling beatings and torture and rape in order to bring them to heel.Calllie is a particularly rebellious Slave and things do not go well for her but she catches the eye of the top Master and he decides he wants her for himself. There is a strong hierarchy among the slaves and they can rise to the position of `Personal', a coveted slave by a Master or, if they are too disobedient, sold off to the highest bidder. Callie suffers horrific beatings with her body being forced into agonising positions to maximise her pain. She constantly rebels but there is a pivotal moment in the story when you realise she has reached the point of no return. She has been completely broken but has risen to the coveted rank of Personal.Back with the detectives, it is apparent that Callie/Mischief has absolutely no capacity to function normally in the real world - she can do nothing for herself and craves only a return to her Master. What lies ahead for her in the real world is being committed, psychiatric incarceration and drug therapy. She would be essentially swapping one form of captivity for another. This is the crux of the book and the moment that the book absolutely earns its 4 star rating because I found myself wanting her to return to the brutal captivity under her Master. Despite the horror and revulsion I'd felt while reading the story of her submission, I really felt that she was better off back with him and it's this mindmelding that makes the story work for me. She may be returning to agonising beatings but at least she understands her place, understands what is expected of her and feels `at home'. She's too far gone to be able to function in the normal world and her only hope for the future is with her cruel Master who in his own way probably does love her.In this respect, this is fairly similar to Comfort Food but the similarity ends there. Comfort Food feels isolated and fairly sensual but this is a mass organisation and it didn't feel at all erotic to me.There is a sequel and I will probably read that eventually as the issues a long term sex slave faces are brushed over very rapidly despite being fairly major events and will probably get more page time in a sequel.",1
"I gave this book three stars based solely on the fact that it was well written, meaning that grammar and spelling were on point and that the story flowed fairly well. But for me, I think basing this book on the Disney story of beauty and the beast was a bit juvenile. As were parts of the story. Things came to a head much too quickly for it to have been believable and the heroine going from, &#34;I hate this guy&#34; to &#34;well, I guess I can give him a chance&#34; was too much for me to take in. Overall, I thought this book was corny beyond belief and makes me wonder if other books the author has written as like this one. Honestly, the hero tells the heroine, &#34;teach me how to heal.&#34; Seriously?! It's a bit much to take.",0
"I don't know which book is best, this one or Melder. I enjoy knowing more about Mason and the bond mate who loved him and why he was part of another's destiny in Melder.",1
"This is a novella that I picked up for my Kindle.  It is set in a sci-fi world, different from any of Ilona's previous books.  It is also more of a romance than either of her other series.Meli has retired from her work as an energy wielding assassin.  Then her Family asks one more thing of her...to assassinate the man that ruined her life.  The story is set in a futuristic world where Mafia-like families maintain order and humans have been biological engineered to be exceptional.This isn't a long book, it's a novella.  Despite this fact Andrews does an excellent job creating a believable world and engaging characters.  She give the characters wonderful history and wonderful chemistry.  The writing, as usual, is incredibly engaging and a joy to read.There is some action in this book, but it is mostly a story of two characters at odds with their worlds.  The romance aspect is much stronger in this story than in other books from Andrews, and the sex scenes much more explicit.  I am not huge on romance and prefer action, but I really enjoyed reading this book.  I fell in love with the characters and was on the edge of my set just hoping for a happy ending.The story ends well too.  This is a very interested world and I hope we get to see more stories set here.Pick this up if you get a chance, it is well worth the $2.00 it costs on Amazon.  Even if you don't have a Kindle you can read it on your computer.  It will be a story you are sure to enjoy.",1
This novella is an introduction to the word of leopards. It wets your appetite for the full length books to come in this series. If you like reading about love action with a some shape shifting you will love this book and want to the next five books that follow and leave you with wanting more.,1
"The Ellora's Cave title warned me it was a Quickie, but darn was that over too quickly.  I read the first book of another Jaci Burton series and was hoping this one would be just as good. I was unfortunately disappointed.  3 stars for the mostly correct spelling and grammar plus sex scenes, but I couldn't give it a 4th star due to the choppiness of the storyline (or lack thereof).",0
"As noted by others, it's really, really short.  Shorter than you think.  Shorter than it should be for the price.",0
this did not hold my interest at all I didn't  even finish the book 1 2 3 4 5 6,0
"I would not have bought this book but by the description it sounds interesting. The book jumps around past to present, it makes no sense until the last three chapters. I had to turn the pages and turn  because I kept waiting for some thing to happen and for it to make sense. I would not recommend this book to anyone",0
"What a great novella and prequel into the new Guild Hunter series.  This is my first time reading anything from Nalini Singh and I really enjoyed this story.  The world that Nalini has built is both innovative and exciting.  Hunters (humans) are employed by the Guild who are essentially angels, to hunt down vampires that go against their contract w/ the angels.  Vampires are ""almost-immortals"" and are sired and indentured by the angels.  Angels are not the angels from the fairy tales of sugar and spice, these angels are cruel and twisted and thrive on the pain of others.  In this novella we follow a hunter named Ashwini who is hired by the powerful angel Nazarach.  Her assignment is to travel down to Atlanta and hunt down a vampire who has been kidnapped by a rival.  To succeed in her mission Ashwini persuades a vampire (Janvier), who has escaped being terminated by her on more than one occasion, to accompany her.  Ashwini and Janvier have great chemistry and seem to make a great team.  There is a lot of sexually charged tension between them.  There is quite a bit of action and suspense packed into this novella.  I look forward to the first book in the series Angel's Blood, due out 3/3/09.I also recommend:Bloodring: A Rogue Mage NovelSuccubus Dreams (Georgina Kincaid, Book 3)The Touch of Twilight (Sign of the Zodiac, Book 3)Hotter Than Hell (Hell on Earth, Book 3)In the BloodThe Iron Hunt",1
"I LOVE BELLE ANDRE!!!!  Let me start by saying that I truly truly enjoy reading Belle Andre books.  Yet this one fell short.  Usually I can sit down with my pot of coffee on a Saturday and Sunday morning soaking up the romance that drips from the pages and by Sunday evening, I'm sorry that I read it so fast and want more. The story just didn't make sense to me.  I had a really hard to time getting into the characters.  It was steamy but usually Belle Andre has me with the love story and the steam is the bonus.  This one not so much.",0
I liked the premise of the book and the characters but I felt like it was cut short. I think it would have been better if a little more effort put into drawing the story out since it seemed condensed. I like how the story starts and there are some great scenes the chemistry between characters is great. Still a fun read.,1
"This book, for me, was highly disappointing. I was expecting so much more. The author tries to be funny, but fails at it. A lot of the book is very cliche and cheesey. Most of the tips were things that you would do with anyone, not just  a vampire. Also, most of the tips are common sense things that you do while traveling. The character is never explained in the book, or given any background. In the introduction, her thoughts and sentences are very sloppy and flighty. Instead of explaining why she was giving tips, she just made me confused. This book was free for Kindle, and I am thankful that I didn't pay anything for it because I personally, would want my money back. Honestly, I don't recommend the book to anyone.",0
"This book was mainly about how much physical pain the heroine could stand. The author spent most of her efforts having her heroine beaten up and/or tortured. I wouldn't have labeled this a romance (as Audible.com did) because there was very little interaction between the hero/heroine. Unfortunately, I was never drawn in by either the hero/heroine as they were cold untrusting people who were always at odds with each other. The other characters in the story were much more interesting. The constant mentioning of the heroine's issues with the color of her skin got very old and the story really began to drag during the second half. Most importantly, The narrator was ALL WRONG  for this book as her voice was way too old and precise for a bunch of ""hip"" street-kids-turned-cop-squad.",0
"Charming, sweet story, marred by a few typos and weird sentences...needs editing...but on the whole delightful and pleasant...h too self-effacing, H too selfishly proud, bot not bad for a first printed effort...",0
I felt that this book could have been better suited to teens and/or young adults.  Not enough depth to even bother finishing it at this time. Maybe at a later date I'll look at it again.,0
"I loved this book! It is a story that reminds us all not to give up on our dreams because, yes, they can come true! With hard work and determination this young girl achieved her dream and found love as well. I enjoyed the fact that we could follow her from age seven to adulthood. The characters were endearing and the fantasy side Nicole creates is believable. This book has romance, adventure and more....I look forward to reading the second book in this series.",1
"By the time I sat down to write the review, I realized I couldn't even remember what the story was about (I read the story only three days ago).  I have refreshed my memory with the item description . . . but really, what else is there to say?",0
Utilizing your imagination to the nth degree. This is so much easier read to my grandkids. it's good to read all the different stories and go beyond the movie.,1
"I thought I was going to find some new information about early Christians.  This book is really a summary of their beliefs, so I didn't find anything new.",0
I enjoyed this book.  It had a few twists which was nice but it was an easy read and since I read before bedtime it was perfect.,1
"I must say that I don't usually read books like this one, but  glad I made an exception.......I loved May, she's such a charming person....James does seem too good to be true but he's certainly a sweetheart.....all in all a great read.",1
It was nice to read how Maggie was lured back to her roots and then shown what she is.  Loved the romantic ways that Brandt watched over her and then she helped him win.  Be fun  to be a golden leopard with a Huge leopard as my mate. These books are so much fun to read.  Wonder how the author learned her technique?,1
"There's nothing more frustrating than feeling like your marriage is in a rut and nothing you do can get you out of it.  For Libby that's what she tried and poor Quinn just wasn't getting it.  Thankfully his brother Ben made him see things differently and once he pulled his head out damn did he do a great job of wooing back his wife.  I loved that this was a couple who was in a long term committed relationship and they just needed a spark to make them take a look at what they had and what they stood to lose if they couldn't communicate better and work through their issues.  It was fun to watch them re-discover the heat and lust they once had and stretch the boundaries of their sexuality.  Hot, hot, hot!*I knew in this book Ben's story was going to be something special.  There was just something about him that made me sit up and take notice! Memorable s Moments:  When Quinn realizes all the pressure his Mom had been putting on Libby to have a child and tells her to butt the hell out of their relationship.  When Libby jacks off Quinn outside the massage studio and then he tells her he wants their sex life to be &#34;fun and raunchy and spontaneous&#34; and that he doesn't always want to be the one to start things in the bedroom.",1

I just bought my kindle fire and this was the first book I purchased.It was a good read.I liked it.,1
Has some very interesting information on how to write a good query letter.  I haven't finished reading it but I am sure everything with help me in my writing process.,1
"No love here. If you are looking for a quick tale of lust with LOTS of sexually explicit language, go for it! If you are like me and don't mind a good sex scene as long as it means something, than this book will be just as disappointing for you. It was a short book, author's writing style, not bad. Premise not so bad, but for me the lust never really evolved for me. Hero started out as a rich selfish bastard, and did not change enough for me. Not enough love or depth of character.",0
"After reading the other two connecting books I really wanted to read this one.  It's not quite as good as the others but is still a great read.  I enjoyed getting to read Anthony's story as we met him in the last book.  His story is most interesting.Anthony is an accomplished thief.  After being caught in the last book by St John, he is the go to man for St John when he needs something recovered for the war office.  In this case plates for making money have been stolen and now he must get them back.  What he finds out though is the woman connected to the thief is a woman he has known from his childhood and has loved ever since even though she hardly noticed him.  While he tries to rescue her from hard circumstances he struggles with telling her who he is and that he loves her.  As the pair get to know each other more and his mission gets more dangerous she struggles with feelings for him and the fear for him being caught.A great read and a good addition to the series.  Definitely worth reading!",1
"I thought this was a quick read. Or perhaps I liked it soo much, I was able to read it fast. It only took me a few hours if that. It was pretty face paced. I hope to see more of Dev and Laine. I enjoyed it. It jumped right into the action and didn't slow down.Dev is new to town. He and his best friend Cole(and his mate Caroline) are going to be relocating for work. Dev stumbles upon a the local pack assualting there Omega. He get angry and goes to recue him. Laine, the local Omega and doesn't have a filter on his mouth. He says what is on his mind. Both to their joy, they realized early on in the book they are destined to be mates. When the local pack Alpha continues to torment Laine, Dev has to decide what he will do to proctect his new lover/mate.",1
Loved the story can't wait for the book in this serious. I  normally don't say much about the grammar or sentence structure or pay .such attention when I read what others say about it but this time they were so on the money the spelling  grammar and sentence structure was awful. Will I read more  by her? Yes,0
"Very interesting read from the perspective of Bible history. A good addition to other books and commentaries in my spiritual reference library. A good quality, easy to read translation.",1
"It is very rarely that I find a book that makes me not want to take care of my customers because I want to stay with the book.  I understood a great deal of the book and even though I am not into ""God"" stories, this one was able to hold up on its own when I skipped past those parts.  As a woman who has escaped an abusive relationship I was able to see the conflicts in Ruth when she was looking for ways to escape without more people getting hurt.  I liked the ways the author showed the conflicts she had with killing or not killing Rewis, with helping or not helping Bobby and the disappointment experienced every time she thought she escaped just to be caught again by Rewis.  The flashbacks were a little heavy but they did put some context into what she had been through and what she was feeling.  Her final self reflection and decision to start over was a good way to end the story, I felt completed and not wanting to know what was going to happen next.",1
"What a pat on the back for homosexuality! The main theme of this book is repeated many times. "" There is nothing wrong with being gay"". Tell that to Jesus but He ain't buying it!",0
"What a bore, but I will not bore you with the lack of a plot, full of sex talk that was not even erotic.  There was no connection to anything in the story, but some divorced woman whose husband fooled around on her and she finds some hot looking horny man and, you get the rest.  And I, for one, have no idea where one reviewer got the idea of a woman named Esmeralda trying to save her sister and giving Orin anything he wanted when, in fact, there is no Orin or Esmeralda in the story.  I like hot steamy sex, but this is ooohhh sooo stupid.  Keep your Freebies.",0
The animal mutilation and racial slurs are superfluous. very disappointing and  quite frankly---  a  deal breaker. Just sayin'  A warning would have been appreciated.,0

"I Love This Book!!! It is sexy, sensual, funny and breathtakingly beautiful that I can't wait to read more about the men who make up The Archangels. I wish I had all the books right now!!!",1
"I haven't read this whole series. I only read Zsadist's story, Lover Awakened, and became enthralled by him. I fell in love with his character. In fact, the entire reason I'm not going back to read the rest of the series is the way the author tells the story--there were so many other points of view in Zsadist's book that I felt it took away from the true romance being told. It appears to be her style and the book's not a romance, so there's nothing wrong with it. It just isn't for me. So, when I found out about this book, I had to have it. I adored this book. I loved getting the deeper look into him and I loved having that final closure for him, watching him truly heal from his wounds. Very sweet book. If you read any of this series, read Zsadist. This is a hero who will be with me for a long time. She told his story with an almost eerie realism that only made me fall in love with him. The wounded hero. Love love love it. Highly reccomend this one.",1
Id read one of his other short stories that was quite interesting and not at all religious -- I didn't expect the Christian angle or I wouldn't have wasted my time on it.,0
I'll be rereading this book a couple of more times; albeit much faster each time.  Great book for anyone looking to understand the process of mind maps and mapping.,1
"What a waste of time, I must've missed the number of pages or it doesn't say. Glad it was free, a good concept for a story but needs novel length.",0

"Holly, a mild-mannered accountant lets her best friend guilt her into filling in as ""Mistress Christmas"" at Sugar Plums, a Christmas-themed strip club....Nick a detective (who used to be a cowboy in Wyoming) is determined to discover how his friend was supposedly robbed by Mistress Christmas after a lap dance.There is a lot of chemistry between them when they meet, and it is also kinda funny to see her trying to pull off being Mistress Christmas, and Nick trying to figure her out. They meet for coffee one night after her shift and she blurts out a Christmas wish...one night of sexual decadence with him.They start what is supposed to be one night with no strings which is very hot, lots of sex but also kinda funny. They both start falling for eachother....and of course there is a ""misunderstanding"" when she sneaks out in the middle of the night but they work it out and all is well",1
and then within minutes you are at the end  a waste of effort as far as i am concerned,0

"The first book in the Blurred Trilogy and part of The Demon Age series is set in the future after a demon apocalypse and is full of suspense, action, vampires, demons and romance.I found myself intrigued with this book right from the beginning.  It starts off with a battle and the action continues throughout.  The author has created a post apocalyptic fantasy world with a unique twist and very engaging characters.The heroes, Marc and Blake, and the heroine, Kate, find themselves fighting on the same side against the demons set on destroying the world.  The emotional drama the characters find themselves in draws the reader into the story as Marc and Blake join Kate's military group to try to close the demon rip, and find themselves attracted to Kate. They each try to get her attention as they deal with their own personal issues with each other. Kate is equally attracted to them both, but doesn't know what to think or do about that, besides she is on a mission and doesn't need the complication.The reader's attention is also captured by the depth the supporting characters add to this drama filled story.  The well written battle scenes come to life in this intriguing tale and you can feel the chemistry building between the three main characters.  The sex in the story is very hot and leaves the reader wanting more.The author leaves us with not only a war cliff hanger, but a romantic cliff hanger as well, but she left us a great spot in the story.  This was a fantastic story and I will be reading more of the books in this series.",1
"I teach my children to pray to the Lord as if they are speaking to their best friend, open, honest, and in modern language. This had too many 'thy's and thou's' for me and my family, but others may find it helpful in their walk with God.",0
"The frustrating thing about the ""Scintillating Samples"" series is that some stories stand perfectly well on their own and others do not.  This is one of the ones that doesn't.Minnie (or Minerva) is the main character.  She has a ton of back story inelegantly crammed into a small space.  She was married to an abusive ""brownshirt"" (apparently it is 1936 in this story, but there is absolutely nothing to tip you off to that) who died.  Her daughter-in-law is a ""Druid"" and is reading her mind at all times.  The ""Druid"" thing makes little sense when you think the story is set in the present-day and zero sense when you realize the story is set in the 1930s.The plot is just pure silly wish fulfillment.  Minnie has low self-esteem and this random guy (her best friend's husband's best friend) just shows up, gives her a bunch of money for a quilt, and falls in love with her.  There is a brief hint of danger which is resolved super-easily.The male main is just too unrealistic, the reader is missing too much background information, and the character interactions are contrived.I do not recommend this story.",0
I thought this book was okay.  There were quite a few grammar mistakes.  I thought it was odd that the people in the beginning of the book were only mentioned a handful of times and that was towards the end of the book.  I did think this was a good read.  I don't know if I would recommend it or not because I have mixed feelings about the book.,0

"Feel good romance about a down on his luck bookseller and a tourist selling the rarest of Dickens books. Prose is lovely - smooth, rich, vibrant without being over the top. Hot scenes with Lanyon are always hot and male and no funny strange words or odd moments that were not supposed to be there. I agree with Segwick when he says James is confident about sex - in general that's what comes off in Lanyon's books I've read so far - the scenes are part of the story, an extension of the character and the plot - not an extra thrown in to qualify for erotic. I did have a bit of a hard time getting into this one. Of course the parallel's to Christmas Carol are here and welcomed.",1
"Left to die by her werewolf mates after they are convinced she betrayed them and killed their father, Heather survives against the odds, though without the men she loves more than life itself, her soul feels dead inside.Now Cael and Riyu have learned the truth, and realize their own terrible betrayal of their beautiful mate.  They will do anything to make it up to Heather and earn her forgiveness, but is it too late?  Has her trust in them been irrevocably broken?Leave it to Maya Banks to have me bawling my eyes out over the Christmas holiday.  With her holiday release, Love Me, Still, Ms. Banks tore my heart to shreds.  Between my past experience with this author's stories and the publisher's synopsis, I really should have expected as much, in hindsight.Never has Maya Banks' ability to instill empathy for her characters in the reader been more evident than in this story.  I felt everything that Heather felt.  I ached when she ached for the loss of her mates.  I sobbed when she cried over the hurt she saw in her mates' eyes when they believed she had betrayed them.  And when they returned to her, I felt the same joy Heather did at her return to the mates and the pack she so cherished.In the midst of all that raw emotion, it never occurred to me what the story didn't have.  It wasn't until later as I reminisced over the story that it struck me - this is the first Maya Banks title I have ever read that has no sex scene.  You read that right - none whatsoever.  And you know what?  As much as I have enjoyed this author's undeniable talent at crafting love scenes that would melt the paint off a car, I didn't even notice it wasn't there while I read the story.  It worked very well without it.  In fact, I would venture so far to say that if adding a sex scene to this story meant cutting any other part of the tale, I would absolutely not want it.  Love Me, Still was that perfect.  If anyone should doubt Maya Banks' writing talent, this story can be held up as a prime example of her ability to stir emotions without needing sex to do so.When I am in the mood for a good tearjerker with a beautiful love story featuring the reuniting of lovers, Love Me, Still will be the book I reach for time and again.**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**",1
"I have read the first book, Prima, And It was miles above this follow-up. This book has many editing errors and I had to stop and re-read to make certain I had not skipped over something to make sure the word her should have been him etc. It was as if someone else had written this story rather than Ms. Faulkner. The ending? What ending? there was a hurry up get it finished epilogue and not a great one at that. Very much a let down I expected better.",0
I have read several books from this author I've found that her books are either love it or hate it.I'm glad to say that I really liked this one.Troy is definitely Alpha but not overdone with it. He has his own issues about marriage and relationships( he's not ready for either)  and that certainly plays a part in the story.Angie is a plus sized chick who took an orgy cruise to nowhere with her friend in hopes to get laid. She's very insecure about her weight and even more so when she notices that she's most likely the only oversize woman on the cruise.Both are suprised by their attraction for each other but for different reasons.All in all I think this story was pretty well written. There was an actual story in between the sex scenes ....which are super hot by the way.My only issue was how much Angie refered to her weight. I know she had issues with her size but she was so obsessed about it I started to get a little irritated with her.,1
Wow what excitement. Always something else to make you think about who when and where. Great storylines. Smashing ending. Great reading.,1
"`Ashes' is a collection of 6 tales of horror packed with thrills and chills accompanied by a fantastic essay exploring horror as it is perceived within the film and publishing industries. Written by Jonathan Maberry, this introduction spoke of the slow distillation of the genre by which slasher and thriller films/stories taint/dilute the brand and served as the perfect entree to the pure horror stories penned by Scott Nicholson. `Ashes' kicks off with `Homecoming' a spooky and heartfelt ghost story where a farmer's son (along with other sprits) returns from the dead for one conversation. The next, `Haunted' - surreal and suspenseful, full of dread and awkward wonder in which the inhabitants of a once burnt out home are haunted by the people who fell victim to the flames. `The Christening' tells the short tale of abandoned mother to be in isolation both in geographically and emotionally who is haunted by an unusual spirit on a farm - so well defined and atmospheric that I could smell the drew on the cool grass amongst the farm backdrop. `She Climbs a Winding Stair' is a ghost story (see the reoccurring theme here?) of a beauty lost at seas who comes ashore seeking souls to accompany her in the murky ocean depths. Set amongst a ghost story isolated on an inhibited island, this was by far the best story in the collection. Rounding out the collection `Must See to Appreciate' is real-estate horror which throws in a moment of horror before an abrupt end, and `Three Dollar Corpse' which, much like `...Winding Stair' is a favourite of the collection set in a civil war prison camp where inmates make a living by burying the dead and scavenging their possessions. All in all a very solid collection sure to entertain and scare the reader just enough to keep things interesting - 3.5 stars.",0
"Having visions of the past since childhood, Annie's parents institutionalise her believing her to be bi-polar or schizophrenic. After their death there is no way out for Annie until her trust funds run dry and there is no-one to pay the doctors bills.  Now alone and on the streets Annie has to find a way to survive. After being attacked she meets Maxwell, a vampire and it's not long before the reason for her visions is revealed.......I have recently read a couple of short story compilations by Alex and enjoyed her writing style so had high hopes for this book but was sadly let down. The writing style was totally different in this full length novel than it was in the short stories and I couldn't get to grips with it. The dialogue was unnatural and it made the characters voice irritate me.The story line was an odd one, initially I was grabbed and I couldn't put it down. Annie who had been in a mental institution for years was suddenly on her own on the streets with very little money.  Then she is attacked and rescued by a helpful stranger. After being unconscious for a few days she wakes up in a strange bed in a strange house.......Now this is where it began to lose me.......... She wakes up in a bed and has no idea how she got there, she decides to look around and finds she is alone in a very well furnished but `looks like it's not lived-in' house. She recalls being attacked so surely she would at that point run for the hills before whoever brought her there (maybe the attacker for all she knows) comes back...........But no!!! she looks around and decides she's going to squat there, clean it up and make it her home!!......It made no sense to me...... why would she do that??? Another point that made me go `ugh' was that the place was filled with antiques and even though she's been locked up for years and is still quite a young girl (I can't remember her age) she could spot a `Queen Anne desk' and a `Louis XIV Chaise'! I'm sorry but being able to tell the difference between crystal vases and glass vases or identify antique furniture is not something she could feasibly be able to do from the life she has endured up to now.After that it was a downward spiral for me, I tried my hardest to convince myself the plot was going to improve, I really wanted it to, but it didn't. At the point Annie transformed into Margaret  Ann I was lost and only continued to read because I will always finish a book I'm asked to review. Had the writing flowed better for me I would have rated this higher but I am sorry to say the whole book was a huge let down.Copy supplied for review.",0
This book was totally different. It wasn't what I was expecting. I really enjoyed it. Two people finding what they needed in each other. Both trying to better themselves from the mistakes they made in life.,1
"What a fun series.  I loved Lord's of the Underworld and wanted to read more by Showalter so I decided to buy this bundle.  I had read one of the books a long time ago and remembered that I didn't like it, so I honestly wasn't expecting to really like the books, but the price was just too good to pass up.  I'm so glad I bought them.  It took me a while to get into the series...the dragon story while good was a bit slow at first...but I am so hooked.A killer dragon falls in love with a human he is supposed to kill, a human hunting for a jewel that gives unmeasurable power finds love while rescuing the 'jewel,' a nymph who is addicted to sex and doesn't ever want to settle down finds his mate in a woman who wants nothing to do with a relationship, (my personal favorite) a vampire who had violently lost his mate hundreds of years ago is given another chance at love with a kick-ass amazonian woman, and finally (my least favorite but it was the shortest so not that bad) another vampire with a haunted past falls for a cold amazonian woman with an even more haunted past.  All but the last story are really good.  I stayed up most of the night reading Layel's story (the vampire) and had a blast doing it. It's definitely a slow start.  But once you get into the world its hard to come out.  This bundle is definitely worth the price!",1
I read a fair chunk of it and liked the concept but there was A LOT of narration. I just kept waiting for dialogue. And waiting. And waiting. And the sex scenes were not that hot which was a shame. Good concept and I'd probably try something else by the author and hope this was an earlier work.,0
"This was a very touching story about a father overcoming his own fears when his daughter comes into the world. Also reconnecting with his wife after pushing her away because of being scared of losing her in childbirth. It along with the other Black Dagger Brotherhood books I could not put down and loved reading. For me it was like I was in their world instead of mine, and that is what I feel a good book should do. Cannot wait for the next book to come out next March.",1
"I have to admit, it wasn't what I expected. I started reading this novel thinking it was an M/M Romance. Well, it wasn't. I'd categorize it as an M/M Mystery with mild romantic elements. I actually put it aside at one point because I was disappointed it lacked the romantic qualities I sought. That's not to say the writing wasn't fun. Just I expected something different. So here's my opinion of the book.Mystery: Here's the thing, I'm a romance novel type of girl. I don't remember the last time I read anything non-romance. Anyway, I picked it up again and finished it. As a Mystery, it was pretty great to my untrained eyes. I had no idea whodunit until around two thirds of the novel. Even then I wasn't completely certain, just a hunch. Nice.Humor: Quite a lot of humor; I laughed throughout the book. The internal dialogue was awesome--definitely my kind of entertainment with quite a few WTH moments.Romance: This is where it faltered, but I get the impression it wasn't truly meant to be a romance. In my humble opinion, it barely pushed the meter. I was halfway through the book before the two heroes decided to give any clear clues about their attraction. Sure, there were occasional hints, but nothing really substantial. It's like looking at an attractive guy walk down the street and thinking hmm..He's kind of cute. Really means nothing in the end.Eroticism: I have to be honest. It really didn't do it for me. I've never read M/M eroticism, but I've seen some racy scenes on TV which I loved. I don't know if it's because it's reading material and not visual stimulation which kept me from getting into the hot and bothered mode or not. I will say it was certainly interesting in a research type of way. I'm going to have to read a bit more M/M to see if it will actually get me excited.Realism: I had a bit of problems here. I don't hang out in the LGBT community. I've known a few lesbians, but no openly gay men. So I wonder if gay men really act like the guys in the novel or were they just stereotyped. I always figured gay folks lived lives like everyone else with everyday personalities. The MC and his buddy Sheppard seemed a bit dramatic at times. They kind of reminded me of characters who would play on Noah's Ark--a show I only managed to get through two episodes. Then again, Dan seemed like an everyday guy I'd meet on the street with human motives. I liked him, and I could relate to him. So I wonder; were the guys in this novel authentic? If not, I'd love to read a book where the gay people truly act the way people in the gay community/world would act. Leave me a note if you have any suggestions.The only true complaint I had with the novel was a couple of moments when I had no idea who was talking--tags just not properly placed. I made educated guesses about the speakers, and I suppose it didn't make too much difference as far as the story unfolded. Still, it would have been nice to know who said what.Thanks for the read LB Gregg!",0

"There have been enough comments regarding the content so I won't even discuss that.Several people have commented that this isn't long enough. Frankly, I think the length is one of the things that makes it as scary as it is. To take these 2 serial killers and put that much information and fear into one chapter for each of them then to bring them together in another chapter that wraps things up nicely, totally works for me. I also like the way the 2 authors worked independently and still made the story cohesive.After reading King and Koontz for the past 40 years and watching horror films longer than that, I really enjoyed this story. However, if you are squeamish don't read this.The way this was written intrigued me. I have read a few anthologies that are by a group of authors connecting their stories to make a whole. This is the second I have read where they alternate writing the same story and it was extremely well done.",1
"The author has a near obsession with random commas and incomplete sentences.  The writing was so fragmented it was too painful to continue.  I can't give a decent review to a book I can't even read.  The editorial review gives no insight as to content or quality, and lacks descriptive language to entice readers.  Reader beware; a writer's ""traditionally published"" background does not guarantee success in independent projects.  The claim that the author accidentally ""downloaded an unedited copy"" is slightly suspect;  If this is the edited copy, I urge the author to get a new, professional editor.  A dirth of incomplete sentences and misplaced punctuation severely disrupt the flow of ideas and prohibit intellectual progress.*updateA gracious response to my critical review warranted an amendment to my opinion of the author.  I will take the time to read the book and post an update with my professional opinion of its potential.  I would suggest a beta exchange group for invaluable editing, grammar, and character and story development coaching. A thick skin and an open mind will get you everywhere.",0

The remaining counselor has a mental breakdown as they discover a dangerous fog trapping the coed camp of teenagers high atop a remote section of the Sierra Madras.

"The internal struggle Mav faces to accept himself is the driving force behind the story. His encounters with Duke are essential not only to that acceptance but to the movement of the story. And while they are both incredibly hot individually, they burn up the pages whenever their together.Evangeline Anderson has written an emotional, heart-wrenching tale about self-discovery and acceptance. Everything the characters are put through in the story leads to a very satisfying ending. - Karin",1
"A short, but interesting work  of fiction- I really liked the clean, direct manner it was told in. I recommend this.",1
"The book is like a chapter, without resolution and just hangs there to cause the reader to purchase the next installment.  This customer is not falling for this.  Wish I could give less than one star.  Glad it was free.  It is now erased from my archives and this author is on my ""black"" list.",0
"This story had a very good beginning. Very steamy ""love"" scenes. The plot could have used more development, not to mention the characters. Overall, it was okay. Not the best I've ever read by a long shot, though not the worst either.",0
"I received this book from the author for an honest review.I give it a 3.5 rating.I love Paranormal and erotica and this book hits both...yeah ME!!  This books is about Loretta who is in desperate need to be loved.  She seems to stumble in to any willing mans bed but all the while thinking about Cray...her gargoyle protector.  CRAY....CRAY....CRAY!!!  He tried to hide his feelings and not admit his love/lust for Loretta.  Lust is what got him in trouble and made into a gargoyle.The book has 3 parts to it...Loretta and Cray having a finally intimate time.  Loretta getting kidnapped and Loretta saving Cray.  i have to say for a short novella the book was action packed and a quick read.  I actually wish the story would have been longer...which is why i gave it a 3.,5 rating.  I think there was alot more we could have read/learned about with the characters.  I did love the story and can't wait to finish the other stories in the series.",1
"Destiny Walker is nothing if not practical and logical. Love at first sight, soul mates and forever after are just fairy tales, not for her at all. When caught in a sudden cloudburst, Destiny finds shelter in the storefront of a psychic reader, who predicts that Destiny will soon meet her soul mate, that perfect match that completes her. As she runs from the shop, she slams right into Superman lookalike Reece Kellan. Feeling an immediate attraction to Reece is something new for Destiny, something she really doesn't understand.I loved this short but hot story. Watching Destiny slowly discard all of her preconceived notions about soul mates and love was a delight, and Reece is the perfect man for this woman. I love that he never gives up on her, and liked the passion in their relationship as it grew and blossomed. Of course, this wouldn't be an Eden Bradley story without hot and steamy action to warm the winter nights, and the many comparisons to Superman bring every woman's desire to fruition. I mean, every woman wants her very own hero, right?",1
"Very good stories. Four stories. Great characters. Great story lines. Cruise gives you light reading, if that's your style. Enjoy.",1
"I thought this book started out fairly well.About half way through there came one plot element/device that pretty much occupied the rest of the story.That's okay, but not great.  It left me with the feeling that not too much happened.The world seemed a bit thin and there were few compelling allusions to anything greater and deeper churning within the as-yet-untold-story behind the story.I waffled a bit between a 3 & a 4 rating, but I did enjoy the read, so I opted for the 4.As other commenters mentioned, there's a lot of hiccups to the writing due to incorrect grammar and occasionally the narrative will shift very temporarily to first person and jolt the reader out of the story.There's also that horrible horrible war between 'effect' and 'affect' that is rampant within this book.  These words are commonly misused within the book, which obviously irritated other reviewers more than it did me, yet I was not completely immune.What bothered me more was the lack of characterization and rationale for the actions of certain characters.  Some characters seemed stupid-angry simply because it was the only way to advance the plot in the direction the author wanted.Obviously I liked the book in certain ways.  I liked the main character.  I liked the process in which he began making a place for himself in his world.  I liked the relationships he had with several of his peers (and I liked several of those peers).  I liked the general description of the world.  I even liked the beginning of the main conflict, and a bit of the middle of the main conflict (though it seemed to drag on at some points).The question is how much promise does this author and this series have?  Will I pay $2.99 for the second book in the series?Right now I'm leaning against it.But if my current stash of $0.99 fiction runs dry, it will be in the realm of possibility.",1
"Did not like this one at all. I tried, really I did but the two main characters were too ... Non-masculine for me to accept. Not effeminate, that I could handle but more like women with male physical parts. This definitely was not written for male readers. Save your buck and go elsewhere.",0
"""Delilah Devlin's ""My Immortal Knight"" series is an erotic stroll on the dark side where vampires and weres war with each other for supremacy and the occasional human mate.  Ms. Devlin's characters are the stereotypical alpha males with chiseled features, large bank accounts, and enormous...stamina that will keep the reader's blood pumping and palms sweating until the wee hours.  Ms. Devlin's storyline evolves from novel to novel with plenty of vampire stalks girl, vampire gets girl, and vampire and werewolf fighting sequences; however, Ms. Devlin mixes it up with original, uncanny, heartbreaking material that leaves the reader crying, kicking, and screaming for more.  I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Devlin's work on the ""My Immortal Knight"" series and can hardly wait for the next installment."" by Amber Barr",1

I think this book is a good start for people like me who would like to start writing (more for my own enjoyment).  I'll update this post as I go along.",1
"Sheridan ""Sheri"" Montgomery is a puma who also has albinoism (her definition - not an albino), she is also a victim of abuse by her boyfriend a wolf shifter who attacked her. She was injured so severely that Max Cannon, a friend turned her into a puma to help her recover from her injuries. Along with her albinoism, she is legally blind. After being found whenever she moved she finally contacts Max to ask for help from him and his pride of pumas.Sheri has just moved to Halle and is working part time for the mates of the Alpha and Beta, but she needs to be introduced to the pride and approved as a pride member. Adam Giordano the pride Marshall is delegated to give her a ride to the pride meeting, as soon as he sees and scents her he realizes that she is his mate, Sheri realizes the same thing but both of them deny their feelings - of course that doesn't last for long.Sheri's attacker has followed her to Halle, Max the puma leader contacts the Alpha wolf from the Poconos pack for help against the rogue wolf and his small pack, Sheri is guarded and Adrain steps up to make sure she is protected by him - her mate. Sheri knows that Adrian will be attacked when the crazy wolf realizes they are together.The plotline for this was tight and very well conceived, the action is still limited by the length of the book but I liked this story very much. Especially the viewpoint from Sheri as an albino.Again a great series -not dark and brooding.",1
"Jack Kilborn AKA J.A. Konrath is one of my favorite authors. When I noticed he had a new book out that happened to be a FREE internet short story I had to have it. I downloaded it immediately.Jack collaborated with Blake Crouch and came up with this disturbing short story. About a man who picks up hitchhikers and murders them as well as a hitchhiker that goes around hitching rides and gruesomely murdering her drivers.It's disturbing and gruesome and amazing. How they created this is beyond me. It's really a good book. Well written and surprising to the end.I must say though, it's not for those with a weak stomach. SO beware.",1
"This story was too boring, and just not told well by the author. It had potential but just fell flat.",0
"I am a huge fan of zombie stories ,this however is one boring book! All it talks about is government,laws, and blah. No details are given about the interesting stuff like the zombies,the survival,etc. What a waste of 4000 pages!",0

"I tend to cut this author a lot of slack.  I know when I order her book that the sex will be raunchy; there will be lots of foul language and an ambitious plot that loosely comes together.  Unfortunately, this story exceeded even my worst expectations.  The plot was weak and I found the characters so weak and unendearing that I couldn't even force myself to try to make sense of their silly background story. Chandra, the so-called heroine, was annoying with a capital 'B' and too contradictory.  I like a story with a strong but not militant Black female character and Chandra was no such character.  It was hard to believe that one, let alone two hotties would ever fall for this hot mess.  The only good thing about this book was this author knows how to deliver a good sex scene.  However, with the characters and storyline so lacking; this book was reduced to being on the level of a low-grade porn.  It was a HUGE disappointment.  I can't say that I will never, ever purchase another of her works but this has certainly made me more hesitant to do so in the future.",0
"As the candies in the title, this romance is sweet like sugar.Peter is a big pastry chef, he is at the top in every competition, but always second. He is again competing at a national level and again he has as an assistant Josh. Josh is a young chef who looks with starry eyes upon Peter: for Josh everything Peter creates is perfect, and when Peter loses, for Josh is almost a personal matter. Obviously Josh is in love with Peter but he has never had the courage to make a move on Peter, both since he doesn't judge himself worthy of the love of wonderguy Peter, and because he really doesn't know if Peter is gay, since the man never express an interest in him, other than for work.But this time Peter seems a bit more interested in Josh as a man than in Josh as a pastry assistant...The story is short, less than 40 pages, but really really sweet. I like above all the fact that Peter is really not a special guy, maybe he is even a bit overweight, and he is really a sweet guy; but for the loving eyes of Josh he is wonderful.",1
I loved it! Would definitely recommend this one cant wait for part 2! Was a fast read for me but great nevertheless,1
"First let me start off by saying, I am not a mystery reader. The most indepth mysteries if have read are Stephanie Plum lol so I cannot base my opinion very well on the mystery genre. So I will just base it upon my experience with smut. :)******************SPOILERS***********************Yes there were holes in the story that didn't add up. He owns a security company but didnt set the cameras up properly? Quitting the military to look after disabled brother? Sending Gramma off to condo living and not knowing that the house that had been in the family for years had a secret passage? Max still thinking the vandals were kids? I could go on and on about how the author thinks the readers are not bright and wouldn't pick up on all the plot holes. So instead of writing what I didn't like, I can write what I did like??I liked how Max and Ryan met. That made me smile. I felt their attraction to each other when Ryan came to her house to inspect for security. I thought the author did a great job making the reader ""feel"" their attraction instead of just writing ""Max likes Ryan"". When they were both so incredibly drawn to each other but needed to maintain a professional reserve was amusing to read.I liked that Ryan and Max didn't just sleep together the first time and it took a bit for them to do so.I really like how well the author orchestrated the smut scenes. (okay epic thesaurus fail on turgid penis)I thought they were hot and well paced. Well paced in the sense that, after the first time, BAM! they were not hopelessly in love. (I really hate when authors do that)I thought it was interesting to add the storyline about her ex Jamie being a lousy lover and how he made Max shower first or no oral or intimate touching etc. If her previous boyfriend was her only experience and that's what he made her do or what they did, then that's all she knows. I loved how the author wrote regarding Ryan getting her out of that frame of mind. It was like it's own little story within the story.I also enjoyed the ending. I felt Max had really grown since the beginning of the book and I liked her change. I was super happy that the book did not end with having a baby or something. God I hate how books end with babies.So yes, major plot holes and unlikely situations but I still liked it. Question is would I buy the next Turner book? My answer is no. As much as I enjoy great smut scenes, I do need a great story to carry me through. (unless it is a total erotica novel where the sex is the story)",0
"Not a bad book, but too long and drawn-out. The character development of some characters was fabulous while others not so much. It was a very odd mix. I did like the story and the writing. The author has definitely got some talent, but I felt it could use a little red pen love from an editor.The character I most enjoyed was Kelly, but I thought she kind of became minimized towards the end, whereas I really expected to her to have a larger part in the ending.If you like Stephen King and have a Kindle, grab this one, it's not all that expensive and is a good read.",0
"Well written, good character development and enjoyable.  The uber-alpha falling for the meek & weak of the pack gives a new twist to pack mentality stories. The only thing I would like to have seen was more development of the weaker character by the end of the story, not only to prepare her for upcoming battles, but to show her growth & development in her relationship as well as her personally.",1
This was odd throughout the whole story.I didn't understand what the plot was supposed to be about.The characters were one dimensional and had no personalities.The story was confusing and nothing made any sense.,0
"I enjoyed this story for the most part. But it feels like there quite a few details missing to make this story feel complete. I feel like the male lead was such an interesting character, but needed to be fleshed out more. The male lead was a virgin and I don't think the female lead ever finds that out. There first time together was an emotional one. And its worth rereading just for that scene.",1
I found it quite enjoyable to read. I especially enjoyed the chemistry between Sasha and Vadim. I hope to see them in some future work. Look forward to reading more move l s by Stormy Glenn.,1

"This book read too much like modern-day roofie meets mental magic on Darinth.  Tessa goes to Kortal for help in finding her missing sister.  Kortal takes one look at Tessa and decides that she's the girl for him.  He then uses Tessa's desire to find her sister to force his mental bond on her until sexual need takes over, and then he uses that to force her to accept the bonding process.  I don't quite put this on par with rape, but it came unappealingly close.  And in the end, Tessa, rather than being angry about it, agrees that she never would have consented to this 'wonderful' bond if he hadn't forced her to accept it.  This was definitely not my thing.",0
Nice story thoroughly spoiled by mis-spelling and poor editing.  It was a an effort to get through every page.  Real shame,0
"Well I spent 80% of my time tilting my head like a dog listening to a strange noise. I mean it is very interesting, but also very confusing at times. It was a little dizzing for me. I guess it almost comes off as a puzzle mystery, maybe? Jump rabbit jump, timelines could have been a little more...I dont know, but a little more.",0
"The concept sounded fascinating: Love spell sends women to another planet to find their soul mates. However, the writing is poor and the constantly changing POVs distracts from the story. It reads like a teenager's bad attempt at fanfiction. Sorry, not recommended.",0
Was a good quick easy to read book but did not hold me attention.Eden was a great character but only needed Billy in this story.,0
Wonderful wonderful book I loved each and every word in it. I wonder if Ricard will find a love in a part two of this book I find I need to read more about this game family. How does nikki like Ireland and does she ever get to see her home land again?.,1
I love Forti and Charles story. You can tell by the story Joanna Waugh is very fond of Jane Austen. Throughout the book you get little snippets of Austen making you feel like she wrote the book. The only reason I'm giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because I did feel like the author was giving me a vocab lesson. I read s book a day and never before did I ever need to use the dictionary function on my Kindle like I did in this book. Now do  not get me wrong I learned a lot of new words I'm just not sure people talk like this.  Not even back then.,1
"One cent per month? Ok. I bit.I'm glad I did. Updated several times a day (whenever they feel like blogging) on a wide variety of subjects.

Now, I tend to leave it on all day so I can enjoy (or skip, as the case may be) any new Amazon blog.Why not five stars?

"I am an author and have had the honor of being featured on one of the Kindle Nations sponsorship programs.

"A novel full of magic and suspense. A strong woman, Miranda, sets out on what becomes a dangerous journey as she uses every resource she has in an attempt to locate her missing husband. She soon learns she cannot trust anyone, with the exception of a most unlikely companion: a stray cat that refuses to leave her side. And so begins an incredible mystery full of friends and foes and an increasingly difficult time determining the difference...The writing itself is solid (and well-edited). Characters are so richly described I felt as if they could walk right off the pages and into my living room for a cup of tea and a chat. The atmosphere crackles with vibrant energy; I could almost smell the salty sea air, feel the chill of a brisk evening night, and smell freshly baked bread wafting through the cobblestone streets. The author has a way with words that grabs a hold of the reader and refuses to let go. She creates a foreign yet familiar world and I was so entranced by her writing and this story that I found my mind wandering back to the curious and charming world of Miranda during the day and I could hardly wait to get home and back to the novel. I finished this novel 2 months ago and finally got around to reviewing it. In all honesty, I remember even the smallest of details after that much time and many more books read since. That is a gauge as to the intensity of this haunting novel and a testament to the author's skill.I would read this book again. And again. Whimsical, charming, suspenseful, mysterious, fun, beautiful, intriguing: I could go on with similar adjectives for hours. A very enjoyable and satisfying read with an unusual and satisfying ending. I highly recommend this novel, although I wouldn't start it before bed on a work-night. You may well find yourself reading into the very early morning hours. Enjoy!",1
"The book really is creepy and what I like about it is that it has a lead character that is Hispanic but at the same time it isn't something that only Latinos can relate to.  It makes you feel like a scared kid again hearing all those ghost stories around the campfire that your big brother might have told you that kept you up all night. I think that if the author continues to write in this genre that we'll have another Stephen King on our hands.  Well done, Genaro. Keep up the great work. I can't wait to read the sequel to this book.  -- Jeff Rivera",1
"after reading the first part of this story, i decided to read this second part thinking it had to get better.  i was wrong.  jaycee has had a horrible life.  she was gang raped by her step-father and his werewolf pack on her 16th birthday. she escaped and was on the run ever since until her alpha mate decided to claim her after waiting two years to do so.  it turns out that dane's brother mark is also her mate.  then pierre was her mate briefly until he was killed and then dane, mark and remi (another alpha) tricked her into mating with remi with what was essentially rape.  and this was before pierre was even buried.  then for the rest of the 1st story they lied to her, didn't trust her judgement and disrespected her in front of the pack.  all the while telling her they loved her and wanted what is best for her. throughout both parts of the story her step-father is trying to get her back and keeps attacking the pack.  the end of the 1st story is : to be continued. (spoiler alert)  so in the 2nd story when she finally thinks they really care for her they trick her into getting pregnant and she leaves. they follow her and because the bad guys also follow and she fights them after she protects herself and her baby, remi and dane are furious with her and end up spending the nite with 2 women from the feline pack that lives there.  when she comes down from the loft they are rubbing themselves all over remi and dane, who just look at her.  they drag her back to their pack and even when they find out remi's baby was never in danger they are still mad at her and give her the cold shoulder. now this is where i really hated this book, after hurting jaycee time and time and time again, in front of the pack home 2 of the pack females come up to dane and remi and rub themselves all over them with jaycee standing right there.  then they say that they heard dane and remi had spent the nite with 2 other women when they were gone. (i couldn't help but wonder how they had heard that unless dane or remi told the pack) and offered their services for that nite. dane and remi turn and look at jaycee who says she would like them to spend the nite with her, but it is their choice.  then she goes to their room and prepares herself for them and puts candles all over the room.  she falls asleep and wakes up hours later with the candles all burned out and no mates. she puts on a robe cuz she has on a very revealing teddy with strategic cut outs that remi had gotten her before all this had happened, and goes down the stairs to the kitchen.  on the kitchen table are two naked women, with dane and remi's face buried in their nether regions.  they look up and see jaycee devasted and realize she had expected them to spend the nite with her and that THEY HAVE GONE TOO FAR.  PLEASE, HOW CAN THEY EVEN DO THAT TO THEIR MATE? then the story goes on about how they feel so bad that they hurt her so much.  but of course after groveling for two seconds she takes them back again.  i have never read a shape-shifter story, wolf or otherwise, that treated a mate in this manner. i love menage shifter stories, but i hated this one. the 2 stories were filled with pain and cruelity. some of the reviews for the 1st part of the story said how hot the sex was-how can it be hot when they treat their mate like she is just a convient body to get their rocks off on when they are not mad at her?  amazon should pull this story and the 1st part also. don't waste your money on it. i certainly won't be buying anymore of her books.",0

"Story starts immediately with sex (which may or may not work for you). The focus is voyeurism & light BDSM, both of which are weak and diluted.  For a story that JUMPS right into sex, it should be sexier, more inline with it's subject matter ~ to simply state, it should be HOTTER OR the story should be better defined.  This straddles both, it tries be an erotic story and a sexy hot romp and fails.",0

"Second son Dylan Blake knows he is hated by his father.  But, he is unprepared to be cut off when he comes home a war hero as well as a Captain after selling his commission.  He spent more than 10 years in the Army and now just wants to retire and manage one of the family estates, or someone else's.  He foolishly takes on a bet to get Lady Natalia to dance two dances in one evening with him.  He feels that with his charm it will be one way that he can finally get some funds.  He doesn't count on being rebuked by the lady and then charmed by her whole being.Lady Natalia Sinclair is the only child of the Duke of Clayton and therefore has a huge dowry.  She knows that is why many of the `ton' are seeking her out for marriage.  She wants to be loved for herself and not her funds.  She has always been intrigued by Captain Blake and the moment she sees him she wants to talk to him.  She initially is standoffish after meeting him, as his eyes looked as dead as every other fortune seeker, but is won over by his charms.Will everything be ruined by one indiscretion?  Will they be able to buck society and be together and find the love they both crave?I thoroughly enjoyed The Wager.  I read book one in the series before book two and I missed some of the suspense that the story intended.  As a stand along book it is wonderful, but don't make my mistake and read book two before book one.  The author does a wonderful job of keeping true to the storyline and characters.  Many series books seem to lose some of their continuity but this one was `spot on'.  For those who love a tale of the `ton' and want to see a second son have a good ending this is the historical book for you!  Pick up The Wager first.Tanyareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"I have very much enjoyed this series of books, thus far.  Though the books are still in need of some proof-reading, they are engaging.  The philosophical sprinkles throughout the series were enjoyable, as well.",1
"Wow, the moment you sit down with this book it pulls you in. I don't know what is more interesting to me, the formula for finding my soul mate or reading about the extraordinary life of the author. The author doesn't proclaim to have found her love without some trial and error, yet through her errors you can see that she has built her life around her love of people and life which makes this read very inspirational. As you read you can feel her passion for life transport from the pages and onto you.The author has done a wonderful job of combining storytelling with a mix of good information on what a person can do to help them find the love of their life. The book includes more love stories as well, as a result from using her formula.Really great read which I highly recommend.",1
"""The Barsoom Series"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs:""The Princess of Mars"" is story I in a V book collection. It is magnificent and captivating, and it's apparent from the first chapter that Edgar Rice Burroughs is a genius. This is a wonderful story filled with his spectacular thoughts and imagination. Original, epic, and enthralling, I was unable to put it down and am chomping at the bit to read the next four books in the collection. A true master of the sci/fi adventure genre on par with Vance and Wells......""The Gods of Mars"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The hectic, chaotic, frenetic, pace continues as John Carter, his son Carthoris, and Tars Tarkas take on the Issus and the ""the blacks"" to rescue Dejah Thoris (Princess of Helium). Massive battles and unrelenting treachery and deceit continues to fuel the fusilade of destruction on the enemy air fleets. Pulp sci/fi adventure at its best makes this one of the most entertaining stories of all time from the pen of a master storyteller......""The Warlord of Mars"" saga and action continues unabated in the third book in the Barsoom Series and it's fantastic! Almost constant conflict confronts John Carter, Prince of Helium, as he fights for the release of his beloved Dejah Thoris. The budding love between their son Carthoris and Thuvia of Ptarth brings joy to both houses. Edge of your seat battles against the Lord of the Thenes, Matai Shang, and his minion Thurid will keep you awake at nights as the Jed's come together and unite under the Jedakk of Jedakaks, the Warlord of Barsoom!......""Thuvia, Maid of Mars""carries on and expands this epic collection of stories. Book IV of the series shifts the focus away from John Carter to his son Carthoris and Thuvia, the love of his life. Enduring many hardships and death defying battles and contraptions Carthoris rescues Thuvia and receives the blessing from Kulan Tith, her designated husband, to marry her in his stead. Although a bit repetitive with events/confrontations similar to the previous books this is never-the-less a thrilling roller coaster ride that will exhilarate and enthrall you throughout...onward to the V and final book in the collection......""The Chessmen of Mars"" is my least favorite book in ""The Barsoom Series."" I loved the pacing and one of the most original and imaginative creature/humanoid/ creations in all of science fiction ""Ghek the Kaldane from Bantoom."" Kaldane's are unquestionably one of the most unusual, unique, creepy, entertaining yet unsettling, beings ever conjured by an inditer in the sci/fi genre...a simply wonderful and amazing creature! Once again the story shifts from Carthoris and Thuvia to the new heroine ""Tara, Princess of Helium"" and her suitor """"Gahan, Jeddak of Gatholian."" I love this series in spite of its predictability and occasional redundancy. A true classic with A movie in the works!",1

"Reviewed by JenReview copy provided by authorFrom the blurb, The Scent of Jade sounded like a sexy romantic adventure.  Unfortunately it fell flat for me.  While the premise was intriguing, as the story went along, all the situations that Julie found herself in... well, each one seemed more ridiculous than the last.  I'm pretty sure that the story was supposed to be funny, but more often than not I was shaking my head and wondering how much worse this could get.  And then I found the climax, well, anticlimactic.But I think what really made this book a bust for me was that I honestly didn't care for any of the characters.  Well, I take that back; the monkey was funny.  But the rest of the cast... I couldn't seem to connect with any of them.  In particular, I didn't enjoy being in Julie's head throughout the story.  She whined a lot, was self-centered and I didn't see any ""real"" growth in her character.  But what it all boils down to is that I didn't like her and for me to enjoy a book, I need like and care about the main characters.It appears that the reviewers on Amazon disagree with me, but I just didn't really enjoy this read.",0
"Well written though I found the concept to be pretty bizarre. I couldn't really get into the story and found that I didn't really connect with any of the characters, though I finished the book due to a combination of morbid curiosity and a desire to figure out just what the h*ll was going on.",0

What a wonderful set of detective stories! As captivating and well written as Arthur Conan Doyle's. The attention to scientific detail was so accurate. I would recommend this compilation to all fans of detective stories - young and older alike!,1
Really enjoyed these books.  Love to read all of Susan Mallery's books.  Liked having all three books together so that you don't have to wait for the next one to go out.  These books had all of the necessary plots to keep you wanting to read the next chapter. Hope I can find a one that continues with a story about the sister.,1
"I'm always a sucker for a good book where the girl unnoticed in high school wins the hot guy in the end. This is one of those. It kicks off a series that I enjoyed reading. While I'm not a fan of m/m and skipped the book in the series with that one in it, the rest were entertaining and I actually laughed out loud at some of them.",0
"I thought this book would be totally different.  With that said I will tell you that I am a romance nut.  I felt this book was way too sad and ended to abruptly.  If it would have continued with her meeting a man who swept her off her feet and brought her back to life...so to speak... then I would have LOVED the book.  However, it just ended with her thinking that she could start over again.  UGH... to sad and too short for me.  :(",0
"I was a little hesitant at first to read a book with M/M action.  I am pleased to say that it exceeded my expectations immensely.  Not only was it tasteful, but it was not the main theme of the book.  There is a lot of intense battle action between humans, vamps, and mages against the demons that are trying to infiltrate their world.  I look forward to the next book!",1

"A very good collection of folk tales from Britain.  The author tried hard to make sure that the stories were commonly from Britain though they may have spread elsewhere or a variation came from elsewhere.  Some very English folk tales?  Henny Penny, Jack and the Beanstalk,  there are many Jack tales, and The Three Bears.  Most have humourous endings and seem to be stories to amuse everyone.  Jacobs,  the author said he used fairy tales in the title because no kid ever asks for a folk tale.",1
"Wow, how much can you really say about a three chapter story.  I thought both characters were great, and a full fledge book could have been written about either one.  The concept of facing two serial killers, both who prey on unsuspecting hitchhikers, against each other is brilliant.  I would have loved to read more about each of their prior victims, what made them become serial killers, what are the authorities doing about them.  You just know that this story line would support the grizzled old veteran homicide detective trying to catch them.  I really enjoyed the concept of the story, but wish it would have been more.  Horror fans will enjoy Serial, and I recommend it to anyone that likes good characters, interesting plot...oh yea, and blood and guts!",1

"Time travel and pirates -  I thought I would like this book because they are two of my favourite themes in the romance genre, but alas I was wrong.I thought this was meant to be a romance book but all it was about was sex.

I don't know what I expected from this book...I know what I GOT...a poor story.Thank God it was free.,0
"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 6/10PROS:- There's a lot at the beginning of the story that I found intriguing: the avoidance early on of any direct references to ""werewolves"" or ""mates,"" Nate's reactions toward various people touching him, and his muteness (see cons also). The little hints here and there pertaining to Nate's background and what he's running from are revealed slowly in a way that really piqued my curiosity.- Joe, typical werewolf that he is, is incredibly protective and possessive of Nate, and these are traits I respond to every time I read about them, especially if the recipient of the protectiveness has never been cherished before. I really liked the scene in which Joe takes the time and effort to educate Nate extensively on what werewolf mating entails. Nate has a decent idea of what he's getting himself into before Joe claims him, even if Joe does conveniently forget a few things.- There's a good deal of sex in the story (it's light on plot, but it makes up for that with sex scenes), and for once there's a story element that allowed me to believe that one character could really climax twice within the span of 5 minutes EVERY time.CONS:- The language throughout is simplistic. (There's one page that contains the word ""quickly"" in 5 different sentences: quickly pulled, quickly lifted, quickly had them undone, quickly humped, quickly licked his finger...and there are 2 ""slowly""s in there, too.) In addition, the writing contains mistakes that make it seem pretty amateurish at times: isolated POV switches within scenes; needless repetition; a lot of focus on mundane descriptions; too many ""he""s without identifying which character they refer to (""He caught up with him just as he reached his motorbike""); etc.- A lot of the transitions in the book seemed rushed and/or poorly developed to me. The revelation of the men's desire for each other, for example, occurs suddenly with almost no buildup in preceding scenes. And Nate's transition from silent to chatty is the same way. He's entirely mute for the first several chapters, and then when he does first speak, it's not like he starts with one- and two-word answers and then gradually works his way up. He just launches into full-blown conversation mode.- Nate is basically just a stereotypical romance heroine with male anatomy. He's timid and tiny (as in, Joe and Nate are eye-to-eye when Joe is kneeling) and is expected to stay home and cook and clean like the proverbial Little Woman. The author does include a few little indications that such treatment bothers Nate (""it still rankled a bit""), but the two men's roles within the relationship seemed extreme to me.Overall comments: I didn't find this story quite as melodramatic as other Stormy Glenn stories I've read (although this one does contain its fair share of epic misunderstandings--at one point, Joe does something that hurts Nate's feelings and Nate thinks of 10 possible reasons for Joe's reaction but never even considers the most obvious one). My main complaint with the book is that the writing is far from the best I've read: it's plagued by sloppy phrasing and poor (if any) editing throughout. Writing issues aside, though, this is still a fun, frothy little story.",0
"After reading the Newsflesh trilogy and the other novellas I was disappointed in this novella.I expected it to be more in line with her earlier works,but it just seemed to be thrown together in a hurry to give an origin to the zombie apocalypse in the series.",0
"I bought this Cliff Black book and another one (Persons Missing or Dead) at the same time because they had such high star ratings, and read this one first.  I did not like the writing style of this story.  It is a very good mystery story line, but for me, it was very dry and boring to read, like eating a bowl of Grapenuts without any milk - not a pleasant experience.  Though the book is action packed, it just seemed very two-dimensional.As I said, I bought two Cliff Black books at the same time, and after I read this book, I wished I hadn't.  HOWEVER, I disliked how this book was written so much, that I immediately read the next Cliff Black book so I could get them both off my kindle, and I LOVED the next one I read (Person's Missing or Dead), and have immediately gone and bought the next Four Corners Mystery.  It's like a completely different author wrote the Four Corner Mysteries, or perhaps a more experienced author.  The Four Corners Mystery is set closer to modern times, they at least have cell phones, (but unfortunately it's dated due to use of zip drives) and the Perfect Crimes story is set back in the 80's if I recall rightly.  I think it would be a great story if Cliff re-wrote it using his current writing skills.Obviously I am odd-man-out on my opinion on this book, as I think it's up to 4.5 stars, but still, this is my take on it.",0
"I found this vaguely depressing. If you don't mind uncomfortable settings (war) and circumstances (widowhood, capture & pursuit by the enemy) and relationships that seem destined to go nowhere (regrettable class barriers), then you might enjoy this. It started off nicely, but got steadily gloomier. At about 70%, I gave it up altogether - while it might have had a satisfying ending, by that point I was too discouraged to care.Other reviewers have commented on the similarities to Carla Kelly, but I was disappointed to find the wartime setting was the only thing the novels shared. I absolutely loved Carla Kelly's Marrying the Captain, Royal Marine and Surgeon series. They were gritty portrayals of war as secondary to the romance - yet the romances were heart-warming, uplifting and somehow full of hope. I don't mind angst and tension, but I must feel hopeful. I read for pleasure and this book just struck me as too gloomy. The hero and heroine seemed too willing to accept that they had no future together. Their relationship always focused on imminent separation, so they didn't fully enjoy the present.Just wasn't the book for me, I'm sorry to say. I'm sorry because I would have loved to have found another author who can offer such heartwarming stories as Kelly. The many excellent reviews of this book led me to expect a very different read, and I do hope if you buy this book you will have the experience others have had, and not what I found.",0
"There were some really neat things going on with this story with the way the heroine got flipped to another world and got hooked up with the warrior. The vampire twist was cool, but the story raced to the finish. I enjoyed it but think had it slowed down and taken us on a bit more of a journey into this new world it would have ranked among awesome.",1

I couldn't put this book down.. he was SO mean to lizzie when he thought that he had to be.. but in the end sometimes you hurt the people/person that you love the most..i can't wait to see if there will be other books by this author.. if they are anything like ""the heart will lead you home"" i would buy it in a second.. you won't regret this book purchase..",1

"I was familiar with the Lovecraft from the Call of Cthulhu RPG, but had never actually read any of the stories.Purchase of my Kindle led me to pick this up.  What a great deal for $2!The writing is amazing.  The ideas that Lovecraft either came up with or built upon are wonderful.  His Mythos is complicated and engaging.Lovecraft does a good job of referencing some earlier stories.  It's nice to hear about the Innsmouth Curse, for example, in multiple stories.  Though, you might get sick of hearing of the Mad Arab who wrote the Necronomican.  Seriously, was Mad part of his name?This collection, in my opinion, is front-loaded with the best stuff.  My favorites being The Call of Cthulhu, The Dunwich Horror and The Shadow over Innsmouth.  Though, the Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath is really good also.Now, be warned, this was written in a time when different language was acceptable.  Some of what he says is quite offensive, but, I hope readers can get past that to the true quality that is there.Easy 5 stars.Edit - I see that a rival publisher doesn't like this review, as all of the reviews here were down-voted after I pointed out this was the better version.  Tough.  This is the Lovecraft version to get.",1
"The Jynx is the 4th novel I've read in my Kenneth C. Crowe marathon.  Once again I enjoyed the story.  A small bit of the supernatural does not deter me from awarding a well deserved 5 stars. A common man with somewhat uncommon intelligence seems to get into situations that can elevate him into  a life of celebrity  Crowe's protagonist is, once again, as in his other books, endowed with qualities that make him likable to this reader.  These are not serials.  Each stands on its own and the characters are fresh and exclusive.  I cannot identify a moral to this story, just as I can't say that there are no similarities with his other storylines; the ones I've read featuring a clean living protagonist whose politics lean a bit to the left and who are not adverse to a roll in the hay with a lusty female.  There's manipulation, greed, lies, and deceit. Jynx comes closest to &#34;he lived happily ever after&#34; ! ! !",1

"Not sure what I expected with this book but WOW.  It was past erotic.  It is set in 3228 A.D.  the setting reminded me of 1700's Scotland.  The royal families are marrying off the daughter to the adjoining clan for land, etc.  She is against it and fights all the way to the alter.  The Hero is very indifferent to her and treats her that way.Their is a ritual all brides go thru before the wedding night takes place. Oh, I should mention that sex is as open and accepted as our watching TV is.  Everybody is doing it every where with anyone and every one and no one really cares or shows any jealously.  The bride is shown by her nanny and 3 young studs what she can expect and what is expected of her.

Justin Garrett is her traveling companion and associate at the law firm.  If they didn't work together, she'd definitely do him. On the plane she boldly masturbates in the seat next to him while he's supposedly napping, but he hears everything and it makes him hard. Before they left for this trip, he accidentally found a racy email to her friend on her laptop, and he knows she wants him and he knows her deepest, darkest desires. He plans to do something about it in Hawaii.They meet with their client, Mitch Magruder, who Justin apprenticed with before going to his current job. Mitch and Justin share a friendly camaraderie, and Justin knows he can count on Mitch to help fulfill Amy's fantasy. Between the two of them, they work to get Amy to relax and unwind. But can Justin get her to relax enough to give him her heart?In Unwrapped, Jaci Burton paints a vivid picture of the two men coaxing Amy into letting herself go, and letting them both seduce her.

I love the Lord's of the Underworld series and this was a neat short story opening to the series.  I've re-read it three times and I like it better each time.,1
"I can read a book in a day without batting an eyelash and yet it has taken me over a month to suffer through 3 of the books in this bundle.  They are just unbelievably bad. I'm shocked because I loved the Lords of the Underworld and I ran through those books like water, but these....ugh, so bad. None of the girls are likeable, none of the conflict is interesting. And like another person pointed out, all these virgin women want there men to take them roughly. If one more virgin shouts ""Harder"", I'm going to hurl. I expected better because it's Gena and I assumed one can't just turn off their ability to write. Wrong!!",0
"First of all I 'clicked' for this b/c it was free. I must say that I have read hundreds and I mean hundreds of books but have never read such a bunch of crock in my life. I'm trying to be polite here and not use the words I really want to use. At first, I thought this must have been written by a man. A woman couldn't have written this but I was wrong and I apologize to the male population.Savannah should have been screaming rape from the get go and the minute she was freed cut off the magic pencils of the oh so generous, considerate, thoughtful, and oh yes well dressed businessmen involved. Who because they gave her SUCH pleasure were only really doing their part because Matt loved her. Let us ignore their physical reactions to the whole incident. Such magnanimous perverts. I actually laughed a few times when I wasn't spitting nails at the philosophical logic behind it all. Honestly, some people will believe anything if someone double talks to them enough.When Savannah asks Matt to please don't hurt her, a little late I thought, but at his reply ""Never, sweet Savannah. I'll destroy anyone who causes you a moment of pain."" I cracked up. I don't think it was the author's intention but it was absurd that he professes his love and devotion after he attacks her and exposes her to the abuse by other men. Savannah is pathetic since once her lovely experience is over she begins to remember Matt's many kindnesses and was impressed that he just 'knew' she is a masochist since he is a sadist. Excuse me, but I think I need to go puke now.",0
"I liked the premise of this book.  Special forces guys betrayed and abandoned by the government & back for serious revenge.  That is where what I like came to a halt.  The editing mistakes were a distraction.  The story bounces around between many characters in places all over the country.  It leaves a fractured feeling of the story line and poor character development.  It feels like the author was going for a ""Bourne"" type thriller but in my opinion that failed miserably.  I would not recommend this book.",0
"I enjoyed reading this story.  The characters were good and it was just a good read.  It was predictable, but then that was what I expected.",1
"There isn't one aspect of the book that I don't like. Fast paced action, the one that good action movies are made of; characters that are captivating and of course love that conquers all. Written well, paced well and, simply put, page turner. Thumbs up in my book.",1
"I liked this story. I liked Nash and thought Stacy was aiiight - Thought the way that Tressie Lockwood told the story was good. I think maybe I would have liked it more if it was a little longer - didn't care much for the way the story went on ""fast forward"".

"I like a lot of Evangeline Anderson's books, but this one left me feeling a little cold. I liked the premise of the story where Kristen is addicted to vampire venom and that her mechanic is a vampire and can help her with her addiction. But then they go to a D/s club and it just got too uncomfortable, parts where she was saying no, but was ""forced"" because is was the master. Personally I don't enjoy reading that so it was a real turn-off for me, hence the lower rating. You may enjoy this more if you like this type of book (and no, I never finished FSOG).",0

"I found this short short story a little off-putting.  The beginning was kind of comic, like a children's book, with the repetion of 'dark dark' over and over again.  That made the ending a rather abrupt shock that I didn't like.  Other than this, there was no plot and no character development - so the whole point was to draw me in to give that shock, and I didn't enjoy it.",0

"It's a freebie, so I can't be too picky about it. Having read a couple of romance stories that have been free as well, I've got to say that it lacks spark. I really did not get into the story, or imagined the ""steamy"" parts of it. It has a rough start, as you really don't know what has happened or what is happening. However, I must say that Pete has some good lines in the story, such as ""I just don't plan on failure. Success is largely a matter of not giving up. And I'm sure of what I want,"" and my favorite ""nobody can be sure of the future, but I'm sure of us"". So, to sum up, not so good, but not so bad either--for a freebie.",0
"Overall I enjoyed the book.  There is a lot going on and the scenes jumped between couples and people, so often that at times it got a bit dizzy.  However I did enjoy each story.  I didn't have trouble following who was who however can see how it can get confusing.  I do wish more would have been spent in the development of the relationship between Jill and Jacob.",1
"A very good read, I couldn't put it down. Great characters and story, set in Vermont, and ends good. Loved the sassy humor of Maud and the story about her house.",1
"This collection of 26 Western Novels by Zane Grey took quite a while to read, however, I thoroughly enjoyedeach one, it was also the best bargain I have found.Many of the books were written around 1910 yet I would not been surprised if I was informed they were  writtenlast year.I would give this group of books my strongest recommendation.Billy",1
I started to read this and was exctied because its hard to find a series that keeps going. I was so disappointed.  The story was so confusing.  So much going on that most of the time I was lost.,0

I love Ilona Andrews and Silent Blade was very enjoyable.  The characters could have been developed further and the story was too short but enjoyable.,1
"Trench warfare, World War I, mage's, dragons, zombies, and cruel death; they blend together in an odd short story; that is, oddly, engaging.Certainly, not what I expected, the story opens with incredibly well built imagery of trench warfare. Tension is well built. The impending doom of a battle is clear in the language. The author does a comendable job of creating the rules for the ensuing battle.There is an inflection point where the mages are introduced, the story goes south for a number of paragraphs. The word mage is repeated a lot. The repitition is abrupt compared to the introductory paragraphs where the author chose words very carefully with little repetition. More fantasy words are used and then it becomes clearer, this is real battle combined with a fantasy land battle. Although I hesitate to say fantasy, because this could also be viewed as how Marten copes with the horror around him; although not real, he sees the mages, zombies, and dragons as if they are real.Fortunately the story recovers very nicely and flows into a comprehensible and vivid description of the battle. Once the author settles into the type of phrasing from the early paragraphs, the story regains its power.This is an interesting blending of styles, historical and fantasy. Aside from the transition point, a very well written, visual account that is an engaging read.",1
"I really, really liked this book. I Like both Satori and Edwin and think they go together so well.Satori is a magician and he alone holds the power to help Edwin discover who he is and what he wants most in life.Edwin is a young man that has been plagued his whole life with sickness and sadness, now he finds himself, his mother and sister on a train, headed to meet his sisters husband to be. But the whole plain might be derailed by the appearance of a mysterious and handsome magician that has secrets of his own.",1
"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. The pacing was excellent and kept me turning the pages long after I should have been in bed. I love haunted house stories and this one didn't disappoint. The characters were well developed and the main characters were flawed but likeable. This was the first book I've read by Ms. Diamond, but it won't be the last.",1
"I agree it was a great story. Ms. Anderson never fails to impress me with her writing, but.......why was it so short? I was giving this author the benefit of a doubt on the length when others said it was short I thought it can't be that bad. I was severly disappointed in the length especially for the price. Please be warned. I will believe a reviewer next time. My bad.",0
"I really enjoyed the story between Ian and Nicky and though this was only about 100 pages long, there was much information about their history. I liked that they had known eachother in school and experimented when they were there so that their coming together again 5 years later seemed like it was only natural that theyd want to rekindle their relationship. (POSSIBLE SPOILER) The twist in the story, was no surprise to me for the more I read into it, the more obvious it was but i really enjoyed the story nonetheless. Would have loved if there had been an epilogue though.",1
"Great value for the money.  I am a fan of the author and when i got a kindle it was one of my first purchases.  I had read a few of the books in the collection years ago, but this way i got to re-read and it didnt cost a fortune.",1

"Belle Taylor has spent the last year working eighty hour weeks without a single day off.  It is now Christmas time and by God, she is going to visit her family for a week.  She wants that corner office in the law firm in which she works but also wants to spend time with her family.  When Rafe, her brother's best friend and the object of her late night fantasies since high school, kisses her under the mistletoe hanging in his hallway, Belle realizes that what she used to think was important, just might not be any longer.Rafe Bettencourt has been in love with Belle since she graduated from law school.  Finding himself in love with his best friend's baby sister is tough enough but Rafe has to compete with the lists and goals that Belle obsessively makes for herself.  He needs to convince her that life with him would be way better than any list she could ever make.To Do List was a new and fully anticipated experience for me. Lauren Dane is one of my favorite authors and I think this was the first totally contemporary romance that I have read written by her.  To Do List made me giggle simply because I COULD HAVE BEEN Belle.  Famous in my family for my lists, I so empathized with her need to be organized and loved how her quirkiness endeared her to Rafe. I simply loved Rafe because he loved Belle.  His patience with her, even when he was dying for her to come to grips with their relationship, was appealing to me and I just simply desired him for my very own.Readers used to reading Lauren Dane's outstanding fantasy and shape shifter novels need to give To Do List a try.  I wholeheartedly adored it.Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"Rating:  3 StarsThis was my first Joey W. Hill book.  The story of Matt and Savannah.  I truly did not like Savannah.  The encounter between Savannah, Matt and his 'horsemen' takes place in Matt's building where the five guys work to get Savannah to see that Matt is her Knight so to speak.  I think I felt something for her in the beginning and then it faded as the night went on.  Some of it was a totally stretch to believe, but I tried to roll with it.  The story also ended a bit too quick with the final HEA.  Perhaps we will see more of Matt and Savannah in the next installments.  However, it did a great job getting me interested in the other knights, so I will continue reading this series.",0
"I met Dan and Elle in Dirty, Megan Hart's first Harlequin Spice release. I loved that book.I won't rehash the storyline because the blurb does that amazingly well. What I will tell you is that I absolutely LOVED this book. It's rare to find an author who can write as poignantly as Megan Hart, what's even rarer is finding an author who can write short stories that are just as deep, touching, and moving. This story was more than I imagined it to be. I thought, ""A short story about Elle and Dan! Yay!"" I read the blurb and expected Elle to be at war with her feelings regarding a baby (which she was). What I didn't expect was so much to be packed into so few words. It was about Elle but we also got to see so many other people in her life and what they mean to her and how they help her form her decision as to whether or not she's ready to have a baby. In the end, the decision she makes comes from her heart. I love how well Dan fits her. He just lets her make her own decisions. He may plant the seed of thought there, but he doesn't push. THAT is what makes them perfect together.I love follow-up stories like this. Thank goodness for Spice Briefs because otherwise we may not have had another chance to visit with Dan and Elle. I can't help but wonder if Ms. Hart will, at some time in the future, let us drop in on Elle and Dan and see what's new in their lives once again. I know they've got their happily-ever-after and that alone can sustain me, but I like Elle and her complexity. She's real. Megan Hart has quickly become on of my favorite authors.",1
"One of my favorite menage stories and a ""true"" menage at that.The only reason it's 3 instead of 4 stars was for length. It's SHORT... or at least shorter than it could be.",0
"I thought this was just a horrible book.  The writing seemed to be the result of some creative writing class assignment, the dialogue was trite and cliched.  Just as an example, the death of two people who are discovered in a crash train car are proclaimed as ""not accidental"" by the police - what gave it away, the multiple stab wounds or the fact that the bodies were already in rigor and the train car just crashed.  A monopoly on world food supplies by controlling the seeds - anyone ever hear of Burpees.The whole opening scene consists of our ""hero"" chasing after a runaway train car (to do what we have no idea since it's a 70 ton runaway) and causes several traffic accidents that kill innocent people and we're somehow supposed to overlook that because he had a higher purpose in somehow warning the town of the runaway car.  It made absolutely no sense to me and even the crash scene is so exaggerated as to be unbelievable (do you really think a fully loaded boxcar is going to slide that far on it's ride after coming off the rails - come on).The story line was weak, the characters shallow and not particularly likeable and the protagonist can seemingly kill at will without getting caught.  This is the one of the few times I bought a Kindle version of a book without downloading a sample first because of all the positive reviews.  Wish I'd saved the $3.00 as the sample would have taken me far enough into the book to realize this just isn't a good book.My apologies to all those that read and absolutely raved about this book.  There are so many well written, exciting and suspenseful books in the Kindle library that something as trite as this just doesn't deserve to be read.  I'm obviously in the minority here but do follow my suggestion and sample the book before buying.",0
"This was a short, entertaining read. I don't know that I'd classify it as erotic but it is a steamy fantasy story. Dardanus is definitely an anti-hero and not exactly likeable in the beginning. Because of the short length of this story, it's hard to say much without giving away spoilers, but The Knife's Edge is a sensual read about Queen Nestra and Dardanus. While many in the kingdom seem to consider the Queen fragile and not deserving of the throne (Dardanus is one of those people at first), she's a woman looking to give up control in the bedroom, trust someone for once and have someone see her for herself and not her title. Even though the entire story is told from Dardanus' point of view, all that came across clearly which I think says a lot about Ms. Draven's storytelling ability. I was completely engrossed in this story and if this is an example of her writing, I will definitely be looking for more by her.",1
"I really liked this book. It was very well written and the story was immediately engaging. I have to admit that I really hesitated to purchase this book due to the cover. I have become so disgruntled lately with a lot of the junk that is out there. Needless to say, I am very happy that I purchased this book.The story was very good, though I have to admit all the fighting and life/death situations did become tiresome toward the end. The characters were very believable and Wulf was a HOT! HOT! HOT! Alpha male. Very possessive and protective and did I mention HOT? His growling did become ridiculous and I laughed at how often it was mentioned. Waaaay too much - though I like some growling.I really liked reading about a kick butt alpha female who wasn't about to fall into bed with the hero just because of biology and I loved it when she ran away from him forcing him to chase after her.  It was very entertaining and then, damn it, she decides to give in to him with no further effort on his part. I enjoy a story where the hero has to work HARD to secure his woman and sadly, this element seems to be missing in so many romances. There was some of that here but not near enough, in my opinion.Overall though, this was a great book by a talented author and I do recommend it. If you like science fiction romance, with a hot alpha, you will like this book.",1
I love regency romance reads this adds the flare of romance with all the anticipating bits of eroticism. I look forward to reading more of the the archangel series and their sexy exploits,1
"""Oh yeah, come to the party,"" Emma had said. ""Simon will be there and he wants you,"" she said. When did that transform into getting torn to shreds by an evil bitch? Becky isn't about to let Livia get a piece of her without giving something back, but those sure are some strange sounds coming out of that woman. Finding out that your best friend, your best friend's new boyfriend, and the man you have been lusting after are other than human is a bit of a shocker, but Becky is no weak-willed lady Plus, she has to decide the fate of the bitch that had attacked her.When Simon finally gets Becky secured in his home, the Puma in him purrs. If he had any doubts at all about her being his mate, they had been erased at the scent of her blood and the sight of Livia crouched over her in the Friedelinde's garden. It was a good thing Becky had not even jokingly mentioned killing Livia as Livia's punishment for attacking her, because Simon would not have hesitated killing Livia for spilling his mate's blood. In fact, it had only been the fear in Becky's face, fear of him, that had stopped him from doing that anyway. He would have to work on that fear.We got a taste of the Simon/Becky romance in ""The Wallflower"", the story that introduced the Halle Pumas, but now they are back with a vengeance to resume their story in Sweet Dreams. Becky is as sassy as ever and Simon is sweet, strong, and sexy with a healthy dosing of protectiveness and possessiveness from both the man and the Puma. Seriously, what woman wouldn't love the guy? Though I have to say I'm rather glad Becky doesn't just fall all over him because this story is a great deal funnier for it. If I had one problem with this story it was that it was too darn short and that I didn't want it to end, but if that isn't the best recommendation I can give for a story, I just don't know what is.",1
"This story moved really, really fast; to the point it made me cry &#34;stockholm syndrome&#34;.  I generally like this author's stories but, was very disappointed in this one!  If you can get past the fact that the poor heroine is kidnapped, then used as a reward only to be immediately used sexually and then spouts out the phrase &#34;I love you&#34; to the hero in almost the same chapter then you'll enjoy this read; if you're like me and this is a hard pill for you to swallow, then I would err on the side of caution and skip this one.  I didn't find anything I liked about either of the main characters and can only have two positive points about the story and that is that the action scenes and sex scenes were well written.",0
"The action in the story takes place over way too short a time to be believable. The heroine feels justified in committing illegal acts to further her ends, and she's the star of a Christian romance? I found it preposterous that she and the hero would fall in love.  The Christian aspects seemed really forced: she doesn't seem to have much faith, and they're constantly praying for miracles, which BOOM arrive right on schedule. The hero seems to exist to be her human ATM, funding her search for her biological sister, and the pray/miracle seems to make God into some sort of vending machine. Then there were plot holes: how did the villain get a copy of a picture of the heroine that had to have been taken years before she met the villain? Why does the hero so readily believe a stranger who accuses his father of a crime? If the author had had the couple meet in a conventional way (easily done) and have a loving trusting relationship prior to the events of the book, it might have been believable, but the story was like being dropped into the front car of a roller coaster as it's cresting the first hill. You're off and running before you have a chance to say 'Wait a minute, how did THIS happen?'",0
"If you don't like blasphemy, take a pass on this book.  I may have liked the story if I could have gotten further along but why in the heck the author couldn't have used &#34;hold your damn horses&#34; is beyond me.  It was totally uncalled for and, before everyone starts jumping me, I read the low star reviews specifically to see if someone has mentioned the language so I do that for others like me.  I'm not willing to spend my money or time reading that when there are really good books and authors out there that can get their point across without damning God.",0
"NO SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 of a paranormal romance series that focuses on Norse gods in modern America. Not a good read: awesome concept, blundered execution. I'm a fan of Dana Marie Bell's work. Her ""Gray Court"" series is my favorite. This, however, was a TERRIBLE example of her work. Awkward and confusing, this story never really evens out and pulls you in. You're left wondering what on earth is going on and how on earth such childish people could be GODS. Please don't judge this author's work by this book!STYLE: In typical Bell fashion, the atmosphere was light and fun and the story is relatively SHORT. Trouble is this DID NOT WORK for this concept, though. Norse mythology has an imposing cast of characters and implies nobility and power- yet it was thrown at you all at once, liberally sprinkled with trite humor. Not only did you have to figure out which god was which, but then you had to remember what their modern names were- who was related to who- who had what power- what they all had to do with our story! It was a mess. Truly a mess. It was MUCH better suited for a more serious book- a longer story where it could have unfolded better.CHARACTERS: Undeveloped and silly. These were supposed to be Norse gods, but they somehow all came across as the cast of a bad tv series. There was no depth. Their actions felt forced because they weren't given room to develop and they were almost all interchangeable. I couldn't tell them apart except by checking which name was mentioned and then assigning the dark hair to one and the light hair to the other and giving up on the supporting characters. Also, given all of the various relationships it seemed vaguely incestuous...BOTTOM LINE: Not worth the time. Perhaps if you are a fan of this author and find this concept interesting, you might want to go ahead just to see if the series improves. If you haven't read anything from this author before- DON'T start here. She's really very talented! I'm not sure I'll bother with the next book. I just didn't grow to LIKE these people.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. R.G. Alexander's steamy vampire/were/witch romance series:Regina in the Sun (Children of the Goddess)2. R.G. Alexander's threesome themed para-eroticaWicked Sexy: Wicked, Book 1- very simple stories, but I wasn't impressed by book 23. Vivian Arend'sTidal Wave: Forces of Nature, Book 1- with frolicking dolphins and alsoStormchild: Pacific Passion, Book 1- with multiple seaside creature shifters. Both VERY SHORT.4. Anya Bast'sWitch Fire (Elemental Witches, Book 1)- romance with a little more substance5. Dana Marie Bell'sDare to Believe (The Gray Court)- sexy, humorous para-romance with all manner of fae: Sidhe, dragons, leprechauns, vampires and more.6. For fans of manage... Marie Harte'sRachel's Totem- lighter, less developed para-erotica featuring a variety of shifters in a quirky little town. Also,Roane (Circe's Recruits 1)- para-erotica around genetically engineered shifters who bond through sexual connections7. Sherrilyn Kenyon'sFantasy Lover- Dark Hunter series with shifters, vamps and Greek gods. The first book is not as good as the rest- it just gets better and better.8. Sydney Somers' gargoyle spin on romance:Primal Hunger: Pendragon Gargoyles, Book 1and her less-adventurous witch-centric ""Spellbound"" series Say You're Mine",0

"Criss Cross starts off right where Among the Leaving left off. Jacob is homeless due to the events in Among the Living and staying with Vic. The transition is not easy on Vic, but the guys' relationship is new, Jacob seems confident and Vic, typical to his personality - - internally worries and questions everything. JCP hits so many things right with this series and this book is no exception.Setting: Urban and Chicago. JCP gets it so right. She knows the city. The opening scene begins with Vic fishing with his partner - sounds ideal right? Ha - not if you are fishing on the Southside of Chicago. Here is an excerpt from that scene, ""A train clanged by to the north of us and the scream of a siren drifted by from a stretch of elevated highway. Nature."" Ha - nature in Chicago.Characters: JCP gradually introduced 4 key characters in Among the Living. There is no overloading of people and readers do not need to try and keep names straight. JCP slowly leads readers into her stories. She puts flesh on the characters and lets them out to play so we can get to know them. We see their flaws and some of their good qualities. Criss Cross continues with the main four characters (Carolyn, Jacob, Vic, and Lisa) and adds another character - Crash. Crash, what a fun character - a little bit punk, a little bit new age and a lot of attitude. ""A man's hand, wrist covered in black O-ring bracelets and silver on every finger ... Crash was maybe thirty, with spiked-up bleached white hair and a ring through his nose.""While the story is told from Vic's first person point of view, each character seems to exist independent of Vic. Vic's insecurities and worries continue. In that same fishing scene, Vic asks, ""Shouldn't I have, uh ... a lifejacket on?"" His partner answers, ""S'okay, Victor. Water ain't but waist high."" Poor Vic, he makes me want to hold his hand, the guy never gets a break.Drama: JCP builds up to it slowly. We meet new characters, we get re-acquainted with the ones we already knew and then bam - the drama begins. Not all is well with Vic, he is sick and has to undergo numerous tests. But don't worry, despite his problems, Vic is the same old lovable, insecure and worried guy, ""I thought of the not-gay brochure I'd stuffed into my back jeans pocket.""""She slipped a pamphlet into my hands. On the cover was a triangle with a rainbow inside and I nearly spewed the bagel the nurse had given me. Jesus Christ, how'd she know I was gay? It was the b******. They'd found traces of s***n in my mouth. Oh God, I was so fired. And then I'd lose my health coverage, and then my liver would explode.""Poor Vic, not only does he have to deal with seeing dead people everywhere he has to worry about his employer finding out that he is gay, his employer finding out that he is dating another cop and now he has health issues.Sex: JCP can write STEAMY (all caps necessary to express how damned well she writes the steamy scenes). These books are not for readers sensitive to sex scenes and they are not for readers who are bothered by gay relationships.In the end, Vic surprises himself - and the readers. PsyCop is one of my favorite urban fantasy series and I highly recommend it.",1
"I am a long-time reader of Lora Leigh's books, and this one was pretty good.  The plot line was predictable but I liked the interaction between Sax and Marey.  However, there is one aspect of this author's writing that I really get tired of, and that is her over-use of phrases such as ""breathed out roughly"", ""spoke roughly"", ""breathed in roughly"", ""whispered roughly"";  please, Ms. Leigh, be aware that when one word is used over and over again in books, ad nauseum, it gets really old fast!  In this particular book, I counted at least 6 times when these types of phrases were used.",0

Just not my cup of tea. Sorry.",0
"I've enjoyed other Devlin books, but this one read like someone was holding a gun to her head and would shoot if she typed fewer than 50 words per minute. Come to think of it, that would have been a far more entertaining story than this mess.Where to start? There were sentence-level mistakes that indicated a lack of proofreading (your/you're, the ""creek"" of the stairs, etc.) but I can generally forgive those if the characters are engaging. Dylan and Emmy weren't just not engaging, they were actively off-putting. He's broody and dull, she's chunky and grateful, and I think they hook up because no one else wants to be around them. They start having sex five seconds after they meet and every hour after that, including in the wreckage of a car crash. (In the book's most stomach-churning scene, he's not even conscious for it!)Other problems abound. The stupidity of the dialog is matched only by its sheer volume. I kept thinking that only the sweet release of death would make Emmy shut the hell up, but no. Her conversation was just as inane after death as before. (I guess that was a spoiler, but honestly you won't care.) Oh, and there's an English guy who says things like what ho, I say, old chap and other things dumb people think English people say. And some dead dogs. Are you turned on yet?This is the laziest book I've ever read. The fact that it exists is either an indictment of the entire publishing industry or the proud culmination of the digital age, in which every awful idea anyone has is instantly available for worldwide consumption.Gosh, I can't wait for part two!",0
"I love Donna Grant..! I am an avid reader but I cannot give this book 4-5 stars. Maybe it's because I hated the herione in the book, but I could'nt relate to her character. I could not understand her character or the stupid stuff she chose to do. I understand that she was trying to save the lives of her family and her mate but I just don't get it. I also do not understand that when she dies, he goes after her soul but whilst in heaven/or the in-between place both characters remain proud by still refusing to say they love one another. I mean here you are literrally dead and you still fighting what you feel..? Really...! I found this book boring and long winded. I would not recommend this book and I am glad I only paid $1.45 for it.",0
Not a romantic or erotic book! Just an FYI.... Why it's listed like that? No clue. I am not saying it was a terrible book but I could not finish because it was not what I was looking for!,0
"The story itself was good, and I did enjoy it, but I feel cheated that I thought I was downloading a book, and instead got a very short story.  I hate short stories!  There is no chance to dig in and get to know the characters, and there is no room for the plot enrichment that makes a story really satisfying.  I'll look more carefully next time.",1
"Wolf Signs was decent enough. The writing wasn&#8217;t spectacular, though nor was it horrendous by any measure. The storyline was easy to follow, simple and uncomplicated in a straightforward, honest way. It&#8217;s in the characters where I take up issue.TJ was my favorite things about this entire book. In the scene where Robyn first encounters him and his brother Keil, it was from his point of view, so I automatically latched onto him. It helped that he was fun and carefree, and Keil was being an absolute weirdo, sniffing the door Robyn had just slammed on them for like 5 minutes straight. I was kinda expecting more from him than to be shit on for the whole rest of the trip.And can we please address this whole predicament about Robyn stopping a bloody death-brawl showdown with her pheromones?! Someone alert the police, there&#8217;s another speshul snowflake among a pack of like 10 guys and only one of them is not opposed to jumping her like a rack of meat.Good God, there was nothing even remarkable about Robyn. The only thing that interested me about her was that she was deaf, and that was only because on my of main projects right now deals with a character who is mute and communicates through ASL. I wanted to see how well author Arend would handle the obstacle, but it&#8217;s hardly even a problem because Robyn can read lips, write witty things and, oh yeah, communicate telepathically with the one person she&#8217;s around for most of the story. And can speak anyway. With a pleasing, powerful voice, at that. Ugh.I liked the story. Kinda. It was short and sweet and a little engaging in some parts, at least in learning about the wolves and watching the attraction grow between Keil and Robyn, but there&#8217;s so much more negative to say about it (and most of the crap surfaces at the end, whereas the first half or so was actually enjoyable). Unfortunately, I&#8217;m just not interested in the unlikeable nature of these characters (and my favorite ones getting shit on left and right) to continue with the rest of the series.Oh and the instalove; I understand they&#8217;re mates, but holy crap, they spent like FIVE DAYS together&#8230;",0
"Poetry, prose, and short stories comprise this book about the author's struggle through life and relationships.  Childhood pains are delved into, including dealing with her religion.  The author deals with being stuck and not really belonging, having left the church, but still not a part of the world as a whole.I have to admit, the subtitle ""Memoirs of an Exmormon"" is what drew me to download this free book.  Having become fascinated with the LDS church, I really thought this book would have some perspective on LDS doctrine, and why the author defected.  I was sadly disappointed that very little is discussed about the church.  In fact, very little of anything is discussed.I found this book terribly confusing; I felt like there was no real cohesiveness to it, it skipped around a lot, and I am still a little confused as to whether is this an actual memoir, or if it is just a book of stories and poetry with an incredibly misleading title.  It seemed to me like the book tries to hard to be hip, and beatnik, and anyone who does not ""get"" the book is surely uptight and unsophisticated.  But I will freely admit, I just did not get it.I think there is potential here, however.  With a bit more material, and substance, not to mention a good editor, I think something really interesting could me made of this work.",0
"Okay, home boy kind of had it going on, in a not really realistic way. But what can you really expect from a book (HA!) like this?Home girl was in it for the bed sports, and nothing more. She only says that magic words when poked and prodded to. So yeah, I was not feeling it from her end. All she wanted was more &#34;Bow-chicka-bow, bow&#34;, and of course, homey don't mind that. Might be happy to see the rolls reversed for a change.The story was well written in the way of very litter grammatical errors, but it was not enough to support the cheesy dialog.I wonder if the publishing house of Naughty Nooners is aware that the more bad reads the let escape, the less likely people will be to pay for the ones still in captivity.

Yeah, if you ain't got nothing better on your plate, or want some cheese with your wine. :-)",0
This story annoyed me from page one. it got 2 stars instead of 1 because the grammar was decent. the sex scenes were stupid and boring and the plot was idiotic. don't waste your money.,0
Oh My God ...... What a good book I Love this storie . Makes me happy I got this book on my Kindle .And the sex was hot  loved it . Rafe and Bella Wow  I think I`m in lust ......,1
An interesting adventure story leading into a suspension story to hold your attention for the duration! I enjoyed this book VERY much and look forward to more to follow.u,1
If your a BDB fan and especially a fan of Zsadist this novella is a must!  It is a touching story about Zsadist after his daughter is born.  I fell in love with him all over again.,1
"Everyone seems to be writing paranormal books these days and they seem to be either vampires or shifters, this was different!  The guy is a gargoyle.  I wasn't sure how I would like that, but it worked very well.  Good job thinking of a new way to bring us paranormal!",1
"This was a very touching book, dealing with two people who had a lot of scares to overcome and were able too.",1
"This is a short story first published in 1940 as a two part serial in the pulp fiction magazine Argosy. The author later decided to develop the characters in three novellas which have also been adapted to the Kindle. This is a very quick read, and thus since it is so inexpensive I recommend that anyone who is interested in the genre and plans to read the subsequently published books( which I rate highly) should read it first.The main character in this book is the detective Doan, and unfortunately his huge Great Dane Carstairs makes only a cameo introductory appearance.  Fortunately, in the subsequent stories Carstairs plays an integral role and adds immeasurably to the reader's enjoyment. Doan's unimpressive appearance leads his adversaries to underestimate his (and Carstairs') skill and intelligence, and in this introduction to his character the author has not yet fully developed Doan's skills. However, it is still a typical pulp fiction story concerning a hard boiled detective except for the fact that as the author developed the characters over the series he injected much more humor than was usual for that era.After an interesting introduction to the series' characters in the first few chapters, Doan is tasked to protect a young heiress about to receive her inheritance. He travels to a wilderness resort cabin, and becomes isolated there with a strange cast of characters while a blizzard rages outside. However,  murders occur, misdirection abounds, and of course he eventually untangles the web of deceit, earning his keep and rescuing a damsel in distress.. As in all short stories of this type, the prose is spare and the character development minimal. But a fast pace keeps the reader's interest.Unfortunately,  the author Norbert Davis is not as well known as other pulp fiction writers of the period for three reasons. First, his stories encompassed a wide array of genres, so he never built a reputation as a practitioner  of specific type (e.g. detective, SF, etc.) . Second, his detective stories included a strain of humor which was highly unusual for the period, a hard boiled detective story was not supposed to be funny. Third, he committed suicide at age 40, supposedly after he had been diagnosed with cancer. Thus, his potential literary legacy was truncated. However, among his peers he was regarded as in a class with the best writers of the era, including Hammett and McDonald. He graduated from Stanford with a law degree, but never took the bar exam - choosing instead to pursue a career which he had already established by being published while still in college, usually being paid at the going rate of a penny a word. Hopefully, the advent of ebooks and specialized small presses will allow many more potential fans to enjoy his works and be delighted by Carstairs' collaborations with Doan.Also, after reading this short story you can decide if you agree with me that the author's choice of title was very clever due to the multiple images invoked.Tucker Andersen 6/4/2010",0
"Short precise reading of a first hand account by a Doctor of the time. It is a short read, but interesting.",1
"This just wasn't a great read at all. J.L. Langley has been a favorite author of mine since I read Without Reservations and I expected His Convenient Husband to be just as good, but it wasn't. While I might not be completely into the cowboy trope like the other readers I have enjoyed it on occasion (so it's not that), but this one just felt like a cliched, by-the-numbers plot. It lacked any kind of interesting qualities and missed the sexual chemistry between Micah and Tucker by a mile. I like her other books immensely, but this will be quickly forgotten for her other entertaining books.",0
Based on my opinion only...I didn't know this book was about Vampires and all (based on the first page)so I stopped reading it.,0
Didn't finish the book.  Wasn't what I like reading but someone else might like it .  Thanks for the read though,0
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. She is a very good author.  It was super sexy and had a good storyline.  I am going to read more of her books.  Read this, you'll like it.",1
"** Note: this story appears as a bonus in the paperback edition of Survivor's Quest. **Fool's Bargain is a short story featuring the stormtroopers of Aurek-Four, a unit of the Imperial 501st Legion of the Empire of the Hand.  It takes place shortly before the events of Survivor's Quest, but is probably best read after.The Empire of the Hand is involved in a war to rid the native Eickarie people of their latest warlord, but the 501st curious orders are very specific - take the warlord alive.  This story is tightly focused, with a couple of characters firmly at the center.  There's good detail here but for some reason it doesn't feel as well developed as other short stories I've read by Zahn.  Also,  those who look for big names in their Star Wars stories will want to give this a pass.  A couple of minor characters from Survivor's Quest show up in largely supporting roles, but there are no movie characters nor beloved favorites here.But despite these caveats Fool's Bargain is a good short story that gives further glimpse of Zahn's take on stormtroopers, which he touched on in Survivor's Quest, and would continue to explore in later novels (Allegiance and Choices of One).",0
I am not sure what I was expecting with is book but I did not think it was anything I would use. Everything looked cheap and not worth the time...duck tape or effort.....I am sure the duck tape is pricey too.,0
"I actually read the 2nd book in this series several years ago.  This book was a little harder to read at first due to the sentence structure. The story was very good but I took one star off due to some missed words, misspelled words, a couple of words used that when looked up didn't even match any description in The American or UK Dictionary. (Totally out of context)  That being said once I got past that this is a good book, interesting, sexy, erotic book.  I Know that I will save this book and reread it again. I would love to see another book from this series and I would definitely buy it. For 7.99I would appreciate Ms. Dane giving this book to an editor!",1

"You cannot beat Edgar Rice Burroughs for a rousing tale.  Though I would classify it as pre-teen+ as the most likely audience, though it is great for us old codgers too,",1
"This is a really cute little story. I sat down and read it in an afternoon, and felt it time well spent on a rainy/snowy day. The characters were interesting. I liked the main male character, an Oregon professorial candidate specializing in the flora and fauna of Oregon. What was most interesting, though, was the concept of a race from the stars who are intelligent, gentle, and devoted to one another. Very nice. I know some were frustrated by the fact that Kent took to Povre so easily. Hey, get a grip, people! It is a story - a very sweet story of the most unusual kind of 'cross-racial' relationship. Extremely cross-racial, as in cross-species. But how is that any more questionable than the whole ""woman meets vampire/werewolf/demon/angel"" thing that is so popular these days? I love those, too! The idea that a human botanist/biologist could find an endangered alien and not want to cut her up? Pretty cool concept. Of course, as a scientific personality, I see the problems with the whole 'iron based vs. cobalt based' blood and genetic issues with the baby thing - but hey, as I said before, it is a sweet, simple, very positive story. Something I enjoyed a great deal.All in all, I am really glad that I caught a glance at it as a 'suggested read' for me and took a chance on it. I will absolutely look for more by this author.",1
"I liked the story line, wished there was a little more. I am looking forward to the next book, I would recommend this book.",1

I enjoyed the read and I think any fan of a humorous must err use will like this. Give it a try.,1
"I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  I enjoyed how Ms Dubois told the story- in fact I have already purchased and read the 2nd and 3rd book in the series.

"Will has been in love with his best friend since they were 15 years old.  Now 30, he's serving in the Navy as a SEAL.  He's tired of being ""just friends.""  He shows up at Mackenzie's house in the middle of the night and gives her an ultimatum.  ""Be my lover or nothing at all.""  Mackenzie has psychic visions and has the ability to read others' minds.  This has created rifts in her relationships with other men.  She has a vision of a helicopter crashing, with Will in it, so she kicks him to the friend zone to protect her own heart.Another reviewer commented on the childishness of the character's actions.  I agree.  A lot of the reasoning and decision making is not based on mature love.  It's based on a desire for self preservation.I enjoyed the other books in the series more than this one.",0
This is a fascinating book;  enough twists and turns to keep me reading longer than I usually read in one sitting. With a totally new way of looking at zombies and how they function.A book I recommend. I've started reading the second book and have the third and last waiting for me.,1
"The plot is as noted by the publisher's blurb (and this publisher does make some fun ones!)-- a nice, quiet, boring librarian with a little bit of a secret that blossoms into a bigger secret.  Fun with a werewolf, no fun with the bad guy (unless you count the part at the end) and a story that was well suited to the novella format.  That means a quick conclusion and some pat answers, but that is exactly what was called for in this length of story.  I read this in between a couple of  Really Long and Serious Urban Fantasy Novels...just the thing to pick me up and give me a chuckle--the Not-So-Long-and-Definitely-Not-Serious werewolf story.With nookie.This one is definitely worth the purchase price, and is good enough to send me out in search of other titles by this author.  Should she decide to expand this into a series and/or into a full length novel, I will be a buyer!JTG",1
"I was so looking forward to this book. Then it came and there is a double space between each and every paragraph. (on the Kindle edition)  Since the action moves around, the formatting makes the story hard to follow, and only the die hard (like me) will want to bother.It's a sad thing when a good book is so spoiled by formatting. But it is not the fault of the author or the story. This is a good book for any who have the energy to read it.I've also emailed the author.",1
We already owned this book.  My spouse forgot that it was already part of our library of books.  It is unfortunate that Amazon did not have a safeguard in place to notify that this book was already in our library.,0

"This is a very short short story.  It's basically a few scenes at a party and one night (though admittedly some entire books have taken over that period,  this one doesn't)  It's pure erotica - has an hea,  but no real relationship, no depth, just sexual descriptions.  I was really disappointed and I have to get used to this kindle notation - I find the lack of page numbers confusing,  so I don't really know what I'm getting into until I down load it.I've not found a m/m regency romance that really does it for me, and we have no idea why these 2 men love each other,  other than their looks.  This took about 30 mins to read and I wish I could return it,  even for $2.50 I felt ripped off.",0
"All for Secret Service agents have secrests, even those no longer in service.  Meet Argus Ward, a former Secret Service agent who runs a protection agency catering to the rich and famous.  His secret: he is a functioning paranoid schizophrenic.  Accused of killing a famous client, who is also the richest man in America, Argus finds himself with no memory of the murder and in a psychiatric ward.  But how do you prove the world is out to get you when you're a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic?  It's not real, it's only paranoia, right?Eric Christopherson's debut novel is a psychological thriller with twists and turns.  Is he paranoid?  Is it real?  He easily blurs the reality line in Cracked-Up.  Christopherson is masterful with his descriptions of what being a paranoid schizophrenic would be like.  I couldn't tell what was real and what was ""an episode"" at certain points.  I was sure Argus Ward had ""Cracked-Up"" and then I was sure he was sane and so the cycle went until the end.  If you're in the mood for twists and turns, pick this one up.  I plan on reading more by Mr. Christopherson.",1
"How in the world can Diana love Alma?? He is rude to her and then nice for 2 or 3 days then rude again then kisses her and then leaves. He goes to London while still thinking of her and sleeps with his mistress everyday and then when Diana comes to London, they argue and she meets his mistress. Alma still sleeps with his mistress while wanting Diana and only stops when he realizes another man might ask to marry Diana and he decides that he wants to marry her too. OMG... the most self centered, man whore I have ever read. You do not sleep around when you are supposed to have feelings for the heroine. I cannot stand it when authors do that, it makes me sad for the heroine that she has to be written to love a man like that. I would never have had feelings for him and if I did, I would never have married him on the sleeping around thing alone, like he couldn't give up sex for the woman he loves...good gosh!! I only liked the book for George and Alonna but once they got together 1/2 through the book, I was rushing for the end just to get it over with.",0

Even though it's free, I think most people will end up deleting it. I did.",0
Gratuitous violence. Not much imagination. Fortunately a quick read or I wouldn't have had the patience to finish the book.,0
"This was a nice romance between two mature adults. It was short and to the point and predictable. I would have like more background for the two characters, and even the daughter.

"Charlene Harris Starts off hot and heavy in the jungle and does not let up.The heat, humidity and the forth coming change can be felt by the reader. The entrance the dynamic hero, black leopard, sexy man,etc., places a burden on heroine that is almost stiffling. The conclusion we know but the arrival is a thrill.",1
"This book really did it for me. The humor was usually dry, but kept me laughing just the same. I have no doubt that this book is not for everyone. That being said, I will offer some sound advice for you, the prospective reader:Download this book. It's free, after all. If the premise and first few entries don't have you laughing (or at the very least, smiling), stop reading. Also, check your pulse.",1
This was perhaps the most surreal little story with absolutely NO set up that I have ever encountered.  Truly surreal and silly.,0
"I loved this book. A definite keeper. Rafe really loved his wife Cathy. His love is especially evident during a pivotal moment that leaves Rafe with the decision of whether to proceed forward, or to go back and safe his wife. Dee S. Knight did a superb job at describing the tornado scene. I now have a new found fear and respect for tornadoes.",1
"the heroine's mother should won the award for the most annoying heroine's mother. the story was good but it was poorly written. the heroine whined all the time.  the heroine's family was well off. the way they talked did not showed that.  the heroine had a bad mouth for a teacher. she showed some manners sometimes, but most of the time she acted like she came froma gutter.  the hero was reserved but ten years ago he wanted to get rid of the heroine. he said he dated to make her jealous, but he enjoyed those dates. the book deserve one star because the plot was good, but the heroine and the heroine's mother ruined it.",0
"I love historical fantasy, but seeing as how this was a short story, I really couldn't get into it all that well. What I did read was wonderful!",1
"The writing was atrocious in this book. One more ""had"" and the Kindle would have been thrown across the room. In addition to the constant repetition of the word had the sentence structure was often so bad that it made little sense.",0
"The plot idea was interesting, but it was poorly executed. The characters were unrealistic and underdeveloped. I kept reading (though I skimmed a good deal) just to find out how it ended and when that was revealed...it was preposterous. Frankly, it was insulting, like the author couldn't be bothered with writing a better book.",0
"For awhile I thought this was going to be something special, but I was wrong. Even after 500 years these lovers still can't get enough sex or go without seeing each  other and nothing and no one else matters unless they can be together. It's supposed to be 'love conquers all' but here sex masquerading as love conquers all. These two need no one but each other and when together it's always becomes sex. This writer once again has a theme or concept that she fails to develop. It could be erotica except that the writer introduces too much into the story that separates a couple who don't want to be parted. They had been a team in the past but could not be so in the present nor was there any evidence of  what changes occurred in the world to which she could adapt but he could not. With more information about what was going on in the world that required her return other than a promise, the reader could understand her mission and perhaps see one for him as well. We're not given anything to work with that is developed enough to make sense even in a fantasy world. The characters not only remain the same physically for 500 years but they don't grow in intelligence or understanding of each nor the world around them. It's about sex that is only fulfilling at the moment and must constantly be repeated without loss of any passion or perception that they are not alone and may be needed else where. The 'Elders' seem to be nothing more that mythical gods who can't be pleased for long. Forever is no time at all to these people and life has no meaning that the writer shares with the reader. Trite! Hackneyed  and devoid of substance.",0
"Just to explain, I know that some might think a 3.5 star rating would equal a C+, but to me, a 5-star book is one that is truly exceptional.  I think this deserves more than a C+.  See below.This is a sci-fi book about Lucy who suddenly finds herself beamed up into outer space.  From there, she quickly embarks on a relationship with Three, who is actually a human who lost his memories and is trying to return home.  I didn't mind the amount of sex in this book because Elsborg writes erotica very well and this book was nice and hot.  Lucy's thoughts were also hilarious and it was great to see the change and impact she had on the alien culture.  Also, in my opinion, the author did write just the right amount of a plot with sufficient details.  I categorize this author as an erotic author.  That being said, there needs to be plot and sex.  Personally, I feel a little cheated out of my money when I get a book that looks like erotica, but is just one or two sex scenes filled with plot that is not very good.  Here, I think you actually have a good balance of the two.So why only 3.5 stars?  Because I never went back and re-read this.  There are other Barbara Elsborg books that I have read and re-read and re-read.  Mostly her shorts, such as Snow Play and Power of Love.  I think she really does do short stories very well, and also, her novels tend to be on the longer side.WARNING/SPOILER: this is a story about Lucy and Three's relationship.  However, there is also MM sex in this book, although it doesn't involve Three.",0
"Sure wish books carried x rating as do movies.  I only read the first few pages and deleted after about the fourth ""F"" word in several pages along with references to other body parts.  Yeah, I know I shouldn't rate a book I didn't complete, but someone has to give a review to warn others who don't thrive on gutter language. I can handle books like those from Stuart Woods with sexual references, but don't need the four letter word frequency this book offers.  I expected this to be an interesting story line about a reformed jewel thief with perhaps a warm love interest.",0
Not even a story. Don't even know where to start about this it begins and ends in 5 minutes. Well at least it was free.,0
"I can't believe I didn't review this book when I read it years ago.  I really did enjoy it because it was a new kind of concept for me.  If I had reviewed it years ago, I would be able to give it a more thorough and enthusiastic review, but I think people should give it a shot if they enjoy the genre.",1
"I bought this at the Samhain website (had a coupon from the RWA conference) and was extremely impressed. This was my first reading of this author and I thought she did a fantastic job for a short story. In fact I was just up here on Amazon looking for something else of hers to read and saw that this book has only a 3 star rating... shocked me into writing my own review!The other reviews have done a good job of recounting the plot here, so I'll just say that I think the story was very well written, dark and steamy with a nicely executed HEA. It stumbled a little bit at the black moment, but not enough to throw me off.If the story sounds intriguing to you, give it a shot. She's a wonderful writer.",1
Very well written.  I could hardly put it down and would love to read more of this family struggle to happiness.,1
This book was fairly well written. The pace was solid and I enjoyed the characters. Looking forward to reading the next book.,1

"First of all, I must reiterate the warning that this is a title from Samhain Pub., which means that it is very sexually explicit! So you have been forewarned.Beckett de Saxby, his cousin Colin, and Christiana had been friends throughout childhood. But when Beckett returns from war, he is a far different man from the young one that Christiana idolized. Now is hardened and cold, and he often spends his nights with women of loose morals, or drunk. She doesn't understand how he can hear about the bands of marauders hounding the people in the countryside around them, without doing something about it.Christiana had grown to be such a beauty, and he has tried to keep her out of his thoughts, but he was losing the fight. He promotes her up in the household, making the other maids furious. After she is attacked, he takes care of her personally, and warns of serious consequences if something happens again. He thinks it only lust in the beginning, but she has always loved him.When Beckett's prospective bride arrives with mother and brother in tow, things get interesting. Christiana is heartbroken, but gamely continues on. When she is kidnapped, a knight in black armor rescues her; thankful for his timely interruption, she kisses the black knight on the cheek.Can he be jealous of himself? After the kiss, Beckett pulls away from Christiana, thinking that she might have given the black knight something else if he had asked for it.Watch as Beckett falls passionately in love with Christiana, the servant.

"My Soul To Lose is a good introduction to the first book in the Soul Screamers series. It's not necessary that you read it before My Soul To Take, but I do recommended it.This book tells us the story of Kaylee and her life at the mental institution where she was admitted after a certain incident at the mall with her bestfriend Emma. I easily sympathized with her and I easily loved Emma for being a very supportive friend. I am curious with one character in this book though--Lydia. She's mysterious and yet she seems to know Kaylee's secret and she's the only person in the institute who can understand her. I'm curious about what happened to her after she helped Kaylee and it would be great to know more about her in the next books. Though it's short and easy read, this book give us glimpse of Kaylee's life before she knows the truth behind her  so called ""panic attacks"". You'll be able to understand her better and it will answer some of the questions you might have when you read the first book in the series.I hope you'll take the time to read this novella. I can't say anything more about it and I don't want to give anything away that may spoil your future reading. It's good and it's enjoyable. I recommend it and I think it's best to read it before you start My Soul To Take. Nevertheless, you can still start the series and read it afterwards. :)",1
"The story was a good one.  Many, many editing errors and a great deal of inconsistency with the character. Liked the concept, but kept getting bogged down.",0
The cover fit perfect but I did not know at the time once is was on there were no instructions to remove it. When I had to replace my Kindle Dx I did not remove I just shipped it back along with my Kindle . I did not want to damage the unit. I feel getting the replacement  Kindle Dx more than compensated for the small I\price for the cover. I would advise Amazon to include removal instruction so when you want to change covers it can be done . As always happy to do business with Amazon. AABoulet,0

"I downloaded this for my Kindle not knowing what to expect.  It just sounded like an interesting book.  I really ended up enjoying this book a lot.  It is a very classic fantasy tale with a lot of humor woven throughout.Wistril and his apprentice, Kern, live in Castle Kauph and in general just want to be left alone to their studies.  In these three stories about Wistril, that is just not meant to be. The three stories included are Wistril Besieged,Wistril Afloat, and Wistril Betrothed.  In each story Wistril shows that brain always triumphs over brawn and comes up with humorous solutions to rather difficult situations.I thoroughly enjoyed these stories.  Wistril is a pretentious, yet caring and hilarious wizard.  He constantly surprises the reader with his crazy solutions to problems.  Kern is a very competent apprentice who weaves tons of hilarious sarcasm throughout the novel.  Wistril is sworn, as a white wizard, to never harm with his magic and this adds an interesting twist to things.Tuttle has a very readable writing style that I really enjoyed.  He develops wonderfully quirky characters.  These stories really have a classic kind of tongue-in-cheek dungeon crawling humor to them.  I was pleasantly surprised and very amused.Overall I absolutely loved this book.  I immediately went online and got a couple more of Tuttle's Kindle books.  If you love classic fantasy with a humorous twist you have to check out this book.",1
"This book is, as we say in the south, a hot mess.  The ideas in it have potential but they are never fully realized.  Most of the characters are flat, not fleshed out, and I had a hard time giving a damn either way about them.  The book is 90% dialogue with little or no real narration on things.  (What kind of dog is Spike?)  Katherine is a sniveling mess a good deal of the time.  Parts of it are just sex scene after sex scene (Which is better written than most Laurel K Hamilton sex scenes, so at least that's a bonus.).  The end fight seemed very anti-climatic and predictable.  I really wish the ideas and characters had been fleshed out more.  In the end I had a hard time getting thru it and was very glad I had gotten it for free.",0

That was terrible. It might have been good if it had been an actual story instead of a couple chapters and then an end that wasn't even an end. Awful. I will not read this author again.,0
Another story about misidentification and confusion.  When everyone finally gets everything straight all ends well for the people involved.  It was okay.,0
"This one was better than First Contact. It concentrated more on story than on just fighting. I have a gripe about Tesh-Dar. In this prequel series, we keep getting ""told"" how mighty Tesh-Dar is. I got tired of the repetition quickly. Fine, the author wants to change his mythos in these prequels. I guess that is his prerogative, but it just feels wrong if the reader still remembers the other three books. It undoes the logic and therefore the suspension of disbelief. Tesh-Dar can walk through walls, send herself through space, but can't get out from under a cave-in???? Even taking into account that she was 100 years older, in the first three books, it just doesn't feel like it makes sense anymore. I'm going to finish this series (I bought them), but I really feel like this is not a prequel series worthy of the first three books. I really wish that this prequel series had just been about Tesh-Dar's life. What brought her to the point of not killing Reza when she first found him?",0
"***SPOILERS***The h is the fat girl of her class and is still bitter about never being asked out by the H.  She returns to town thinner and ready to rub it in the H face.  That lasted about a chapter, maybe 2.  I have really enjoyed the this author's previous work and was looking forward to a what I thought would be a story about a reluctant h and a remorseful H that had to woo the h back in love with him.  Since this never happened, I am not sure why the book had this title.  Other than the H carrying a box for the h and giving her a kitten, there really was no wooing at all.  They have sex and then he reacts like a total jerk after they are done but instead of apologizing he gives her a lame line of ""what I did was unforgivable so I am not going to ask you to forgive me.""  This was after he has locked her in a jail cell for her to listen to him (his the sheriff).  I guess even after what she did I thought that how he acted he needed to get on his knees to beg for forgiveness and really showing remorse instead of acting high handed but he continually doubts and compares the h to the actions of his ex-wife.  When the h intervenes between his daughter and him, the H immediate response is ""you told her,"" referring to a secret that the H had shared with the h regarding the daughter.  She let's that go and then later in the book he also questions her honesty regarding a major event which to me was just the last straw.  He is just one of those characters that because he had been burned once before and therefore will forever continue to think the worse of all women, the h included.  He never once believed the best of the h nor did he really have to ever work for the h love.  Instead the H continually took her for granted.  The h is just disappointing because throughout the book she stand up to the H just long enough to give lip service just before she lays down to be his doormat.  The end was just so unbelievably annoying that I didn't even read the last two pages.  Yes, I had two pages to go and I just could not do it.  H shows up after continually treating the h like crap and hurting her and in one paragraph all is fine and well, until the next time that life doesn't go his way and then somehow that will be the h fault again and I'm sure she will agree with that as well.  The only time he steps up is when someone else wanted her or if it was easy and convenient to him, this to me this a romance does not make.  This book was just a huge disappointment especially from such a talented author.",0
"This is another of the old classics that Amazon has released in eBook format.  I read this story first over fifty years ago while it was being held between the hardback bindings of a library book in conjunction with Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and In Search of the Castaways.  After I discovered how exciting Jules Verne's writings truly were I started reading all of his books that I could find and I most certainty appreciated every one of them.  When I saw ""The Mysterious Island"" in eBook format on Amazon I simply had to have a copy.  It is now my desire to acquire all the books that I have read and the books I now have in my personal hard-copy library, in the eBook format.  Even though we have grown up reading hardback and paperback books, enjoying the smell of printer's ink and experiencing the feeling of a good binding and fine paper in our hands, we no longer are able to collect them in their original format due to lack of available shelf space.  I have discovered that being able to carry all of my books around in my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is not a bad way to go after all.  Hunting through book shelf after book shelf for a novel or digging through box after box of books which we had to place in storage because our books were completely taking over our home, looking for just the right book, has unfortunately become unrealistic. However I regress and this is a review about Jules Verne and his book ""The Mysterious Island""  Read it, I believe you will love it.",1
"Despite the corny feel of that game, gay chicken?, this book was definitely worth a read. And a re-read. Maybe even a third. Because that's how hot these two guys were together. Also, the attraction didn't feel forced. I thought it flowed perfectly :)Fakkit, I'll probably read it a fourth time, too.",1
"I loved reading this story!!  At first the reader would think that Brock is just to good to be true but by the middle of the book, you find your self cheering for the happy family.  I was sad when the story ended because I wanted so badly to know what happens next with the three of them.  If you are looking for a heart warming story, this is a MUST!!",1
"I haven't used the advice yet, but it's bound to come in handy sooner or later. Glad I downloaded it. This way I'll have it when I need it.",0
this is a cute short story meant as light hearted fun. would recommend to anyone interested in manage and bdsm.,1
"I like ""any-were"" stories and this was a really good read for an afternoon. The characters are realistic and the villain rotten enough to make it exciting. I will be reading more of this author's work in the future.",1
Just finished Delver magic Book I: Sanctum's Breach and for the most part I really enjoyed it. Toward the end I became so involved that I nearly missed my bus stop. There were a few things however that kept this from being a 5. First of all Mr Inlo must have taken his eye off the sword at one point. There were only three human women in the book and he still called Lauren Rachel. I guess he nearly missed his bus stop too. Another problem I had with the book (and this is probably just personal problem) I became a little agravated when I was really getting into one plot line and all of a sudden jumped to another one. I know all areas had to be covered but sometimes it was a little disjointed. I have the next three books and I know I will enjoy them as well.,1
"Although one of the main characters was emotionally challenged, I did enjoy this book and the storyline...I found it to be a quick easy read.",0
"It started out well. . . okay, it started out okay.  They already knew each other.  But he was lying to her from the get go.  Sure she lied about her age but come on shouldn't he have been able to tell or did she just come across with the maturity of a 24 year old ALL the time?  He lied about everything else!  He lied about who, what, and where he was from.  Then he was very hurtful to her.  Basically telling her that what they shared wasn't anything!  So yeah I was glad when she was able to set up a life for herself and her child without being dependant upon him for anything.  I think she carried a torch for him though.  Not ever really getting close to anyone else over the years, however he didn't seem to mind keeping up with the type of relationships that he labeled theirs through the years.  Was he just trying to replace her?  Maybe. . .probably what the author wanted the reader to believe at any rate yet it did fall short on that.  What really irked me was the fact that soon after he threatend the press getting involved . . . low and behold there they are.  All that time before the reporters could care less about his women let alone whether or not he had a secret love child or not.  Who told the press?  Oh yeah and then he tries to come off as the hurt party trying to do right by Charlie yet did he really?  That was when she lost it for me.  Why didn't she just tell her side of the story.  How she was an 18 year old virgin, hooked up with a 26 year old playboy who dumped her after getting her pregnant.  Oh yeah and the even bigger question, if he is such a hot commodity how come he didn't have any bodyguards protecting Charlie and Gina from would be kidnappers who would be out to make a fast buck????",0
"""The Virgin"" reads like it was written by a novice/ beginner and isn't properly researched.  The wearing of the wimple began in the early Middle Ages, not before, and certainly not in Judea of the time. Nuns retained the medieval dress, including the wimple, until Vatican II or shortly thereafter.The beginning seemed all right, but it just got silly after that.  I had read The Keep and thought it was pretty good and then thought I'd try another, since it was in my recommendations.  I really don't know how people could give this sophomoric novel a 5 star rating. But, different people respond to a work in different ways.I thought it had an interesting premise and am drawn to Marian themes, Catholicism and mysticism in general but this was just a ridiculous plot.I've downloaded a few other of his novels that seemed interesting and will try those to see if his work has improved any.Update:  Although I didn't think much of this novel, another reviewer mentioned how good the 'Repairman Jack' series was - and it really is.  I've read three of them now and am on my fourth, and they are as good, and probably better, than any crime/suspense series out there.  What a nice surprise.  Really excellent and highly recommended.  And he is offering them at a really reasonable price - so if you're fed up paying upwards of $15 for a Kindle thriller, try this series.",0
"This author blows me away.  Just when I start to think there are no more novels out there that will thrill me, I come across this one.  It's not just the story but the writing style, the pacing, and the way she leads you to care so much about the characters.  God's Eye was a completely different kind of book but I loved that one just as much.  I need to read this author's other work.  Immediately.",1
"This book was enjoyable, nothing outstanding, but again if you just want to escape into fantasy land, this is a good book.  I will probably read it again.",0
"The Belkin Neoprene cover is a slip cover that looks a lot more expensive than it costs. It is durable, roughed, and slim to fit the Kindle DX. It's great to stuff into luggage or to carry in a briefcase or computer case in travel and light enough to be carried with the DX by itself.",1
"I was not really all that impressed. The story was too short, not enough background on the characters. Needs more depth",0
"I got about two pages into this before giving up. The style is clunky, the internal monolog doesn't gel with the character we know, and the story starts at the end of a chase scene that probably would have been really interesting if the author had bothered to write it.",0
"I read a lot of the independent authors that publish on Amazon and generally don't mind if a book is not quite what I expected but with this book I am really really sorry I wasted the .99The idea/premise of this book is not a bad one, the actual execution of the story is a whole different matter.The dialogue was childish and stilted and read more like a high school drama.  The main character is 22 years old and comes off as a high school Buffy wanna be....with some good editing work this could be a good story....but as it is now...don't waste your money.",0
This was a good read. You always find a romance happening in the office but this was nice and you wanted to find out how it ended. It makes you wish your office romance turned out the same way.,1
"Have you ever been blind? I wonder if the author has? I am partially blind. The thoughts, fears, joys the author writes about are all realistic. Especially the time at the park with Paul, Faith and Christina. Due to a brain aneurysm, I was blind in both eyes until time and operations made it possible for me to see with one eye. I can remember very vividly standing in the middle of a busy sidewalk and freaking out (mentally) because I couldn't see and I didn't know where my son had gone.  This book was very good. The only drawbacks I did not like were  the bed scenes and the scenes with Kathleen and the other woman(I forgot her name);I thought these were unnecessary.I hope the author writes more books!",1
I am hooked.  Read the first fifteen of the Westmorelands. Loved all of them.  Are you putting the nest set in a group.  Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"This is the first three of the blood runner books.  You can read the series out of order, but it's awesome to read them in order- if you can.  Reading the bundle, is like reading one huge really good story- in three acts.",1
"I am a huge Debbie Macomber fan, there's not too many books of hers that I haven't read.  After saying that, her best writing, in my opinion is her Cedar Cove series.  With 12 books total, the books follow a cast of characters through life and hardships.  The series starts with 16 Lighthouse road and ends with 1225 Christmas Tree Lane.  It's easy to know where you are in the series based on the title - the first number in the title is the corresponding number in the series.  Debbie Macomber's characters draw you in and make you feel as though you are part of the plot and by the time you have finished the book(s) you feel as though some of the characters are you best friends as with Olivia and Grace.  You meet them in 16 Lighthouse Rd and 204 Rosewood.  If you download this book/series, you won't be sorry.  Curl up in your favorite reading chair and be transported to Cedar Cove.  Enjoy!",1
"Bought the book on Amazon suggestion. Seems like the author was preaching at me throughout the book.  Decently written, but will probably not purchase from this author again, not my style.",0
"If you are interested in reading a book that only has sex in it with no clear plotline beyond segueing into more sex, than by all means, this book is for you.  However, if you are interested in love and romance, steer clear because this book is not what you are looking for.  I am an avid reader of all things romance, and I, too, can appreciate well written love scenes.  Unfortunately for me, this book had nothing more to offer.",0
"""Under the Eagle"" is the first novel in a series of novels dealing with Centurion Macro and Optio (""Second in Command"") Cato.  The novel opens with Cato, a gangling teenager, inducted into the Roman Army in Germany with a letter of introduction from Rome insisting that he immediately be made a Centurion.  General Vespasian balks at this notion but compromises by making Cata an ""Optio"" which is essentially a Centurion's second in command and assistant.  Macro and Cato's skills compliment one another since Macro is illiterate, which he takes pains to conceal, while Cato is a bookworm.  Most of the novel deals with Cato's coming of age as a competent Roman soldier and fighting-man.The writing in this novel is quite good, the plot is linear without becoming too passe, and the characterizations are very good.  The author does a good job giving the reader a flavor for what it must have been like to be a Roman soldier in post-Republican Rome.  I liked this novel well enough to pick up the second installment in the series.  RJB.",1
"This was a re-read for me and was as enjoyable as the first time. Very good stories and characters that held my attention throughout. I am not a fan of 1st person type of narration, but was able to read these books easily, with only an occasional bit of aggravation.  I do recommend this bundle. The two follow up books-----not so much.",1
The concept of this story was very interesting two friends being captivated with two individuals only to find that they are one and the same. The characters are similar yet complex at the same time. The story very unique in its development. I truly enjoyed the characters and wished the story had not ended so soon.,1
"Another great read in this series. I absolutely loved the first one and had to have the second and I was not disappointed. If anything it had only hooked me on this series even more. I love the characters and how everything interacts and flows together. It's written really well and I'm able to just immerse myself in the story and the world that has been created and I don't want to leave, even when the book is done. There is plenty of action in this story to keep your attention.  Now to get the next one :).",1
It took me a long time to get through this one.  It gives a wonderful account of his life because he wrote it. Great book!  I recommend it for anyone to add to their reading list of biographies.,1
"I only got about halfway through this book before giving up. The character development was poor, and the storyline boring.",0
"I really like the way they got along, separate but together. How friends became lovers. They weren't afraid to express their feelings. I will read this book again.",1
"Not sure of the polyamorus * storyline but, I did enjoy the world the author created. I may have found a new genre.",0
"It was a short, sweet, sexy read. Worth the money. I liked her style of writing & will look for more by this author.",1
"This was an entertaining, funny book and a fast read. If you're looking for a mindless, light escape for a few hours, this can fit the bill. However, I found the lack of editing a bit distracting. There were grammatical mistakes, typos, verb tense changes, etc. scattered throughout the book. I skipped over most of them, but some tripped me up while I was reading. However, given that I got this book for free, it was worth it.",1
"This is the worst book I have read from this Author. I have enjoyed her series before like the powertools. This however is just crap!!Becca is a student/graduate now doctor in a physiology practice on a college campus. Kurt is the doctor. Both have a thing for each other and she volunteers for an sexual experiment. The dream machine can record her dreams and hers are about Kurt.Seriously though the language the girl/woman uses is inappropriate for such a repressed character. How they talk to each other in the experiments is pathetic, who hell says I'm going to take you now?'It was just a novel of soft porn with bondage and sex toys chucked in. I couldn't even finish it.Poorly done Ms Rylon and I normally enjoy your books",0
"I read a lot of the other reviews before I started this book.  I was absolutely fascinated by the number of 'love it' and 'hate it' reviews, and how varied they  were, and I finally had to read it for myself to find out.  There was also the discussion about editing, and the errors that were rife through the book, with the author assuring us that an editor had been brought on board, and the book no longer has issues.In a 'light' fun read, I overlook some errors, and try not to dwell on them.  Life's too short to nit pick.  But I'm afraid more editing is still needed in this book.  I believe the author is serious about her craft, and wants to write more books, so I'm sure she will want to make sure her product is as good as it can be.  That will keep people coming back for more.As a story, there wasn't enough depth for the length of the book.  The story was fine, but long, detailed discussions of each meeting or encounter took up too much of the book.  I can accept someone getting that head over heels feeling at first sight, but looks are not enough to carry a long term relationship, or being ""in love"", and there was very little development of the characters beyond the ""mile wide back and rippling muscles"" and hair that smells like coconut.  And some details shifted somewhat in the book - Avery was 5'9, then 5'10, then 5'9 again.  I didn't pay a lot of attention to her physical appearance, but felt the author did not have a firm grip on how the characters looked either.  I like to imagine the characters for myself, but get thrown when the details don't add up, or don't remain consistent. Many times, I had an impression the heroine was a tiny, petite girl, (with an a cup bra size) but then a height of 5' 9"" (or 10"") and size 9.5 shoes isn't petite at all. And how many shades of brown can one head of hair be?There were spots where it looks like an attempt at editing was made, and corrected text was inserted, but not all of the old text was removed.  I do think the author has potential.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have attempted to pinpoint the things about this book that kept it from earning a higher rating from me. Another round of editing could easily bring the grade up another point or two.  The author does have a talent for descriptive scenes, and the reader will feel they are part of them.  But technical errors distract, and jar me back to reality, spoiling the effect of the scene she had spun.  I feel this author will take reader feedback, and continue towards excellence.",0
Cardboard characters. Not worth wasting time on.Amazon required extra words so I can submit the review and read something good.,0
"Just for the pure enjoyment and entertainment factors, I loved SERIAL.  It is very graphic with violence, but I didn't think it was much worse than some of the thrillers that are out there today that I've read.  The two authors collaborating on this agreed that one mind was as sick as the other, and I'll agree, but I think the plot of two serial killers working alone and then what happens when the two of them meet up is very clever.  I read this very fast because I couldn't wait to see what happened.  This isn't SERIAL UNCUT, but a shorter version of it.  If these two writers intended to make me feel a little creepy, unnerved, like I had to keep reading, and totally entertained, then they accomplished their goal.  If you love thrillers and horror, something that gives you a very unsettled feeling, then this is for you. This is the first time I've seen the term ""recreational murder"" in any kind of mystery or suspense thriller.  I hope that's one term that doesn't become popular.There are three other excerpts from books included:  Desert Places by Blake Crouch, Shaken by J.A. Konrath, Draculas by J.A. Konrath, Jeff Strand and F. Paul Wilson.There is a list of each authors' works that are available for the Kindle at the end of the last excerpt. I didn't recognize the name of J.A. Kornrath, but he's the author of the Jack Daniels thriller series which includes Whiskey Sour and Bloody Mary.  I've read Whiskey Sour and enjoyed that one.  The authors are not unknown authors, and if you like things that go bump in the night or even in the daytime, then SERIAL is a good choice for a free download.",1
It Is Just My Opinion But I Did Not Like This Book At All. I Pretty Much Rushed Through It And I Have Not Read It Since. I Don't Even Want To Continue The Series...,0
"This story has all the elements of a good erotic romance and then some, i.e. humor.  I was delighted and enchanted with this uber sexy spin on a childhood favorite.  Should definitely be read by fans of erotic romance.  The plot is not complex but I was Wooed by it's sensuality.  Well, I'm off to, not see the wizard you silly goose, off to find another book by R.G. Alexander. Enjoy!p.s. On second thought, maybe I'll dash across the rainbow and find my own ""Z"" Yum!",1
"I really liked  the idea behind the book, but got really bored reading the book. Even if I had read the ""real"" book instead of the excerpt from the Kindle Download, the way she wrote and what she wrote just really bored me.",0
"This book offers a lot! It is funny, serious, and at times sad.  But the author really does a great job joining all of the characters into the forefront.  You should read the first two that come before it so you don't miss anything and you will have a much better understanding of what is going on with this ""Monster"".  I really enjoyed the way the characters were brought to life and the consistency in the story line.  Good job Ms. Dubois!",1
"The writing and characters are so juvenile I did not even get more than a couple chapters into this book. Free or not, my time would have been better spent doing something else.",0
"A very cute story of intrigue, and jealously.A quick read and would gladly read this author again.Till next time.",1
"No real story line, but did not expect one either.  Good simple read with some hot sex.  Gotta love a main character that has tat's and piercings.",0
"3.5 stars.I have to confess that I don't really know what to think. There are a lot of wonderful ideas in this story and I think they deserved more space to develop because some of the situations, especially those on the dream plane, faded to black and then came back too abruptly. Instead of the confusion of the main character, I was left only with a sense of disorientation.The setting was really fantastic. The story takes place on a train and the other protagonist is a mysterious man, part magician, part healer. Marco Satori is a very interesting character and he makes you hold your breath when he appears on the page. And he's very sexy.Edwin, from whose point of view we see the story, is melancholic and in need of salvation and Marco gives him awareness and also a spark of will to change the situation he is in.There is a paranormal twist, and it was a big thing, with a lot of information that made me crave for a longer story. I was left with the impression I was given only a teasing, abridged version of a great book.Beautifully written.",1
This is a small easy to carry charger for the car.  It doesn't get in the way of other functions in the car and protects the Kindle for overcharging.,1
"This book was very detailed and interesting..  I felt at times the characters were doing too much. It was very erotic,but I got bored in some places.  I was tired for Savannah!  Get this book especially if it is free.  Good Read!",0
"Just when I thought Not in Kansas was good. She had to take the hunky Wizard from the first book. Dump him right smack in the middle of California with a woman named Dorothy. A shy, curvy, and push over female that also happens to be a witch. A very powerful witch that is also the soul mate to said hot `Wizard of Oz'. After a fantastic `light bondage' (no ropes, think invisible bondage Wizard of Oz style) the Wizard is summoned back to Oz, and leaves our poor Dorothy with a way into Oz if she should need to come to him.This story was laced with hot erotic scenes and was even better than Not in Kansas. It added in more elements of the original story, you get a takes of Glinda, some `flying monkeys', and other mystical creatures that all over sexed and aren't ashamed of it. Let me tell you, if I had known that Oz was the land of sex, I would have hopped on the first Twister and taken my happy butt there a long time ago.I think this story had more of a pleasing effect on me because of the light bondage and spanking that was in it. This was one of the most pleasing erotic romances I have read in a very long time. The fantasy was great, the storyline was new and fresh, and I wish she would write just ONE MORE in this series so I can sit back and indulge in another trip to the land of Oz.Review also found at: [...]",1
"This book was too over the top for my tastes.  After reading 50 Shades of Grey, I am okay with reading TASTEFUL BDSM story lines.  This book contains two men/one woman sex scene that I couldn't personally stomach.  Not for me.  I deleted this from my Kindle app quickly.",0
"I'm shocked at all the five star reviews. It was a beauty and the beast type book but the beauty apparently wasn't all that beautiful. The most aggravating part was the back and forth between the main characters, should I tell him this, I should have told her that, I want him to kiss me, I don't dare kiss her, over and over. She thought she was ugly, he kept referring to himself as a monster. We get it.The mystery part was so poorly done, I wondered if it was a last minute addition to lengthen the story. The main characters weren't bad, but the story surrounding them was. It could have used an editor, as well.Unfortunately, I couldn't recommend this to anyone.",0
"At the beginning, I thought this had somewhere to go. I was especially sorry that Finn wasn't allowed to say goodbye to his deceased boyfriend becase of homophobic parents. Then Officer Steve steps in and becomes a ""white knight."" But then a hot bout of necking was the end of the story (but you do know Finn's going home with Steve). This was majorly short. I was also annoyed that the story ends at location 476 and the rest of the book is filled with samples of other works. So almost 200 locations are just publicity. This seems to be de riguer for A.J. Hardcourt.",0
Have always loved these stories and hope they will endure.  Make believe is something we all need in these tense times.,1
"I just finished this book and, quite frankly, I had trouble putting it down during parts of it and trouble picking it up again during others. Some places the story got bogged down but for the most part I enjoyed the book. The characters were well defined and interesting but the story seemed to lack a point, a goal, for them to get to for the first 3/4 of the book. Once that was established the story came together very well.I, too, found the typos very distracting; several times making me stop and reread a sentence a few times to try to figure out what it was supposed to say. I probably would have rated it 4 stars except for so many errors and some inconsistancies. I find with my Kindle I don't flip back to compare parts of the book as much so I sometimes get a little confused when things don't quite fit from one chapter to another, i.e., the same thing someone else noted regarding Sam's name.All that  being said I was disappointed that the next book was not yet available. That actually says more for my review then anything else. I want more!",0
"I know a lot of reviewers read this book not fully realising what it was, but I had read the Amazon reviews, and knew what it was about, and decided to give it a go anyway.Basically, this is a sequel, and doesn't work as a standalone, at all. I get that sequels are for people who have read the first book, but a little backstory never hurt anyone. There is *none* in this book, and given that it's free, I think there should have been an expectation that this would be peoples' introduction to the series.So, anyway, Holly is eight months pregnant, and 'married' to three brothers who won't have sex with her because they're afraid of hurting her, or the baby.Eventually she manages to convince (i.e. corner and threaten with 'the wrath of a hormonal woman') two of the brothers, and have sex with them. Only one of these sex scenes appear in the book, the other fades to black.Eventually, she has the baby and everyone ends up happily ever after. The description of the birth is a little...graphic for my taste. I would much rather have read about that second sex scene than listen to one of the brothers try to make sure Holly had passed the placenta *shudder*What's really irritating, is the extract at the end of this book is intriguing, but because of the lack of characterisation, backstory and world-building (I know it's not fantasy, but there is zero description of Holly's location and surroundings), means I won't read that book.I only finished this book because it was mercifully short, and I would have felt very guilty giving up on a short story.",0
"Blind faith is a very heart warming tale. At the begining of the story the doctor finds his wife in bed with a coworker. After the divorce he is drawn towards a blind patient in the ER. The doctor learns that he has to put his trust in God before he can truely commit to one person again. This is a cleaner romance story. Although there are a few sex secenes they are not X rated, and I really enjoyed it.",1
"This was a one-time cursory look.  If one is interested only in what is going onin Washington and what is dished to the regular press, this is good to read.",0
"Rating the opening of a serial is difficult to do piece by piece, I am optimistic the book will improve, but the opening was confusing with so much pushed into limited space.  I blame the failure on poor editing.",0
"I already wrote a review under one of the other novella's in the series so check that out... First of all, calling these novella's is just a way to get people to pay more for a serialized version of a regular book.. imagine paying 99 cents a chapter.... because that is what you are doing... I think he's up to 5 or 6 now..Then of course there is the basic story line... as he explains in a forward in a novella one only bothers to really develp 2 main characters.... so there is no character development other than these two... and I would argue there is very little of that as well.. Further, there are very poor relationships between not only these two characters but also the other characters in teh story.  the wife is non existent.  the daughter is a monster.. there are no friendships... the second character follows the 'prince' apparently out of fear and a hope... that he will eventually get to fixing their lands main problem... very very dark dreary stuff here... bodies dead and alive and re awakened from the dead and re killed all over the place.... if I was a person in this land I would leave there as soon as possible and fight on the other side....these people are not rationally motivated... none of them",0
"I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't help but laugh at Zack. He was a billionaire, and used to everyone doing what he said. He just assumed that Arielle would marry him because she was pregnant with his twins. He was willing to give her everything, and anything except for the only thing she wanted was for him to love her. Zach cared for Arielle, and pampered her non stop. He just couldn't love her, in fear of his heart being broken again. He planned a wedding in a week... I had to laugh at all he was doing, and just shaking my head as I read, thinking to myself Zach, Zach, Zack...Wake up. No one would marry him the way he was acting. Once his sister talked to him, he viewed thing differently, and woke up. In the end everything worked out. Really entertaining story, if you want to laugh at the charactors you are reading about...",0
"I actually really liked this story, but of course I'm somewhat biased since I love Ms. Vaughn's books.  Even though I felt that the heroine was a total doormat to everyone in her office, the hero and even her live-in cousin, I think she finally redeemed herself at the end. Love the inner dialogue as well when the heroine tells off certain people in her office.  Sometimes I'm thinking the same thing when people are intruding upon my work time as well.  Recommended read.",1

"Tabitha was married to Craig with whom she shares 2 kids with but he was addicted to the Internet chatting he never physically cheated on her but he was emotionally. She ended things but continued to sleep with him while dating other men AND sleeping with them as well. Craig keeps trying to get back with Tabitha she refuses him. Craig meets Grace starts dating her, Tabitha gets mad, he falls in love with a Grace, Tabitha keeps sleeping with him. He wants to finalize the divorce to marry Grace, Tabithat gets superly angry all the while meeting new guys to date and sleeping with them. Tabitha realizes that Craig's lies and deceit isn't as bad all the losers she's been dating so she wants to give it another try because she realizes she really does love him. Craig sleeps with her but after they have sex he thinks she's asleep and receives a text from his Fianc&eacute; of naked pictures saying she misses him. He responds to the  text WHILE laying in the bed with Tabitha saying "" I miss you too and can't for you to be Mrs. smith"" she cries herself to sleep and  blah blah blah!Tabitha was a mother of two who didn't know herself or what she wanted. She kept dating LOSER guys and screwing them all! There wasn't ONE guy she went on a date with and didn't screw! She was childish and immature acting and she made me sick. This book was so not worth the money heck it isn't even worth buying in my opinion. Maybe this book isn't for ppl in my age group Tabithat was 28 but she asked like an 16 yr old child. So this book to me read as that of an 16 yr old high school student who was just lost and needed to find herself. The book even ended horribly to me she didn't learn anything she was still single and still hating on the fact that Grace has taken her place in Craig's family and she wasnt that special anymore. Tabitha went through all this hell in her dating life to make it to the end of the book and she still had no growth.",0
"The stories were not bad but the story would have been a great read if the author would have focused on one story only.  A short story is presented,leaving the ending up to the reader.  We are then introduced to a couple of stories in an attempt to get us to buy them. I wouldn't buy them.",0
Pretty much a coming of age story in the violent west. Great good characters and bad and some twists of bad to good to keep you guessing. A little romance to stir the pot and an even pace to keep it interesting. A very good read...shu,1
"Satisfying romance. Reads more like a long short story or a novella than a true novel. The plot never rises above this couple and their attraction. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that it does that well, regardless of where else the book could have gone.The two characters are likeable and attractive. The heat between then rises from the page. The few supporting characters and the dialogue between them all is just good enough to keep you smiling.This is a light read- candy-bar book, as I call it- but a good one. I felt it would have been nice if we had gotten to know our heroine as her own wolf, but the book never makes it that far. I imagine we'll get a chance to in later books in the series though. She was just as strong a character as any of the men.Nicely done- just don't go looking for any more than a bit of furry romance and some light comedy and you'll really enjoy this.",1
"This book caught my interest immediately.  Then, all of a sudden, I realized I didn't like him very much and she was really whiny.  I'll check out one more sibling but if its not better I will not purchase the rest of the series",0
Each and every one of these stories keeps you on the edge of your seat! I like series that intertwine all of the characters from the previous books so there is continuity and history to draw from. I love the strong female characters and how love conquers in the end. Lots of sizzle if you are into that sort of thing.,1
"Two stars because it was a good concept, however I felt like English was a second language for the author. Very stilted brittle sentences. The love scenes were not very smooth needs more. Keep at it though this was close,and a good idea.",0
It's really short but it has potential & it's more interesting than Wandering Koala Challenges The Scientific Method. If your going to download just one of the Wandering Koala free books I'd pick this one.,0
"I liked this story, in fact I love all of Delilah Devlin's western stories. This book has some kinky bizniz happening, my imagination is clearly limited and I love a book that goes out there, after all that is why I am not a writer myself. I love romances and this book is a short but sweet romance, I liked both the heroes and the heroine, I wish there were more to the story though. I would recommend this book.",0
"After moving from Santa Fe to Asheville to start a new job, Thomas Stone is not pleased to find out the club he's supposed to be managing isn't opening yet.  Broke and in need of a place to stay, Thom sets off to find a temporary job.  He ends up finding a job bartending at The Happy Onion, a vegan restaurant.  He celebrates by going out to a club, intending to get laid.Philip Sorrells is bored with the scene at his favorite hangout, at least until a hot young man walks in the door.  He's more than glad to pick the guy up, and the night and morning that follow are incredible.  Things get weird, however, when he learns his one-night stand is working at his restaurant.  Phil wants to pursue a relationship with Thom, but Thom's reluctant to have any sort of relationship with a boss.  Other issues intrude as well.  Can these two very different men figure out a way to be together?The Happy Onion has a little something for everyone.  There's humor, emotion, hot sex, and even some suspense.  The characters are all very likeable, especially the hot-tempered, young-looking Thom and Phil, whose delight in annoying Thom just to get a reaction made me snicker.  The conflicts between Thom and Phil struck me as realistic, especially given how different the two men were and how Phil felt about Thom's future employers.  Of course, the love scenes between them are hot and sometimes emotional as well.  While The Happy Onion won't be replacing Eight Arms to Hold You or Willow Bend as my favorite Ally Blue book, it was certainly an enjoyable read.  If you're a fan of Ms. Blue or just gay romance in general, you're sure to enjoy The Happy Onion just as I did.Cassiereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
I started reading this book and then read it every chance I had till the last page.  Imaginative plot coupled with great characters make this a worthwhile read.,1
"After reading the other readers reviews I think I might have a different impression of the book had I read the prequel to this story.  However, as it stands, I am left wondering where the HEA in this story is.  I must admit that threesome stories are not my cup of tea because I always feel someone is getting the short end of the stick and it is usually the h.  In this one the h definitely got left with a toothpick size stick.  (SPOILER)  She is left with a husband that IMO is not all that spectacular.  The guy hands her out without talking to her first or taking her into consideration at all.  He seems completely self-absorbed during the entire book and then doesn't even defend her when she is called a b***h.  This author is a real hit and miss for me and this one was a miss.  I wish that the h would have left her husband and find someone to cherish her.  Isn't that what romance is about?  Geesh!  If you want to read a threesome book where all the characters were on a more leveled out playing field I would recommend Laid Bare (Lauren Dane).",0
"Dragon Knights, Border Lair. Book 2 in the series. This book can be read alone, but is better if you start with the prequel The Dragon Healer or Book 1 Maiden Flight.  This book follows Belora's, Maiden Flight, mother Adora who has been reunited with her childhood friend and adopted mother Kelzy the dragon.  Adora finds love with her 2 Knights and there Dragon Partners.  The broad story line continues to unfold at a nice pace.  After reading this book, I was engaged enough in the story that I picked up the rest of the series to date, Keeper of the Flame.",1
"As far as fairy tales, there are no big surprises here, mostly typical fairy tale fare, which is not a bad thing, but they resembled European fairy tales so much in form and function, that I wonder if its the translation, or if indeed Indian fairy tales are just very similar to European ones.  If you enjoy European style mythology, then you will probably like this short set of tales.",1
"I  liked to compare these tales with the tales of other countries, much similarity, but different characters.  Educational in that sense.",0
"Every book that  I read in the Dragon Knights series just keeps getting better and better. The love between humans and dragons, and the companionship and trust they all share is something that we could all learn from. I am so looking forward to enjoying more books from Dragon Knights as the series continues. Thank you Bianca D'Arc for your wonderful imaginations, and allowing us to enjoy them with you!!!",1
"Can you review a novel that you didn't finish? If so, I found the writing extremely &#34;wooden&#34;. Sort of what you might expect from a freshm,an in a school of journalism.I didn't feel that it would get any better after the first two or three capters, so I stopped reading.",0
"Another book that I did not bother to finish before deleting it from the Kindle. When something like this happens, I just wonder what the editor was thinking with letting a manuscript like this go to publication in that shape? It read more like a galley proof than a finished novel.",0
The one rule of a short story is that it be short. lol.  I remember before The Wild's Call was released on kindle it was released chapter by chapter; week by week and I would anxiously wait for Monday to rush to my computer and log-on just to read it before work.It complements the trilogy perfectly.  It gives us the idea how the world was after the collapse but before the spirits completely set in.  I also loved the fast pacing and the character's growth didn't suffer at all due to the quick story flow.If you are going to read this trilogy I recommend you read this prequel as well.,1
"Young love true to its form... especially for a young feline girl that fell in love with a wolf. The wolf pure blood and he felt the same way, until his got sick. Then so much changed... a young girl left heartbroken and wolf left howling in dispair.A few years later they are both a bit older and wiser, and for Gionne comes a chance to have his little feline. For Jenna... did she still love Gionne, has he changed? she doesnt care not one wit if he has a mate.. right?? well if he thinks to boss her around he has another think coming, she literly purrs at that thought.Ive had this book a while in my stash... and very glad I ran across it, I loved it. The story just flowed and loved the characters especially Razi, Gionne's half sister (I bet she will have her own story) a bit of mystery a dab of danger, and some scenes that set the sheets a fire. Have fun I did enjoy!",1
"This was a fun read! Great entertainment and a book I couldn't put down. It was especially interesting because it was set in Eureka, CA. The town was depicted well and made me feel as if I was actually there and knew the characters. The clever ideas of what they did and how they did it was fun. I wanted to put on my red checkered flannel shirt to read this. Thanks for telling a good story.",1
"Three roommates (Heath, Colt and Kylie - the only female) who have been best friends since college, engage in a game called Tequila Truth (started since they were in college and only occurs on each other's birthday) that starts to change their relationship when they each play the game on Health's 25th birthday.  Upon hearing Kylie's answer to the game, the three of them have been focused on how to fulfill the sex fantasy that each roommate can't seem to get out of their minds, but haven't admitted to each other.  What I enjoyed about this book is that the storyline is based on the strong and convincing relationship among these characters, combined with the steamy but meaningful sex scenes that were all male/female focused even though it was a menage.  The only minor concern I had on the story is how readily the characters addressed the LT impact of a menage relationship.  This story had it all, and I would recommend it if you want a steamy yet satisfying romance!",1
This book was disappointing to read because it had the potential to be great. The biggest let-down was the inconsistencies in the story. The 'voice' of Nisey & Kalinda changed in the latter part of the book. A year-long feud is fixed in an hour long conversation. A hate-filled Hillary suddenly stopped hating. Nisey started using high protocol before starting her training yet was ignorant about a safe-word. Nisey had been trained by a highly respected senior Dom for 1 year yet didn't know how to talk to other Doms. And who has parents that refer to their daughters boyfriend as her 'Master'?????? The whole book had weird inconsistencies like these which detracted from the story. Another annoyance for me was the amount of angst in the story. It was like reading a soap opera with kink.,0
"It had been almost a year since Belle had been home to see her family, but she was determined to spend Christmas with them away from the disillusionment she felt about her job and current life.  She knew she had some serious decisions to make, but wanted to enjoy her family for just a little while.  Belle hadn't had a life at all.  She was working eighty hours a week with absolutely no friends or dates to take the pressure off.Belle Taylor had always had a crush on Rafe Bettencourt since she was a little girl.  They had been neighbors since before she had been born.  Even now grown up as an attorney, she felt the same tug at her heart when she was near him.  When she arrived home, her family was horrified at Belle's appearance.  She had lost a lot of weight, looked overly tired, and had the darkest circles under her eyes.  Rafe long considered family couldn't believe his eyes either.  He had stopped thinking of her as simply family since she had graduated from law school, and decided this was the time to make sure she knew she was his.  Rafe knew they had many issues to work out like the fact that they lived in two different towns, but he knew the time was right for them.Good Christmas story.  I liked both of the huge nosey overbearing families with deep connections to each other going back years.  The romance between Belle and Rafe just further cemented the bond between those families.",1

"This was a very poorly written book with a poorly developed plot. There were many run-on sentences, grammatical errors, and simplistic phrases/sentences. I had to force myself to finish it, thinking it would get better, but it never did. The ending appeared forced as if the book suddenly needed to be finished quickly.",0
"Definitely not what I expected. Cut to the chase quickly. A little romance, male bonding, tear jerked, happily ever after kind of story.",0
"I really enjoyed this book.  The main character was an odd one but it made the story interesting.  At first you think he is kind of a nut (maybe this is an understatement), but then he starts to look closer to normal which makes the ending of the book very good!All in all it is a good story, not too short not too long, and you don't want to put the book down because you want to know what happens next.  What else could you ask for?  I know the editing came up in other reviews but if I really like a book I don't even notice any problems.I will definitely check out other books by this author.",1
"Some editing issues and odd word usage... also a little contrived and heavy handed in spots.That said, despited a feeling of redundancy, I very much enjoyed this bundle as well as the fourth book, Dark Wolf Rising.HOT! HOT! HOT! Even if most of it is all tease! lolThese stories definitely got my motor running.I liked the characters, and the sub-plot running throughout the four books (though it was less of a factor in the fourth book.)The resistance/aversion push/pull is an effective device but I would have liked a bit more variation. One slightly annoying feature was how often a character decided to &#34;Go for it&#34; only to NOT go for it shortly thereafter.Still... I enjoyed them.",1
"This is the prequel to the Soul Screamers series  It's just an eBook novella and you certainly don't have to read it to start the series.This book introduces the main characters of Kaylee (the main character), her best friend Emma, Kaylee's cousin Sophie, and Kaylee's Aunt Val and Uncle Brendon and mentions Kaylee's classmate, Nash.It's a quick read, but it introduces you to Kaylee's unique problem, which is that she sometimes has uncontrollable screaming fits.  You'll find out why in the next book.It was a freebie on Kindle, so I snagged it and became intrigued by Vincent's writing.  I have seen this series compared to Twilight but that's just mean.  This is so much better!  Plus, I think it's a lot more like The Hollows series by Kim Harrison, which I highly recommend as well.",1
First off I'd like to mention to those that complain they were not forwarned about the fact that this was not a full length novel-must not have read the very beginning when the author clearly states that it is a novella-not a full length novel.I admire Pinter's writing style and his depth of characterization and plots. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because this type of genre is not my cup of tea.,0
"What a basically ""blah"" story. Neither of the characters are especially interesting, the violence isn't at all effective (and of questionable reality in certain areas), there's no motivation for what's going on and basically just not much here to like.This story perpetuates one of the great myths of serial killers; that they love doing what they do and will snicker about how gloriously EVIL they are while doing it. We have two serial killers who like doing their thing through the medium of hitchhiking; one as a driver and the other as a passenger. When they meet up, it's like ""Frankenstein vs the Wolfman"", only even less interesting. I also find it vaguely amusing that the violence is quite graphic, but the sexual content is glossed over quickly, as per the usual for American audiences.There's some real potential here as a plot idea, but the execution, as it were, is terrible. I have no interest in reading anything by either of these authors and if I'd not downloaded the story for free, I'd feel quite ripped off.",0
"""The Son of Man"" is a good read. I would call it Christian fiction.The storyline is an interesting one with many correlations to the actual biblical birth story of Jesus Christ. My only concern with this book is the pedophile priest. The priest could have been portrayed without this particular distraction and the book would not have suffered for it. It did not add anything that enhanced th story. I have no recollection of any pedophile priest in the time of the birth of Jesus.************SPOILER ALERT!**************I find it interesting how the asteroid is depicted as the guiding star at both birth instances. I would not have thought it would have been in the Earth's atmosphere for enough time to act as a guide, especially moving at 16,000 miles per hour.Still a good read and given the cloning aspects not exactly in the realm of science fiction.",1
My only complaint is that it is so short. I wanted to know more. The characters and descriptions are fantastic! The title perfectly captures the elements of the story (don't want to give spoilers). I want MORE of these characters&#8230;and I'm hoping the author will consider that.,1
"I was originally going to give this book only 4 stars becausegetting through the first few chapters was painfully difficult...I felt the whole Kerri begging Mitch to find her a husband was alittle stupid BUT.....Then everything changed....What a wonderfully fun,super sexy,emotionally packed story!!!!I just might start doing Yoga again  : )",1
Sorry to have wasted my eyeballs on this book/short story.  It was predictable and not even very well written. I would t recommend,0
"Co-themes of this book: continual same-sex rape and bondage along with describing the changing of a female human into a vampire like a dog in heat (including a heat scent) where constant sexual release would dull the pain. After reading a ""professional"" review on Amazon, I thought this book was going to be story-driven with sex on the side. Wrong. It was sex-driven, and not even well-written sex, with very little story on the side. I really should have known better. The narrator had a nasal quality that I found annoying.",0
"Although this is a short story, I did not manage to finish.Very dull and there no story line, in short there is a reason that they give the book for free.",0
Utter drivel. I guess the readers who are jesus freaks will like it but for the majority of the readers this is just tripe.,0
"Good book,couldn't put it down. Would recommend it to my friends. Can't wait for another book to read. Keep up the good work.",1
I loved loved loved this book. People have secret fantasies that they're afraid to admit to their significant others- afraid that they will be judged based off of those fantasies. The author brought everything that I fantasied about to life and I'm so glad she had the guts to go for it.,1
I did not like the way this item presented itself on the Kindle.  When I read a paper I look for things that interest me instead of reading the whole thing.  On the Kindle it was just to small to get the overall look at the stories.,0

Kate soon loses control of the car skidding off the road and Bobby and Cade instantly head to her rescue. What follows will surprise Kate and delight them all but will it be enough for these lone star cowboys to convince Kate to stay with them or will their winter tryst be just that.I really enjoyed Saddled, and if you love your cowboys you will too.",1
This was a very fast paced read and does not leave you bored but continuously wanting to find out what happenes next. I love the author's delver character. It is fresh and new and not something I have ever read and that is challenging considering It is my life hobby to read. I downloaded Part 2 and 3 and it did not dissapoint.,1
"I have had this book in my TBR pile for a while. I've heard many good things about the book and was looking forward to a good read when it finally reached the top of my list of books to read. Although it was an interesting premise and the writing was all right, I just couldn't stay with it for very long at a time. It lacked that spark that makes for a really good book. It seemed at times as though it was about to catch fire but would fizzle out again before the flame got going good. The best way I can describe how I feel about this book is that it was a 'dry' read for me. I'm glad I read it though. It is thought provoking and makes you wonder if something like this could really happen. Not that far fetched in today's world.",0
"Um...thought I'd read hot m&eacute;nage before, but excuse me for being mistaken. This really needed to be longer...... Much much longer. Yummy cowboys!",1
"I love books about rock stars, so when I found this I jumped on it. The joke was definitely on me. This story had the potential to be a great read, but I felt like I wasted my time. It read like it was rushed to completion. Some areas and characters were severly under developed and other areas gave way too much detail. I would love to see this rewritten and given a true chance to capture us rock star books loving praise.",0
I was expecting fantasy just not explicit sex. Check out all details about the book before purchasing. I was shocked right from the start. Not for the prim and proper,0
"I didn't read this quickly because the continual shifting from a short chapter about one character to the next short chapter about another worthless individual and then another, quite frankly was boring. I'm not sure why I persevered, but finally between 50% and the 60% point it suddenly began to pull me in. The last 40% of the book flew by. I really enjoyed that last 40%.",0

"Seriously a throwback to the old 1960's-70's Harlequin romances set in Europe. Obnoxious, autocratic male lead, weak thoughtless female who has every intention of standing up to Mr. Obnoxious but her big moments seem to fizzle. The more obnoxious he is towards her, the more she gets drawn in until she falls in love with the jerk. This is more like a case of Stockholm Syndrome. Please get this author a proof-reader and an editor before she publishes anything else!",0
"Cade has 16 facial piercings (Elliott counted) and is on recycling duty as part of community service for trashing his ex's car. Elliott is there for possessing stolen property (bought a stolen purse). They both grab an envelope with tickets for a concert and agree to meet after to decide who gets them. Elliott is the opposite of rude, pierced, tattooed Cade. He's 10 year's younger, a travel agent, ""nice boy"". Yet he's fascinated by Cade and when a few nights later Cade invites him to a concert he goes against his better judgment. Cade's piece of crap car breaks down after some weird concert and they are stuck in the mountains in the winter. They end up getting down in the back seat and after finally getting home kind of settle into seeing each other. Cade is Elliott's first (beyond BJ's) and things are going well until Cade runs into his ex at the concert they found the tickets for and he freaks and tries to give Elliott the brush off. Something I thought was interesting which is not usually touched on was that Cade's ex had been having unsafe sex and he'd been tested but had to wait until his 6 month test came back clean. I always understood that you needed that 6 month window but I know in most books once they get that first test that they are clean everything is bareback city. Anyway, I love me some tattooed pierced bad boys and the opposites attract thing. There's really not much to the plot, just the guys trying to form a relationships, Cade's insecurity at Elliott's youth and what that will mean. But when I want a comfort read it's a go-to for me.",1
"Who in the world thought this was good? I think maybe the authors close friends got on here n did some reviews or sad to say, readers who know nothing of good writing.  Nothing!!!! I wouldnt even want a friend to read this if i wrote it! N to say I was not looking for a mind blower here but some intense eroctica...well this was plain bad! Written in short sentences, like a primate or 3rd grader wrote it. Worst off I could of written this on an off day, fuled up on coffee, n little sleep.  Clearly writing isn't my day job so HELLO this sucked. If you are looking for some hot Alpha action this is not the book. Its honestly more embarrassing then anything...u like it here? No don't. Which way u like it. No please don't. How you do it....ugh! Really dude??? Anywho...if its free check it out but not even one buck is worth it.",0
"I bought this because I had enjoyed one of the author's other books.  Unfortunately, this did not live up to the other.  The description was more interesting than the actual story.  The leading male and female were so boring I kept waiting for the story to start.  There was no chemistry between them or even with any other characters.  The dialogue was stilted and cheesy.  I couldn't wait to delete it from my Kindle.",0
"Did you ever jump into the middle of a movie and try to figure out who's who and what's what?Well of course you have.If you like that feeling and you're a sci-fi fan, well this is the short story for you.Calling it a Star Wars story is a stretch because except for the words ""Sith"", ""the force"" and ""light saber"" there is absolutely no connection to the Star Wars movies or the books (that I have read - I haven't read them all but I've read a scattered few).  This is just a standard sci-fi story about an unhappy crew that crash lands on an unexplored planet. It is intended to be part of a series of prequels for another book (Star Wars: Fate of the Jedi: Omen). A sample of that book is also included with this short story.I paid nothing for the story so I'm not out anything - just the time I spent wondering what the heck was going on and also wondering why I didn't care if these creatures survived or not.I will not be reading #2 or #3 in this series - I had downloaded them but quickly deleted them once I finished #1. Too many better things to read out there to waste my time with this.",0

"Where do I begin? A quick overview. Basically, the USA is sick of divorces. The government was embarrassed so if you want to get married you need to fill out a questionnaire from the government and they'll pick your match. Rainy, does just that. She's at a point in her life where she's graduated, has a decent job, now she just wants someone to share her time with. Her father is a State Representative so in order to not embarrass him she fills out the questionnaire. Ashely Schroeder, the heir to a major appliance corporation does just the same and is paired with Rainy. You can probably figure out it doesn't go exactly as planned.I'll try to keep spoilers out of this but it may be difficult. I'd like to warn you that I'm about to throw a little spoiler out. Rainy, accuses Ashley of being an alcoholic and yet, hello? Maybe she should take a good look at herself! She got wasted the first night she met Ashley and his family. Talk about the pot calling the kettle? Also, why would she file an appeal without speaking to Ashley. When she finds out he's already filed for one she goes ballistic. So it's ok for her but not him? Then she proceeds to ignore him and all of his calls and correspondence for two months. Pot and kettle, my friend.I'm not sure I enjoyed this. I thought it was a bit too drawn out. I thought Rainy was a bit rude in some situations. When her and Ashley met for counseling she was terrible to him. I was cringing. Ok, obviously, their match wasn't perfect but she signed up for it the same as him. It's kind of a 50/50. Yeah his mom was terrible, yeah they didn't exactly have the same views on what a marriage was all about, yeah the government got it wrong but at least Ashley tried to suck it up and tried to be nice to her.I think that this could have been a little better. I feel there were some things that were just thrown in for length. Like when she was putting around her museum. We pretty much could have skipped most of that. I didn't hate this book, but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone either.  It had a lot of good ideas but I also felt a lot of contradictions as well. Especially, with Rainy's family. I don't mean to be so negative but I wasn't excited by the end of this one.",0
"I readThe Naughty Little Tower Room: Erotic Romance Fantasyand was looking for another great, sexy romance novel when I stumbled across this book. This was definitely what I was looking for. ""Bonded by Need tells the sexy, erotic story of a trio of characters who simply can't keep their hands off each other. At least the men can't seem to keep their hands off Jayda. Jayda is a polymorphic shifter, which means she can transform from a human to a wolf or a cougar. She's recently moved to a new town and is now meant to marry the head of the wolf council.Jayda and the wolf council leader Cole are bonded together and destined to be married. The wolf part of Jayda is happy for the connection and Jayda hopes that all of her can be satisfied by the relationship with Cole. But her cougar side is crying out for someone else. That someone else just happens to be the head of the cougar council, Zane. Both men are obsessed with Jayda and can't seem to stay away but can either one actually satisfy her completely?Cole wants to be life mates with Jayda and believes that he is the only one for her. But Zane can't resist the seduction Jayda employs to try and get him for herself. Jayda wants both of the men but can she really have them both? Everything is starting to change as more and more people are killed and Jayda will need to make a choice before someone else ruins everything for good. But can she really choose between the two different sides of herself? And can she choose between the two men who both promise to satisfy her so well?This book is a great story about how one woman can be torn in more than one direction. I think Jayda is a character that nearly any woman could relate to since she seems like she's in a struggle between herself to choose which mate will be the best for her. This is a lot like just about any woman who is trying to make a choice that could prove to be incredibly important to her as time goes on. The two male characters are each hot and amazing in their own right and you'll be rooting for each of them by turns as they show their true colors and their true feelings for Jayda.This book is a great story about romance and love as well as involving some supernatural elements in the form of the shape shifters and the things they have to face in order to make their way through life. If they don't make some decisions quickly, decisions will be made for them and the results may not be good at all.",1
"Lady Catherine and Baron Borgeault have been married for seven years.The Baron is a pig and the marriage is not a happy one. He has a pair of horses he wants to sell. He invites Adam Stanford Earl of Ashworth to visit his home with a view to selling the Earl the horses. This is where the Earl first lays eyes on the Baron's very beautiful wife Catherine.This is a romance but it is far from romantic IMO. Although initially we are lead to dislike Baron Borgeault, I very soon came to pity him, he was a poor tormented soul, and although he treated his wife poorly, she for her part had never once in seven years of their marriage made any attempt to pierce his defences and try to discover how to help him. I found her weak and vain, with no backbone. My own personal objection to this story is that it is based on adultery, not my favourite theme for a story. At the time I downloaded this it was free, I assume that this is to persuade the reader to purchase further books in this series. Was I persuaded no afraid not.",0
I found the first book for free and couldn't get enough so I went and bought  all the rest of the books love them I will be reading a lot more of her books just could not put them down a must read,1
"I thought I had read all oh Maggie Shayne's books, but I was wrong. These were all good and very entertaining. I recommend this very highly.",1
A really good book. Definitely a book to read again later. Definitely the type to get and keep my attention.,1
"Most of the reviews have a lot of the plot points that I would mention so I'll just say that I like this book, it kept me thoroughly entertained and everything flows nicely. Devlin mentions military service then switches branches. That kind of threw me but other than that a lot of the things were right on. I like how she makes The men's actions something that is liekely to happen in real life where one is obviosly more gung ho about the M/M than the other one but because they both want her they do what she wants. I enjoyed this book and will be looking for Devlin's other work today!",1
"""The sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful existence.""Professor Pierre Arronax and his assistant, Conseil, join the crew of the Abraham Lincoln to chase down this strange ocean mammal that has been destroying ships. The duo, along with harpooner Ned Land, end up overboard and rescued by what is revealed to be a submarine, not a mammal. This submarine is captained by Nemo, a mysterious man who has eschewed the land in preference to roaming the open seas. Nemo takes the trio twenty thousand leagues across the seas - from the Pacific to the Indian to the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Along the way, Arronax uncovers bits and pieces about his captain and catalogs the various fish he sees.Jules Verne is basically the Father of Science Fiction. His novels - such as ""Twenty Thousand Leagues"" - were groundbreaking for their time. I'd go so far to say that if it weren't for him, we wouldn't have the science fiction genre at all.That said, this book was supremely dry and dull most of the time. Yes, it is ""hard science fiction"" with lots of attention to detail to the mechanics of underwater ""sailing"" (some of which is incredibly on the mark; others, such as the lamp lighting the way of the Nautilus, laughable and out-dated), but there comes a point when enough is enough. This is particularly prevalent when Arronax/Verne spends multiple pages describing the flora and fauna of the sea in intricate detail (""cataloging fish"" into their species and genus) or having long conversations with other characters about irrelevant history (such as the electric cable stretching from the Americas to Ireland).Again, I greatly appreciate the attention to detail and the thought Verne put into the operation of the Nautilus. That isn't my problem. And I don't mind some detail about the sights Arronax sees while traveling. But the latter in particular ""sinks"" the story. And when the story is as diluted and sparse as it is here, that is nearly a death warrant.The majority of this novel reads as a travelogue, Google Maps directions, an account of someone's rather dull vacation. While there are a few scenes that are particularly interesting (the journey to the Antarctic and nearly being trapped underwater, a way too short squid attack, and some walking underwater scenes), by far most of the book is cataloging fish or boring ""and on Mar 21st, we sailed from X in Y direction to Z"". Yawn. What makes this is even more ridiculous is that Arronax, Ned Land, and Conseil are supposedly held prisoner aboard the Nautilus, so they do not leave and divulge its secrets elsewhere, but no one seems to care about being held against their will until suddenly they are. I'd say ""Stockholm Syndrome"", only they give a half-hearted struggle when Captain Nemo tells them they are stuck on the ship. Based on how it is written and how little concern these characters have to their captivity, I don't know why Verne didn't just have Captain Nemo invite Arronax to journey with him and maybe decide that he didn't WANT them to leave.The only (and by far the best) character in this book is Captain Nemo. Sure, there is Arronax, Conseil, and Ned Land, but calling them ""characters"" is a stretch, unless you are using the most generous of definitions of ""character"". Arronax is probably the best of the trio. He has some moments of humor (as a side note, there is quite a bit of humor, and it is well applied and a good break from the blandness of most of the text) and has a complicated relationship with Nemo. Ned Land would be next. His sole character trait is wanting to kill anything that moves - whales, kangaroo, tigers, you name it. Pretty much any time he appears in the story, it's to talk about wanting to kill something or escape (and honestly, he doesn't even CONSIDER escape until the last 75% of the novel). The absolute worst character, in my opinion, is Conseil. The guy makes Saltine Crackers look like they aren't bland. If you want a cold, blindly loyal servant, this is your man.But I hesitate to blame this lack of characterization on Verne's skill as an author or the standard ""But it's hard scifi, not a character study!"", particularly when you have the complex character of Captain Nemo. What the other characters aren't, Captain Nemo is. Apparently, something bad happened to his wife and his children - something bad enough to make him abandon the land all together and sail in his boat, enacting revenge on passing ships. But he isn't a cold blooded killer - he stays Ned Land's hand, when Ned wants to harpoon a bunch of whales for the hell of it. (Of course, not more than a couple of paragraphs later, Nemo then slaughters a bunch of ""sperm whales"", so calling the guy a hypocrite is definitely in order.)So the story is meh, the characters are meh, and the descriptions are overboard. Part of that is just me not really being that hot on the book (my dad, a retired Navy submariner, and my sister both ADORE this book and think I am mad for not). That's only a small part of ""Twenty Thousand Leagues"". The more important part - and the reason I think that any fan of scifi should read this book - is its influence on the genre. This is the great-great-great-great grandfather of novels like ""Ender's Game"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". So in that regard, this book is priceless - it gives me a better respect for the genre I love.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",0
"Shifter romance.  Great book.  Very entertaining with good humour, strong plot and characters.  Lays a great foundation for the rest of the series.  Worth reading and having a good laugh while enjoying the interaction between characters.",1
"I liked the chemistry between the two main characters, but that was about all I liked. I feel like there should have been more character development because although I was attached to Josephine, I was not to Blake so I was not really excited about the ending.",0
I liked the book because it finished off a couple of character stories which is always good...but it felt like it had been written quickly and it was a little short......but it is good to have an end so thank gena for that....,0
Holly has been single since her divorce but has decided it's about time she got out there and started dating again. After signing up for a dating agency she has spent weeks talking to Kent over the phone and by email and it's finally time for them to meet for the first time. Before she can spend the afternoon hopefully getting horizontal with Kent Holly needs to get through a business lunch with her much younger colleague Alex. The longer she spends chatting to Alex the more the sparks fly between them but will she ditch her date with a stranger and take things further with Alex instead?Holly a sexy and confident older woman who is looking for a bit of no strings fun with a younger guy with stamina. Just out of a messy divorce Holly isn't looking for anything serious but is in need of some genuine passion in her life. Alex has been crushing on Holly since he started working at the same law firm as her. He also secretly owns an online dating agency and when he sees that Holly has registered he can't resist temptation and contacts her pretending to be a guy called Kent. The more time he has spent chatting with her the more he knows that he wants something serious but he doesn't know how to tell her that he has been using a false identity. What will happen when Holly realises the truth?Full Disclosure is a fun and sexy story and makes for a great read. I really enjoyed getting to know both Holly and Alex and their relationship is definitely a steamy one. Alex is one hot guy and I loved the way he was so determined to break down Holly's reservations about dating a younger man. The age difference is never an issue for him and he respects Holly for her brains as well as her beauty. If you're looking for a fast and spicy read then I'd definitely recommend picking this one up.,0
"PLOT: Hospital cafeteria worker Zandrea first bumps into Brant in the ER. He's injured and bleeding but he leaves without receiving treatment. She sees him soon after at a club and his injuries are healed. Brant overhears her discussing him with her friends. He approaches her with the intentions of having his brother erase her memories of him. But something about her calls to his nature and the evening does not go exactly as he planned. He knows that he cannot be without her.PROS: The author weaves a good plot. The love scenes between Zan and Brant are hot.CONS: The character development could be better. We know very little about Zan and Brant. Zan came off as only being immature. When she met Brant, she was hanging out in the ER for a chance to meet a doctor. That's just wrong.Much of the middle of the book they spend separated since Zan has forgotten him. So at the end when they get their ""happy ever after,"" it's not so believable that she loves him and vice versa.It's a minor issue but it speaks to the plausibility of the plot; Zan never actually see's Brant's injury. She sees blood seeping through his shirt. Since she doesn't know how serious his injury was, there's no reason for her to question it and no reason for him to go after her.3 STARS: I gave it three stars since it is an interesting start to a series. It has peaked my interest enough that I'd like to finish the trilogy.",0
"I pretty much enjoyed this story.  They met on an orgy cruise, had sex without knowing how the other looked, and was hooked.  Surprisingly this story was well developed with the characters.  Kind of got tired of the female always bringing up her weight, though.  It was refreshing when he didn't want a 'relationship' with her and had the nerve to be upset when she didn't want one with 'him'...she wanted more and walked.  Some may not like the way she became conniving and went out of her way to make Troy jealous, but in the real world men do need us to show them the way, so they can be happy. (LOL) I would recommend you read with your partner nearby.",1
"Note: This review was originally published on Red Adept Reviews on March 8, 2011.Overall:  3 starsPlot/Storyline:  3 starsChristina was like a junior Wonder Woman - she skydived, scuba dived, and flew airplanes like an experienced pilot after only a few hours of instruction. If the girls were a little younger, and if the more violent scenes were rewritten or deleted, the story would be appropriate - perhaps even inspirational - for younger teenagers, but the story just wasn't believable enough for me.The first third of the book, which followed the three girls from age eleven through high school, wasn't that interesting and served little purpose. There were dead ends such as the chapter where Jessica's abusive stepfather Roy beat her mom senseless, broke down Jessica's bedroom door, and tried to rape her. Jessica had telephoned Christina to help her, so Christina rushed over and stopped Roy by threatening him with her shotgun. But there was no follow-up, no calling the police, no mention of the stepfather after that. And there was very little mention of any of the girls' parents, it's almost as if they raised themselves.About halfway through the story, the action picked up and the story got more interesting when the three girls entered college. Christina started flying lessons, Heather became romantically involved with an older man, and Jessica studied old Spanish archives to locate sunken treasure. The three girls were now living their dreams. During a summer break, they embarked on a trip to the Bahamas on a treasure-hunting expedition that ended in tragedy. And this is where it really got too unbelievable for me. Christina showed flying skills that only a veteran pilot would have, even though she had not even earned her pilot's license. Her instructor had told her that she was the best student he had ever taught, but it was too much of a reach to believe she could fly planes as expertly as she did in the story.The story had too many convenient coincidences (such as an uncharted island being right where you need it) and implausible events (such as Jessica pinpointing sunken Spanish treasure that had eluded professional treasure hunters for years).I do have to say that the scene where Christina sought revenge on the culprit responsible for the Bahamas disaster was quite satisfying, even if it was a bit improbable.Characters:  4 starsChristina, Heather, and Jessica were the main characters, and the author did a good job of developing them as flesh and blood people, even if their emotions didn't always seem realistic to me.Writing style:  3 starsThe author's writing style was generally good, but the emotions and the dialogues of the story's characters were not very realistic at times. After witnessing the sudden, violent death of a close friend or relative, most people would be devastated and in shock. These characters, however, got over tragedies quickly and moved on.If you're going to have your characters engage in specialized activities, an author should be familiar with those activities. There were some glaring errors in this regard. For example, while skydiving for the first time, Christina ""pulled the ripcord and tossed it to the side."" I've skydived, and you don't toss the ripcord away, for two reasons: (1) it could kill someone on the ground, and (2) ripcords are not cheap to replace. She also pulled the ripcord at 1,000 feet, which is well below the minimum altitude for opening your parachute. Trust me, you get yelled at for things like that and get banned from a drop zone.Later, when Christina was taking flying lessons, she goes up with her instructor in a ""Citborea,"" an aerobatic aircraft. I think the author meant a Citabria.Editing:  2 starsThe book was in serious need of editing and proofreading. I found quite a few grammatical and punctuation errors, and misspellings were found every few pages. A few examples: ""ought"" for ""aught,"" ""ware"" for ""were,"" ""ya'll"" for ""y'all,"" ""brake"" for ""break,"" ""waist"" for ""waste,"" ""metamorphous"" for ""metamorphosis,"" ""depravation"" for ""deprivation,"" ""choral reef"" for ""coral reef,"" and so on.",0
"You know, I hardly EVER give a book one star. But this book...*sigh* where do I start?First off, I'm not against light reads. I read my share of them and most of the time find them enjoyable. But there's light and there's light. This is dandelion fluff light. So light that the plot seems to have blown away into thin air.M. L. McClure has her share of devotees but I should have listened more closely to the reviews. Very few comment on the plot. It's just ""all about the kissing"". And folks, seriously, it is. I mean, there's little else. It's like the author draws two characters(so they can kiss) Oh no! Make it four; (you know, more to kiss); there. Ok, now where can they kiss? Lets see...how about a prairie kiss? Then lets go to the river and have a river kiss? Hey, meet me by the barn and we'll kiss again! And have you seen the tree house? Well, let me SHOW you! *kiss kiss*. It was THE WHOLE STORY!!! And each kiss (and lead up) may be two or three PAGES!.Hey, I like romance as much as the next person but give us a REASON TO CARE.And it was so Disney. Enter poor clumsy heroine and hero hunk. Hero hunk loves poor clumsy heroine over all others (though he can have his pick) for no reason other than she's adorable and  he's older and wiser (and can teach her to kiss). He rescues her non stop through every scrape. She falls in a mud puddle. Guess who's there to pull her out? Enter abusive Daddy, Prairie Prince to the rescue!She's being chased by murderers, have no fear, Prairie Prince is here (on his stallion no less).*SPOILER*  They kissed.The one redeeming feature of this book is it's short. And free.Still, I can't believe I read the WHOLE thing...",0

"Plot/Storyline: 4 3/4 StarsThe clever crafting of these storylines shows an unbound imagination combined with high intelligence on the part of Mr. Tuttle. Each of the stories has a unique plot with interesting resolutions.My favorite was the first one. Having it first in the collection was a great idea as I think it did the best job of introducing the two main characters and how they played off of each other.The central theme throughout all three is basically ""Use brains, not brawn."" The author sticks to that concept in interesting ways.The sense of humor I have come to expect from Mr. Tuttle is present in each story making for a very fun read.I would have liked a little more background to better understand the vow taken by Wistril, how it was enforced, etc.Character Development: 4 StarsThere was a ""Forward"" included that introduced Wistril and his apprentice, Kern. While helpful, I have always felt that stories should speak for themselves.I didn't expect as much character development in the first two shorter works. The third one was much longer and should have given us more insight, especially into Wistril's motivations.Writing Style: 5 StarsMr. Tuttle's writing style is an absolute joy to read. His humor and vocabulary, which includes some words that won't be found in Webster's, make his work shine.Editing/Formatting: 4 1/2 StarsThere were a few editing errors, but not so numerous as to spoil the mood. The formatting was good except for a couple of line breaks in odd places.Rating: G for everyone",1
"It's not the worst book I've ever read, but very disappointed by the author Joshua Guess. The e-mail/blog writing was so pedestrian that even during The Zombie Apocalypse, I'd have deleted it. Need supplies to survive? Go to Lowe's, Costco, survivalist supply store, and of course get solar and wind power stuff. Btw, make sure you have been taking all those martial arts classes since you were a kid.P.S. play lots of video games about zombies so you can recognize the outbreak before all your neighbors do and hog all the supplies you are going to need. Also, cell phones and the Internet will be working so that you can contact all your friends and tell everyone else, in advance, where you'll be so they can they can trap and rob you. Because as we all know, everyone using the Internet is completely trustworthy and would never, ever try to dupe or harm you. Really? No inconsistencies here!!I have just saved you the time and money you would have spent reading this. I really liked Joshua Guess' Victim Zero, so felt blindsided by the lack of character depth or any real sense of tension in this blog driven story.

"Although legally an adult, Millicent Anderson is still under her father's domineering thumb.

As fate would have it, Johnny Pickett is also exactly the kind of guy her father would never let her be friends with, much less date.Will Millie defy her family and find true love in the arms of bad boy Johnny?YOU SEND ME is a short story prequel to Toni Blake's full-length novel, LETTERS TO A SECRET LOVER.  In LETTERS TO A SECRET LOVER, the heroine moves to Moose Falls to learn more about her late Aunt Millie, and perhaps continue her legacy in the small town that so revered her. In YOU SEND ME, we travel back in time to the summer when a young Millie first visited Moose Falls, and learn just why the town meant so much to her for the rest of her days.Although a novella, YOU SEND ME is no less poignant for the brief length.  The romance between Millie and Johnny moves along rapidly, but logically.  We feel the magic between these lovers that binds them more surely in a few weeks than years together could ever do.Both Johnny and Millie help each other grow during their courtship.  Still haunted by the ravages of the war he fought in, Johnny finds a comfort in Millie that heals his wounded soul.  In turn, Johnny fosters courage in Millie to stand up to her father and grab her dreams.YOU SEND ME is a wonderful little tryst - short and sweet, but with a definite moral to the story and a lot of romance!Connected Books:Letters to a Secret Lover (Avon Romance)",1

"Psycops is one of my favorite urban fantasies and Secrets is my favorite in the series thus far. Jordan Castillo Price has created a fun world, with interesting mysteries and with funny (yes, here is that word again) and sexy characters. Despite being urban fantasy, the characters and the setting are written in very a realistic manner and despite having a romance storyline throughout the books and the series, the romance does not overwhelm the storyline.The setting is Chicago and unlike another of my favorite urban fantasy authors that sets his books in Chicago, Jordan Castillo Price gets Chicago right. Throughout the Psycops series there are 4 key characters. Vic is the main character who is police officer. He is extremely insecure, socially awkward, completely jealous of his boyfriend's former lover yet still very endearing. Vic has an absent partner, Lisa - a very funny and loving person. Then we have Jacob, Vic's serious boyfriend and Jacob's partner Carolyn. Now comes the urban fantasy part of the series - Vic, Lisa and Carolyn each possess different psychic skills and as a result, are employed by police departments to assist in solving crimes. Jacob is not psychically talented but he is very much interested in people who are. Much of the series centers on Vic dealing with his ""talent"", which is seeing and communicating with ghosts, using his talent to solve a crime and the interplay of Vic's relationship with Jacob.The strength of the series to me is the incredibly complex characters Ms. Price writes, along with witty humor. When I am reading any one book in this series I am literally laughing out loud and marking excerpt after excerpt. I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves urban fantasy, mysteries or just self-effacing humor. Below are some excerpts from Secrets I particularly liked:(Vic commenting on the new home that he and his boyfriend moved in to and of which he spent the recent few days attempting to organize - unsuccessfully): ""When I got home from work, the cannery looked like an actual dwelling instead of a warehouse that'd been organized by a nearsighted drunk.""""A flicker of actual interest registered in the receptionist's eyes.  `Third floor, Detective.'  And if she noticed that Lisa was dressed in a mishmash of men's sweats, she didn't so much as blink over it.""""the longer I sat there, the closer I was to trying another sip of that decaf coffee.  I stood up and wondered if I was supposed to walk around and pull Lisa's chair out for her, but she was on her feet and bussing her own tray before I even had my own chair pushed in.""""I looked at Jacob.  He was watching me.  Still smiling.  I did my best to telepathically scream, `What the hell?' I don't think he received it.""""How could he do this to us? To me.  To either of us.  We were all in on it, all four of us.  Lisa might survive women's prison if she joined a Mexican gang.  Carolyn wou8ld probably be a smear on the wall within the first week.  I could squeak by if I was still good at being invisible.  But Jacob would be a big trophy kill, shanked by some tough guy looking to prove himself, probably beaten and tortured first.  Jesus Christ.""""We walked more slowly carrying our steaming hot cups of coffee with their helpful warnings printed on the side.""Warning:  The book contains explicit m/m sexual scenes.",1

"Nicole Zoltack's WOMAN OF HONOR weaves the tale of the first lady knight of Arnhem. Sprinkled with historical facts, bullies, and a good dose of love and honor, WOMAN OF HONOR is a coming of age novel set in the fantastical medieval world of Arnhem Kingdom. Aislinn is brave and truly grows to be a woman of honor. The characters are likeable and realistic. We feel Aislinn's pains while she tries to prove herself. She overcomes tradition and the growing threat of Speica. This novel has history, knights, and mythological creatures and is filled with intrigue, mystery, horror, and, most important of all, love.

"Ctales Publishing should hire me as an editor.  My qualifications?  Let's count them:1.  I understand the proper use of commas, colons, semi-colons and periods.2.  I understand that, when conversing with each other, people do not say ""I am"" or ""it is"".  They say ""I'm"" and ""it's"".  This is especially true in high stress situations.3.  When writing, I know to identify the subjects of a scene with a break in text or a completely new chapter.  The writer tended to shift to new scenes by starting new paragraphs with zero indications that the scene was shifting.4.  I can frigging spell!!!!  More specifically, while using any decent word processing software, I recognize the significance of the red, squiggly lines under words.5.  Notice, there are zero run-on sentences in my review.I truly enjoy post-apocalypse-world stories however, if this is what passes for acceptable writing, I weep for our literary future.As for the characters, Dora, Tim and Mary would not survive more than a week in my zombie bunker.

"Updated from March 12, 2012 to fix typos in review.Let me start this review with a brief synopsis of the plot as that is lacking in the description.The heroine, Catherine is in a miserable marriage.  She is married to a baron who, based on the storytelling appears to be somewhat mentally abusive.  Her husband is an alcoholic and appears to have some emotional issues.  She is considered the most beautiful woman of her time and her husband likes to dress her as a strumpet when he has the occasional gentleman over.  The hero, Adam is an Earl who is ""lured"" to the castle for a pair of twin horses.  He meets Catherine and based on her looks, falls instantly in love with her.  The question to be answered is how can Catherine and Adam be together given that she is married?  Is it worth scandal for their love to blossom?As I read this book, I find several things incredulous.  First, this ""love"" between Catherine and Adam isn't really that well developed.  I can believe she loves him as she was forced into this marriage at 17 and has been secluded since that time, and Adam does not stare at her breasts that are so amply displayed by her husband.  He is kind and loving to her and teaches her about passion.  However, based on what was told in this story, I am at a loss regarding Adam's love.  Everything that is described sounds like the lust of a tremendously beautiful woman (think, Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, etc.).  I don't see how they had enough non-physical interaction for him to fall in love with more than her face and figure.The author shows Catherine as a sweet and compassionate person despite the lack of such she has received from her husband, but never directly to Adam.  Additionally, there was a scene where the men who were hoping to gain Catherine's favors (she never presented herself as a woman who would grant any) crashed another soiree when they learned that was where she was headed next.  I found this to be absurd.The villain of the story, Catherine's husband Edgar did not seem much of a villain once his story was told.  I would have liked to see more of his story early rather than later in the novel and if done right, perhaps I could have excused the adultery.Overall, I can't really recommend this novel unless someone doesn't care about infidelity.  I found this novel to be weak, the adultery aside and did not care enough about the hero and heroine.  Yes, I finished it because frankly, I wanted to know more about the husband and, was curious to know how the author would get us to the happy ending that is expected in these types of novels.  Despite the novel progressing to the point where Catherine and Adam could be together, the ending left a lot to be desired as well.  I will not be purchasing any additional novels by this author.",0
"I live in N. California. My son went to Humboldt University..a spit away from Eureka.If you haven't been up here, you might not know that kids come up here to go to college, first time away from home, and start wearing tie dye, woven shorts and birkenstocks. Within a week, they are stumping for the legalization of Hemp.They mean cannabis, of course, but they say hemp. 4 years later, with an education they head for Silicon Valley for the big tech money..and have forgotten about Hemp.This wonderful book takes a look at the rapidly changing technology (Gizmos) and of course Nile.com...and extrapolates the end of Dead Tree Books, therefore the end of bookstores.An 'out of it' couple go to Eureka to claim a bookstore the husband's Uncle Sy left him in a hard to find will.  This couple may as well have lived on the moon..they have missed the eccentricity of San Francisco which is not far from where they were living. Protected by their condo walls and high end jobs, they have no idea of any other way of life.I won't give away the plot.  If you don't know that marijuana is California's largest cash crop, and Humboldt county the largest growing area, and that getting a medical card here to buy legally grown pot takes 5 minutes, you may not 'get' this book.  Every now and then our very own state leaders try to decide if marijuana should be legalized to pay off the state debt.  So far, it hasn't happened.The couple learns that the falling apart bookstore is making a million plus $ a year, and give up plans to go back to their feathered nest in San Jose.  Greedy?  Well who wouldn't be?  They begin living out of the cash register and never see what is really going on.The rest of the story is in the book.Don't let your sensibilities decide..OMG this is about POT! and not read it..this is one great book.It is about so much more.It is funny and semi-true and there are some delicious lines in the book that I wish I had thought of saying.I will keep this book in my Kindle (irony again) and re-read it.GREAT BOOK!!!!!",1
I love books that are actually unpredictable. You think you know how this story is gonna unfold??? Read it. lol,1
"I HAVE NEVER LEFT A BOOK UNFINISHED, UNTIL NOW. I KNEW IT WAS FULL OF SHORT STORIES, BUT I DID NOT KNOW NONE OF THE STORIES HAD ANY KIND OF ENDING. THEY JUST DROP OFF AND LEAVE YOU HANGING. I READ LESS THAN A THIRD OF THIS BOOK BEFORE I DECIDED I'DE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE. SHORT STORIES CAN HAVE FINAL ENDINGS. I'VE READ SEVERAL SHORT STORIES BEFORE AND THEY HAD ENDINGS, ENDINGS CAN BE WORKED INTO SMALL STORIES. IN FACT IT'S REALLY NICE WHEN A STORY LETS YOU KNOW THE END RESULTS.  WHAT ARE READERS SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THESE STORIES, MAKE UP THEIR OWN CLOSURE? I WILL NEVER FINISH THE BOOK BECAUSE THE STORIES ARE NOT COMPLETE. I PURCHASED A BOOK BEFORE THAT CONSISTED OF 45 PAGES WITH AN ENDING. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU WANT TO INVENT YOUR OWN STORY ENDINGS.",0
It has been a while but from what I can recall it was a great read. Nice story line and I would be willing to share with anyone interested in this type of book.,1
This has by far got to be one of the most depressing books I've ever read in my entire life. I used to read those Lurlene McDaniel books where the kids have terminal illnesses and this was worse. The ONLY reason I didn't give it one star is because it is well edited and had no glaring plot issues despite being worse than The Notebook on crack.,0
"Up until the point where the author wrote that the Pope Pius XII and the Catholic Church did nothing to help the Jews, the story was engrossing. However, the author didn't do his research well or he would have learned the truth. The black legend that said that the Pope did nothing to help the Jews may be the 20th century's most enduring lie. Historical documents prove that he did whatever he could to save them. His dilemma was how does he speak out without further endangering the Jews. He went to the edge of risk and he saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish people. Many he kept hidden in the Vatican and others were hidden in convents and monasteries. Hundreds of priests went to the death camps for speaking out against Hitler.I, a Jewish woman, gave this book one star because of this major flaw.",0
"I enjoyed this book so much!  Loved the main hero Hannibal Jones!  What an Alpha Male Hero!  I was so busy turning the pages that my poor husband had to do all the chores!  The suspense never let's up!  The action is well planned!  It is a taut, fast pace action thriller with just enough of romance interweaved!  I loved the fact that that the author, Mr Camacho, made Hannibal a very human hero, who wins a few and loses a few!  For fans of Action Thrillers this is a book well worth reading!  I am definitely a FAN!",1
This was a really fun read! I loved the writing style. All the characters had personality and were exciting to read about! I loved the little twist at the end :) Great story!,1
"I couldn't figure out the plot, I am sorry to say.  If you work in the field of production, or the writing of script for TV shows, you might be interested but I was just lost all the way through the book. I can't even really explain it, as my mind would wander while reading it.  I finally gave up, as I have a lot of other books on my Kindle to read that are, hopefully, better.",0
A lovely set of books that keep you interested by jumping from one character to another. You have to keep reading to find out what's going to happen.,1
These mysteries are mundane examples of how a person can slowly gather enough data to discover what happened to the subject of the mystery,0
"If you like your women hard and your men harder this is a steamy romp with just enough familial devotion and revenge to tie a plot around some explicit sexual, and perhaps romantic, content.  Something to have fun with, but don't expect great literature.",0
"Of all the tropes in paranormal romance, the whole ""werecreature sees beautiful woman and realizes she is his fated mate"" is one of the dullest and played out.  Of course, that is the point of this story (which is pointlessly split into a trilogy).Donovan is a werecat.  He sees Isabella, a witch, in peril.  He realizes that she is his mate (it doesn't hurt that she's gorgeous), saves her life, and then they do it.  Oh, and there is a powerful magic book and some mean werewolves.  The plot truly demonstrates that it was the last priority of the author, thrown in because she needed something to get her oh-so-sexy main characters in the same room.Is it too much to ask that people actually fall in love in paranormals anymore?  Or even fall in old-fashioned lust that doesn't involve realizing your soul is tied to another for eternity?",0
"A contemporary erotica novella, ""Annabelle Lee"" follows Annabelle, an ultra-conservative librarian and Mike, blue collar worker who owns his own construction company.In the small town of Summersville, it is hard to hide any type of budding romance. But Annabelle and Mike did simply because everything they shared for six months were erotic fantasies. That is, until the air conditioning in the library broke down and Mike had to fix it. But, while the temperature in the house of tomes cools down, Annabelle and Mike got hotter as they became face to face with the subject of their erotic dreams.Told from the points of view of Annabelle and Mike, the erotic scenes were obviously related from the points of view of a man and a woman, which made it quite interesting because the author changed POV during the act.Definitely Rated M for Mature but there is also tenderness and love. The main protagonists are lovable and the townspeople are just so adorable.",1
I had a few chuckles here and there in the book. Kind of does remind me of how dad's are everyday.,1
am going to help the Beginners out on this one. You can get the first one for ANYWHERE from zero to 99cents. or Save even bigger dough and buy them in groups of threes1-3 4-6 7-9 get those groups and save big.Hey if you even half way think you like the sample. Then fork out the bucks and save. So many have that it seems to be the only way to fly. Unless you have a Peacekeeper car. I want one I want one Heck I just want a stack of metal and I will build my own magic flying carpet ride.Ricky has to have been born and raised in the south. That is why we have a hero with the name of Jim Bob. No his name is not Jim Bob. It is just JIM.Still it give you a pause.On a personal basis I loved each and every one of the books in this 9 part series the action was always on the beat and the typos or mistakes were very minimal Yes I did find a few things like reading about the mans piers instead of the mans peers meaning his contemporaries. Still that does not take away from the whole experience of the reading of these great group of books. I loved them loved them loved them. It takes you from the days leading up to the Apocalypses and then to the years trying to bring about a recovery. There are starts and stops and false starts and stops Let us hope that it could be such a great help from technology.All in all you miss this series and you loose a great read and some thought provoking ideas.dray,1
Albert Simon held my attention in each of his books I have read.  You feel like you know the people he creates.,1
This book was such a struggle for me to read. I was annoyed and bored for awhile. Then I just gave up and did not finish it. This book was not my cup of tea.,0
Really?  I had settled in for a nice long read and was sadly disappointed!!!!!!!!  Wow .....what a waste of time.,0
"The series gets old fast and there is too much dialog. The editing of the book is poor with misspelled words, incorrect technical terms used for velocity and distance and use of wrong words.No one ever dies they can be 75% blown away and be recreated by nano technology. It starts getting too farfetched for my tastes.",0
"This story was unrealistic and didn't really keep me wanting to read more. The sex scenes were a little too graphic for my taste and the overall story was just not believable. Thank goodness it was FREE, otherwise I'd have been pissed to have paid money to read this.",0
"Sex...Furry ears...sex.....Kidnap 1000  women,,,chase them down...furry ears sexI couldn't finish the book. I picked up the above info. I got it for free I shouldn't complain",0
"The ending had me confused I got tired of the guy talking and the sex scenes were okay...I see what people was talking about. The story was choppy and there wasn't no history behind the characters,only thing they talk about was the emerald..But besides that it was okay...it was a good read to pass time.",0
"This was a nice mystery to settle down with and read.  It did a good job of drawing me into the story.  I liked the setting, although I know nothing about Maine, and the characters were very likable.  I plan to read the next in the series, 'Murder in the Choir Room'.",1
"I should read the title eh?  I thought it was his works, but it was just the TOC and Index.  That'll teach me to pay more attention next time, eh?",0
"This book was good. I would've liked more history on the ""magic"". It was mentioned frequently towards the end of the story, but really vague. For that, I gave it 2 stars. I wanted to know about the relationship of the lead female and her parents. Again, they're mentioned, but that's it. This book has a good foundation but seriously lacks in the character development area. The chemistry between the lead characters is believable, but there's just not that much there. Good free read, glad I didn't pay good money for it.",0
Quick read. Wish there was a bit more to the story and characters. Definitely steamy. Hot hot hot. Didn't think I would like the alien aspect but it didn't really change my feeling of the story. All in all not a bad read.,1
"Everytime I have tried to use the search function, my Kindle totally freezes up.  I can go to the table of contents for my chapter, but then to get to the verse, I must page through each through each individual page or else my Kindle stops completely and I have turn it off to get it to work again.  Even turning it off is difficult, my Kindle balks at that and it takes several tries to actually torn it off.  it is evidently not properly formatted for my eReader.",0
"Having grown up on a diet of Sherlock Holmes, I was keen to see how this compared. My recollection of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works, it being some time since I read them,  is that they are difficult to beat. The language in this book is a little archaic but with the help of the Kindle dictionary this wasn't too much of a problem. Not sure I would have said the same if the dictionary had not been available. I enjoyed this enough to buy volume 2.",1
Interesting storiesStudying these lives of the prophets gives insight into the difficulties of &#34;growing&#34; the early church and overcoming barriers,1
"Although this title only costs $1, I still expected an ending. The sample was good, but I wish the Author had made the story a lot shorter, and then perhaps there would have been room/time to actually write a proper ending.Be warned if you like the sample, be prepared for a lot more of the same thing over and over and then the story abruptly ends. I wish I had simply stopped with the sample, but I thought what do I have to lose - it's only $1. In retrospect my time was lost. I have so many other titles waiting to be read.",0
"This book was extremely cliche. The sex scenes were okay, but it was annoying most times. Also VERY unrealistic, but that may be a personal preference. I prefer my works of fiction to be grounded in a sense.",0
I was trying my best to get into the book it was just too much or the flow just wasn't right for me! Kim was doing a little to much and really it didnt add up to me! I read up to half the book hoping it would bring me in but it didnt ! When u find yourself skipping pages to find the good part its time to give it up !,0
"Not even Gone with the Wind, then again I don't much like Gone With the Wind.  This is a light, imaginative erotic book.  Lots of fun, and a good read.  The author has put together a future with multiple species, each with their own characteristics but reminds us the basic weaknesses and actions will no doubt be with us eternally.  I'm looking forward to the next installation of the series, which will no doubt again give me several hours of escapist reading pleasure.",1
"I enjoyed everything about this book. The sci-fi, the physics, the action, the plot, the characters. I couldn't put it down, as good stuff just kept on coming, page after page. A tremendous value at the kindle price. Heck, I would have bought this in hardcover. I can't wait until David Erickson releases his next title.",1
"Brenda Novak's  Dundee, Idaho series is a joy to read.  Good plot,interesting believable characters and &#34;everydaysituations involving &#34;everydaa&#34; type of stories that are interesting yet common to just about anyone.  Well written ina good flowing style that does not get too hung up on mundane &#34;fillers&#34;",1
"This book has a good basic storyline.  However, I found the writing to be of a rather jerky and staccato style, especially in the descriptive areas.  It was rather difficult to follow at times as it jumps around a bit and with the formatting problems (quite a few) I found myself trying to figure out where I was in the story. It took me longer to read than it should have because of that. Reformatting would definitely help you keep track of what is happening. I did feel that there were a few things that could have been left out of the story as they really weren't incorporated into the storyline very well, just seemed to be thrown in because you have to be explicit about some things (x-rated).  Thank goodness for the fast page turnings on the Kindle! Even with all this, I still wanted to keep reading to find out what happened.",0
I so happy that Libby & Quinn got a there own little story. I love reading about this family. I feel that I'm apart of the family myself.,1
Short and sweet and doesn't pretend to be any more than it is so overall this was an ok read.  Would I read more?  Probably not!  I like a little more depth with the sex but then again it was written well and easy to read.,0
"This is a typical Jules Vern with all the advanced science beyond the times.A very good read, hard to put down sometimes.",1

"Check out my review at Escape by Fiction - [...]My rating: 4 of 5 starsI really liked it.Growing up, Bethany had been abused and raped by her psychotic step-father. She testified and had him put in jail after he tried to kill her. Afterwards, her mother blamed her for what happened and booted her out, as a teenager.Jacob, a Hugh Heifner type guys (owns same kind of magazine, has mansion, has lots of young girls around him all the time), likes to help out young ladies whenever he sees one he knows needs it. He spies Beth working at a strip club and sees a lonely, desperate teenagers in need of dire help. Jacob invites Bethany to stay with him and his ""family"" hoping to be a positive father figure in her life.Jump ahead 5 years, I think, and Bethany has not only gone to college and been a model for the magazine, but works as a top photographer for it. Bethany has heard about what Derrick (Jacob's reluctant son) and Nathan like to do with women in their spare time. Even though they've flirted with her over the years, she always thought they were kidding - even though she hoped they weren't.Derrick and Nathan have been drooling over Beth for a long time now, and now they think she's ready for what they have to offer her. Except when one of them gets 'extra' close to her first, the jealousy bug starts to burrow it's way into the situation. The guys argue, tension is high but Beth can't decide between the two of them - she loves them both.Meanwhile, Beth's crazy step-father has been released form prison early and is out to get his revenge on her. He kills her mother, whom she is estranged from and plots an evil plan to show Bethany who she really belongs to and to take out the men he thinks has touched what belongs to him.Attempts are made on lives, there are parties abound and lots of hot lovin' going on. The trio concoct a plan to trap the evil-stepfather and low and behold HEA.I liked this one quite a bit. I enjoyed the action/danger element a lot. Although there was a lot of hot, hot lovin' going on - it wasn't PWOP and I liked that. I liked the contrast between the men: Nathan was happy go lucky and tender while Derrick was serious and intense. I think if there had been tears, it totally would have been a 5 - as it is it's a very high 4.",1
"Warning, it is a short story (still learning the words v page conversion).  HOWEVER, it is fabulous!!!  I wish it were longer!!  This niche of killer against killer is so little utilized, and this book shows you why that is a travesty!!  Written well enough that you find yourself rooting for their deaths while mourning the loss of great characters!  I WANT MORE!",1
"No. Just no.I bought this because I found it on a list of books that contain a specific plot twist I usually enjoy, and I usually like this author's work. I couldn't even finish it though because it made me angry. I get the tendency that some authors have to fall back on the 'you're my mate, so we're instantly in love/lust' plotline, but I hated the way it was handled in this book.Neil and Ryan had spent many years as sex slaves, with the physical, mental and emotional trauma that entails.  I've seen authors handle this type of situation in a realistic, sensitive manner, but it is barely even addressed in this book before the main characters begin a physical relationship. Instead, the author would have us believe that all of that just disappeared when they met Gabe, because of the mating bond. The author had them willing and even eager to jump into bed with Gabe within 24 hours of meeting him, even though he was a large intimidating man similar to the men who held them, the men they were apparently terrified of.I consider this a cop out, using the instant love, instant trust 'mating bond' because an author is too lazy to, or incapable of actually addressing the deeper issues involved in the aftermath of abuse. I realize this is fiction, and fantasy fiction at that, but really, if you can't write about this kind of issue in anything even remotely resembling a realistic manner, then don't write about it at all.",0
"I hate to be the almost lone dissenter here, but 72 hours is a story told at break neck speed losing what could have been a very good story and turning it into just ok.  I kept wanting to say, ""Whoa, slow down.  Let's learn about the characters before they go running off to be super heroes.""The Devlin Group is a group who stops Big Bad things from happening - like spreading poison all over Gitmo.Alex Rossi is the Super Hero leader who, at one time, worked with Grace, the Super Heroine. They were a great team with both of them equally able to get to the bad guys.  Alex also doubles as Sean Devlin, the founder of the Group.  He named the group Devlin to flush out the man who killed his Mother 11 years ago.  Grace was not aware of this story.  Alex and Grace had a baby but Alex was never told about him because Grace wanted to keep the baby, Danny, safe from the Super Hero's enemies.  All of this is for naught as Danny is kidnapped.  While this sounds somewhat complicated, Stacey does a good job of keeping things clear and the reader is never confused as to the story line.There are two other major characters, Carmen and Gallagher, who also help with the Devlin Group.The downside is that this adventure/romance is told so fast that there is little character development.  I know about as much about Carmen and Gallagher as you do right now. There was a whole story there left on the cutting room floor, so to speak, and the book would have been much better if Stacey had taken the time to allow the reader an insight into these two characters.Alex and Grace are somewhat better developed but still leave a bit to be desired.  Grace comes off somewhat naive in the ways of motherhood, to put it nicely.  For some reason we never know, she thinks being able to make cookies is more important in the raising of a child than allowing said child to get to know his father.  Go figure.  I still want to know what makes Grace tick.Stacey has talent but needs to learn a little about character development.  If the reader knows the characters, they care what happens to them.  While this is an exciting story, I never really cared if the characters lived or died except for what would happen to the child.",0

"Ok!The story was not to my liking. It was a sweet story but it just never drew me in.  It lack substance, that special thing that draws the you in.  Sorry but it lacked something.",0
A better then average tale.Price point is great.Easy read.Good book for a slow nite.There are some twists and turns to the story that keep the reader interested.I liked the half breed part and the plot with-in it.For the money you can't go wrong.It's by no means a great novel but well told and interesting.For readers who like fantasy it is enjoyable.A good book to bring new fantasy readers into the fold.,1
"Got to chapter 6 and could not go any further.  The author, I noticed tried to make this light and humorous and sexual and exciting but I just did not feel that in the words when I read them... the dialog, plot, everything was just...empty.  I like the idea and the concept of the book.  I think if the writer had spent more time developing instead of pulling every old cliche out of the cliche closet where they have been stored for a reason, it would have been a better book.",0
"In this, slice of real hell and torture that has become my reality, sometimes a good book is the only way to escape Hades and the very real demons set on either killing me or driving me insane. Thanks Gena for providing an outlet for me to hide for a few when I just want time to myself.",1
"I loved this book. Miranda is wonderful. An innocent girl, an uncaring family, a cad, and a hero.  Plus characters from another book to welcome me.  I'm a bit miffed at the people that transcribed the story, as they seemed to have problems with spelling.  The child's name is Rose!!!  But the story itself was delicious.",1
"I have to admit, I figured this book was an erotic version of ""Beauty and the Beast"", but I was surprised that I enjoyed this story more than I thought I would.  Lila, a nurse, compromises herself in order to help her father keep his store.  Hunter is a very wealthy developer whose car accident has left him disfigured and often times cruel.  At first I had a hard time with Hunter.  I have to say, I'm not usually one for stories where the ""Hero"" is more of a beast than man, but after reading this story, I realized that Hunter never knew true love, and was never really shown it. It was a little rough in the beginning, but I can't lie...the sex was HOT HOT HOT!! For something different, and if you can have an open mind, I think you would enjoy this story.",1
Predictable. Was glad it was not any longer than it was. Thankfully it was free. Would have been a waste of money otherwise.,0
"This was a cozy mystery from an established series. Agatha, her friends and family, live in the high desert of California. And in this book, someone is killed, but just who did it? And although the victim wasn't well liked, she had enough money so she didn't care. And Aggie, of course, has the coolest head and figures out the mixed up mess.This was a bit muddled, and the badly edited grammer did nothing but detract from the story, partially because the mistake (primarily with plurals and possesives and apostrophes) weren't even consistant.I  wouldn't go out of my way to find any others in the series, but might read another if I ran across it. It feels a bit as if the authoir took Jessica Fletcher and Miss Marple and morphed them into one person",0
"This short historical story focuses more on the romance between these two not-so-strangers than the love scenes.  A very sensual, very sweet story of two lonely hearts finally finding each other. 'Unmasking' would have been more appropriate in the title than 'unlacing,' but I guess that works too. Happy reading!",1
"I just lost 6 hours of my life that perhaps would have been better spent repeatedly smacking my head into a brick wall or getting a rusty drill, anesthetic free root canal from Orin Scrivello. The first book was OK, the writing wasn't great but the story made it worth the continued read. This one, oh dear god. Raea spends the entire book vacillating between rhapsodising about Elis' eyes, hair, touch, smell etc, and having debates in her head about who is/may be/probably double crossing her. Elis spends the whole time, literally, in tears. It went something like this. This reminds me of Elis, oh I miss him, oh if only I had paid attention, oh I can't wait to feel his arms around me, oh if only I could have realised earlier that I love him. Rinse repeat. Over and over and over and....you get the point. And that wasn't the only bit of repetition, we get told the same exact thing again and again, seriously, I counted at least four places where the same paragraph imparts the same information, almost verbatim. And what is with this girl and slapping people in the face? She's a little slap happy. The only interesting thing about this book was that it introduced us to Inar'Ahben but only in the most basic sense. Quite a horrid little exercise in frustration this one, I suggest you move along as there's very little to see here.",0

I dont know but it seems like i read this before i got half way done and was ready to move on to something else it started out real good and just went overboard to me and it wasnt going anywhere for me! Just ok but not bad but predictable!,0
"Silly plot and very, very atrocious editing. There were so many omitted words that were replaced by question marks. I want my money back. Argghh!",0
"I started out reading this expecting your typical ""love story"".  Well, once I had read a few pages, I literally could not stop until I was done.It's an odd take of the Beauty and the Beast kind of story but with a twist that makes it incredible and hard to put down.It definitely is a feel good story that ends with a happy ending but also leaving the reader with a lesson.  I found that is what made it so awesome to me.  Most romance stories just have the happily ever after thing and that's it.  However this book left me with a lesson about life.  It really is a very well written short story and one I would definitely recommend to anyone.  You don't have to just be a ""romance"" genre reader to enjoy this story.",1
"This is the story of two college room-mates who play ""gay-chicken"" raise money by posing for m/m pictures and surprise surprise decide that they're in love. While this is one step above one-handed friction fiction, it is a nicely told story and a dose of fantasy fulfillment for those that like that sort of thing. It is NOT great literature and never poses as it. What it is is a fast fun read for someone who doesn't want characters that are too deeply developed and a plot that never turns too gloomy.I was hoping for something a bit more but in all reality, this did deliver pretty much what it promised.",0
"The description given of this story begins ""Alycia's always possessed an affinity for cats, big and small."" This should have been my first clue that this was gonna be a really weird read.This story just freaked me out. A human woman having sex with a 6 ft 5 feline man is a strange thought. All I could picture was Tony the Tiger getting his groove on with a sister. Not a  good image.The erotic scenes used words such as 'fur' and 'paws' to describe him. Please tell me what human woman (unless she is mentally unstable) wants to have relations with someone (or something in this case) with FUR or PAWS? That is just gross. Nothing in Barrick's physical description would make me want to get with him. I was waiting for him to cough up a furball.I will have to pass on this series. Sorry.",0
"Let me first say that I enjoy Brenda Jackson's character development. Each Westmoreland male is interesting and unique. The heroines are all professional, intelligent, ""virgins"". Surprisingly each heroine is a virgin over the age of 25 with the exception of Madison who had one prior sexual experience. In my opinion it is not realistic of your average woman over 25 years of age to be a virgin (while ideal and sweet not realistic). But I still say that Brenda Jackson's characters are wonderful. In the family of the Westmoreland's it is believed that they will all marry a person with whom they fall in love with at first sight. Love at first sight was believable with brothers Dare and Storm. Their love interests were women they had known for years. I did not buy the ""love at first sight"" theme between Delaney Westmoreland and Prince Jamal nor Stone and Madison. Again, romantic idea but unbelievable. The other three I bought it and loved it.I most enjoyed A Little Dare, it was my favorite of the first 5 books. Thorn Westmoreland is my favorite character from the series. I enjoyed his story as well. Stone Cold Surrender and Riding the Storm are the reasons I'm giving this review 3.5 stars. I thought the heroines were a bit extreme.  Madison tracking her 50 year old mom in the mountains of Montana and Jayla yet in her 20's choosing to be artificially inseminated because she's lonely. I thought that was extremely selfish. However each story has a satisfying end. Stone Cold Surrender has the redeeming aspect of Corey and Abby finding each other after so many years. I really enjoyed their part of the book. Their story touched my heart. I'm looking forward to reading the stories of the additional Westmoreland family members who were introduced.",1
It's nice to have an old stanby.  Stories still absorbing  Short enough to be read in less than an hour.  Variety good,1
"First book in ""Dakota Heat Anthology"". Followed byDakota Ranch Crude. Note thatDakota Heat, Volume 1appears to contain both (first two of 4), in paperback.Plot:Brothers Chase, Wolfe and Travis Dakota aim to seduce Stacy into spending the rest of her life with them. Maybe they should have let her know their plan?Comments:- Contemporary Cowboy Erotic Menage- 1430 kindle locations, 22,118 words- m/f, 1f:3m - very explicit, generous, loving, somewhat dominant, including outside, spanking for punishment, anal.Opinion:Big, strong, muscular Alpha male cowboys who have waited years for her ""to grow up"", so they could all have her, share her, love her. They protected her as much as they could from her father, they made her a home. And now the time was right for them to make her stay. And to do that they were going to love her into submission... Hmmm..Not as overwhelmingly Dominant as it could have been, with lots of hot sex; we are given a very steamy erotica story with a nice HEA. Is it believable? Who really cares? Sure, Stacy forgives and accepts awfully quickly, there's a lot of discussion of both the past and the future that is left unsaid. *shrug* Given the length of the book we couldn't really get much else in. More plot would have meant less smut, and we wouldn't have wanted that now, would we? In the end, Brooke gives us what we are after - lots of generous, loving, steamy sex with enough of a plot to hang it together. Enjoyable.-CR-",0
If you are hoping for a HEA hot romance look elsewhere.  Not at all what I was expecting or was somewhat led to believe in the product description. I am glad it was a freebie because the only thing wasted was my time.,0
"I really enjoyed this whole series, and wish there were more.  I also read the Bear one, and can't wait til she comes out with the next in that series, which kinda continues this one.  They aren't too long, but neither do you feel cheated by brevity.  This one involves an eye doctor and a legally blind puma with ""ex issues"".  There is plenty of intrigue and hot protective feelings going on.  And I really especially enjoyed that these books all allow further glimpses into the characters met in previous books.  Very enjoyable!",1
"I didn't realize this book was a novella when I bought it on Kindle, so I was disappointed at its brevity.  It's your typical Charlie Parker story--light & entertaining, but it ends abruptly.  Possibly could have been developed into a full length book.",0

"To say I enjoyed this book would almost seem unkind however, I did enjoy the book not because of the suffering and  unbelievable cruelty inflicted upon the  Jews and those opposed to the Nazis in WWII, but because of their great bravery.  I was encouraged by the tenacity of those who so bravely fought to survive.  May we never forget the great men and woman who suffered and died and those who fought till the end.",1
"I did enjoy this book.  It moved a little fast, but given the time restraints I could see it.  The Daddy was a a little on the harsh side as well, but again it worked with the story.  I think my favorite part was the ending though.  That make the read worth it.",1
"This tale left me wanting...it turned out to be a ""wham, bam, thank you ma'am"" for the most part.  The story was so short that there was no time for character building or background or rhyme or reason.  I didn't really find it ""steamy"" or ""erotic"", so other than the author's ability to portray the time period adequately...there really wasn't much else going for this one.  Sorry, but it only rates two stars with me.",0
"As the story of Lorna and James went on, I was pleasantly surprised with the way the author ended their story. Their story takes place in London and the spelling, grammar and lingo is very much England. Sometimes a little hard to follow but you catch on as you keep reading. All in all a good read.",1
This is a waste of time. Don't read this unless you are stranded on a desert island with only this book.,0
"It took me several tries to actually get into this book, but once I got started I liked the characters and was at least starting to develop an interest in them and their relationships.  However, the book leaves you hanging as none of the story lines are resolved.  For this reason I gave it only two stars.  It seems less than fair to me to write a book with several different plot lines and not tie up any of the loose ends.Unfortunately, I don't really care enough about the characters to run right out and purchase the next installment either.  After all, who knows haw many installments I'll have to buy to get to the end of the story.  Or will this be like a soap opera, and just go on and on and on?I read this book on my Kindle and did not notice any glaring editing or formatting errors.",0

His methods of putting end to wars is not admirable because of the killings but you cannot help but liking this character after all...",1
"Professor Hardwigg finds a note written by Arne Saknussem inside of a scientific text  that says he journeyed to the center of the Earth.  Determined to do the same and become famous for it, Hardwigg and his nephew pack up and go to Iceland to follow in Saknussem's footsteps.Although the science is rather dated, the book is still a good read and held my attention throughout.  It was interesting to see how far science has come and to realize that some of the things we think of as truths now may be proven wrong in the future.  This was a good old adventure story and I would recommend it.",1
"Griffin is a man on flight. His family wants him dead and he has no one and no where to go. He is young and smart but in an post apocaliptic world he is alone. And one night, in an alley, he is shot dead. Or he thinks so. But then Jarrah arrives to help him.Jarrah is a vampire. A former doctor he cherishes the human life above all. And he hates himself to be a vampire. And like Griffin, he is alone.Griffin is immediately drawn by the vampire, better by the man, although it is the first time he feels sexual desire for a man. But it is not a gay thing, it is the need of a lonely soul to share its feeling. And doesn't matter if this soul is of a man. Love is above the gender.A very beautiful novel, very intimate and close: for the most part shared between the two characters, it has also very well written sex scenes.",1
I was not impressed with this book and do not recommend it.  I was expecting more but I was highly disappointed.,0
"This was the choice for our book club this month and I thought it sounded like something I would have liked. I was wrong. The book has great potential but it's missing everything that is important to me in a book. I don't want to sound harsh because maybe this was a first attempt at writing; but if I read the word &#34;such&#34; again I may scream! &#34;Such&#34; was used at least one time in nine out of every ten pages.Secondly, what the hell is wrong with Diona? This guy has held you hostage on an island! Sure it's paradise but he still held her there against your will. And for what? To prevent his brother from marrying this girl??? But it seems the only thing that mattered to her is the tingles she gets between her legs at his appearance! She even goes as far as to give him her V card?!?!?!? A man she knows NOTHING about, who believes she is someone she isn't, and who has KIDNAPPED her??? What the hell?Nikias is described as a smart, intuitive, sharp business man. However, he doesn't even know his brother's fianc&eacute;'s name prior to kidnapping her? He investigates her location however, doesn't know anything about the woman he is trying to keep from his brother? Completely unrealistic.I never felt the chemistry between Diona and Nkias. I was bored throughout the entire book and disappointed",0

"These stories aren't written badly, but they struck me as emotionally ""off"" or tone deaf.  Fiction about abuse -- whether physical or emotional -- can take us places that are difficult, places that are unfamiliar or maybe sadly familiar.  But in each story, I found myself thinking that people wouldn't act that way or think that way -- things were a little too pat, a little too rushed.  Language was a bit careless, observations were a little bit off.It's hard to specify exactly what seemed off about these stories but it was almost as if I was reading a collection of stories written by somebody who hadn't had much more exposure to father/child dynamics than watching a Lifetime movie marathon.",0

Slow read. Very slow. Only for Elvis fanatics. This book mainly refers to a what if situation concerning Elvis. It is not a mystery.,0
"The combination of an artist heroine and male romance writer hero sounded like an interesting combination.  Unfortunately, there was precious little about the characters' occupations and their influence on their lives.  Rather, we are treated to a lot of extraneous detail ""frosting"" about the characters' clothes, the city they live in, the food they eat, and their living quarters, the setting for a series of sex scenes which are amazingly predictable.  The characters are contemporary romance archetypes, and their problems are happily solved in the last fifteen pages through fantastic sex.  If only life were like this.I didn't pay anything for this book, and I deleted it from my library.",0
I am going to help the Beginners out on this one. You can get the first one for ANYWHERE from zero to 99cents. or Save even bigger dough and buy them in groups of threes1-3  4-6 7-9 get those groups and save big.Hey if you even half way think you like the sample. Then fork out the bucks and save. So many have that it seems to be the only way to fly. Unless you have a Peacekeeper car. I want one I want one Heck I just want a stack of metal and I will build my own magic flying carpet ride.Ricky has to have been born and raised in the south. That is why we have a hero with the name of Jim Bob.  No his name is not Jim Bob. It is just JIM.Still it give you a pause.On a personal basis I loved each and every one of the books in this 9 part series the action was always on the beat and the typos or mistakes were very minimal Yes I did find a few things like reading about the mans piers instead of the mans peers meaning his contemporaries. Still that does not take away from the whole experience of the reading of these great group of books. I loved them loved them loved them. It takes you from the days leading up to the Apocalypses and then to the years trying to bring about a recovery. There are starts and stops and false starts and stops Let us hope that it could be such a great help from technology.All in all you miss this series and you loose a great read and some thought provoking ideas.dray,1
"Just look at my other reviews of this series.  I truly enjoyed these books, and look forward to reading more from Jack Shane.",1
"As with the first book of the series, grammar issues come close to ruining this otherwise good book.This writer has massive difficulties with pronouns. She is constantly mixing up the use of him/himself, she/herself, he/him, she/her, and I/me.It is like hitting a brick wall when this happens, taking the reader completely out of the flow of the story.I even came across one spot where she uses grammar properly in one sentence, then in the very next one, makes a mistake in the same type of wording she just used correctly. Very frustrating.",0
This story started out with promise but fizzled fast. Even a short story should pack a punch. The sex was dull and the words used to describe the sex where lame. I can over look editing errors if the story is great... not a great read.,0
"Reading the conversations was enjoyable - so much so that I finished the book in one long sitting.I am not sure what happened in the end - what were those mysterious papers? This is one of those books that you finish and exclaim ""That was fun but so what?"". Looking for a follow-up.His character descriptions are excellent - Gloria especially. I know people just like her.So 4 stars for conversations and descriptions, and an enticing but ultimately non-satisfied plot.",1
"I enjoyed this book, and unlike another reviewer, I didn't really find the characterizations thin.  I liked Henry, and I thought his living arrangements had a lot of potential in subsequent books (and boy, would I like his house!).  I also liked the amount of detail that was given. Another reviewer referred to it as 'padding'.  Maybe it is, but I also liked the way it gave the story immediacy - you felt like you were right there, watching the goings-on.  The concept of a retired police chief helping out with current cases is no more or less implausible than most of the premises for most mysteries.  All things considered, most police departments nowadays would jump on the chance to have an expert, unpaid, consultant available!  I thought that the plot was interesting, the victim just 'shady' enough to be realistic.  My big gripe, if it can be called that, was with the ending when the murderer was revealed.  I don't necessarily dislike the author's decision on who should be First Murderer, but I didn't like the way he presented it - it was too sudden, too abrupt, and the clues leading to their identity were a bit too subtle and got lost in the shuffle, so to speak. If the author had eased Henry into his realization of who the murderer was more gradually and provided one more clue that pointed to that person, I think the ending would've been immeasureably improved.  All in all, this was a pleasant, easy read with a bit of a twist at the end.  I'd recommend it.Note on Kindle formatting:  Good.  There were a couple of issues, but nothing to distract from the reading experience.",1
"Both of these that I've read we're good. Short, yes, but good reads. I think I might look into more of her books soon.",1
"I already liked the cheeky hero from reading about him in the first book, An Inconvenient Duchess. Always love a bad boy! What makes this story so funny to me is him trying his best to stay out of the heroine's clutches (well, not really clutches) and maintaining his honor.  It is quite the turn around from a rakish hellion!  I started and finished the story in one day - it is a quick - but satisfying - read.  It flows smoothly and has just enough tension.  It isn't deep but it is good and I'm heading out to find more of her stories!",1
"Quick, brutal and amazing! As a fan of anything that makes you think twice, I recommend this one. Unlike many 'shorts', this one stayed out of my archives and was recommended to friends. Wonderful character development and was a 30 minute can not put down read.",1
"The premise of this book is a pretty good one:  bioterrorism coming from a disenfranchised segment of our own population.Unfortunately, that's as good as it gets.  The books randomly wanders backward in time.  The ""hero"" of the book is primarily stuck emotionally as a teenager.  He calls the prison office manager mom, and he talks and thinks about girls like a chaste fifteen-year-old (except during the flashbacks).The point of view changes from person to person, and without notice.  Everyone's thoughts, including a chemist and high-level alphabet agency personnel, are immature and remarkably random.  There's gratuitous sex, and by that I mean that a main character picks up a girl in a strip joint and abuses her, badly.  It's not too graphic, but it has nothing to do with the story, except to make it more obvious that the character's a bad guy.  I like sex in my books, but this was just totally unnecessary to the plot, and the scenes felt like afterthoughts.  Next time, author?  Just leave them out unless they serve a purpose.The chemist is a Vietnam veteran, and his first experience with The Wall is poignant and touching and probably the best part of the entire book.The case is solved, singlehandedly, by the ""hero,"" who happens upon boxes full of current network information for a major chemical company.  Yeah, because some major American corporation is going to just print out usernames and passwords, toss the papers into boxes and send them to the recycler.  Said recycler just happens to be a prisoner who mines all that information to snoop on the company's network and outfox everybody, including a CIA agent.  I suspended my disbelief for the duration of the book, because many things were implausible, even to my non-secret-agent knowledge.Once the case is solved and the bad guys are caught in the act, the book ends.  Fffffft!  No loose ends tied up, no resolution for any of the characters, just done.  Buh-bye.Bottom line is, I could have enjoyed this book, and have enjoyed others which presented similar theorems.  Instead, I was relieved to get to the end of the book, so I could move on to something else.",0
"The Remnants: Stories of the Jewish Resistance.By Othneil J. SeidenI loved this book! I wasn't sure what to expect when I got it, but upon reading the forward I was prepared for a wonderful historical novel. What I got was even better! I got a novel that was so based in fact and true stories that almost every encounter, every event, could be looked up and backed by historical fact. I did.I love a book that takes me so deep in the history of an event and makes it all so real that it sends me into research mode to verify things and learn more. This book did this in spades. What should have been a day or two read, turned into almost a week because I had to keep stopping and looking things up; I have over two pages of notes on events and people and rumors that I had to chase down. And Mr. Seiden never disappointed me, every part was true, from the Trench at Babi Yar, to the constant gun fire going on there by the Nazi's once they invaded Kiev. The fact that Soviet held countries, the Jews in particular, welcomed the German's as liberators from the prejudice, suppressive Communist party, only to find themselves in worse shape than they were before. The small bands of resistance fighters, turning into larger bands, the woods of Russia and the Russian weather providing the native fighters hiding places and advantages over the better equip German army. The pain of the bands too far away to heed the calls from the Warsaw Ghetto when they had their uprising Passover of 1943, and with each call they knew that no one was going to help them, not the closer resistance groups, not the allies, no one went the aid of these people that fought for over a month with no back up.The mob mentality of the people, turning on their neighbor's wasn't a surprise to me, having learned all this from a historical view point growing up more than 40 years after the fact, but in this author's writing I can see that it wasn't a surprise to him either, or his characters he writes about, having been pushed to the background, into slums, ignored by their government and spit up on by their peers over time, they expected it. The Pogrom's that the Church organized and the Government looked the other way during which they went in and massacred as many Jews as they could for centuries. What surprised them was the way the supposedly civilized German people treated them. The dislike and distrust of the Vatican and the Catholics in general, the people of the time had came through loud and clear in this work, but what came through also was the belief that people could go against what they had been taught all their life. By accepting some Genitals into their group, and trusting the fledgling groups location and plans to the couple that saved Solomon, and the Priest that spoke against the killings, and later sent Jews to them, and eventually joined them; yes, Mr. Seiden was able see all sides of the fallible humans that got caught in Hitler's quest for power and world domination.I give this book a rating of five solid stars, and am recommending it to any of my friends that have any type of interest in this area of history. Thank you for writing this book, and for giving me something new to learn about a time I thought I had pretty much exhausted all avenues on. I loved every part of this book, every death cut me, but I know it was war and it wasn't going to be pretty going into it. There wouldn't be roses and birds singing all through the story line, but they were there when it was most unexpected. A great tale very carefully and thoroughly researched and plotted out. Thank you for sharing it.",1
"If there were a recipe for the perfect book, Dana Marie Bell would be a master chef. Steel Beauty has all the ingredients for a fun and fantastic reading experience. Start with one sexy Alpha male who is anxious to claim his mate. Add his chosen mate, who just happens to be a Puma. Into the mix add one bitch with the desire to take the mates place as pack Luna, and stir in humor, action and some very spicy bedroom action. Garnish with politics and pack protocol, and you have one fantastic book.Steel Beauty is the fourth of Dana Marie Bell's Halle Puma stories, and it is a fun book to read. There are places where I laughed out loud. The heroine, Belinda ""Belle"" Campbell has to face several hardships in the beginning of this book. The steps Belle takes once she gets to the Pack lodge to take her place as Luna are hilarious. The passage at the beginning of the book, with Belle and Rick texting each other is an imaginative use of technology and a great piece of comic relief. Belle continues to handle things with grace, humor and just a little bit of underhandedness. Do Belle and Rick get their happily ever after? Will Rick ever get the air horn away from Belle? Pick up a copy of Steel Beauty to find those answers.Dana Marie Bell writes such believable characters, and I became lost in the world of the Poconos Wolves and the Halle Pumas. I wonder if anyone else would have dared to pair an Alpha wolf and a Puma as life mates. I enjoyed the banter between Belle and Rick, and there were places she made me laugh out loud at the antics Belle got up to in order to thwart Gina over and over. I also cried at the pain and suffering she endured in order to make it to the happily ever after that she and Rick so richly deserved. I had never read the Halle Puma books before this one, but I bought the other three in the series after reading this one, because Dana Marie Bell created a world I wish I could go and visit, and I will time and again through these books.Originally posted at [....]",1

"This book is poorly written, badly conceived, and a waste of time to read.  I was incredibly disappointed. The book spends 99% of the time describing the disaster that accompanies the discovery of the tomb of Akenaton, and then ends with a teaser, set in the present time.  Don't bother to read it, it's a real waste of time.",0
"Very interesting & well written, although it goes very dark and keeps getting darker, so could be a big downer for some people.",1
Basically the same storyline as the first slight different characters. Again I am happen that Kimberly and Anthony ended up together. Loved the fact that Niche made a chance in his life and he and Amanda decided to get married. Let's see what will happen to Lethal Heart in the next part. Good book.,1
I have read almost all of Ms. James books. This is by far my favorite. Anyone that has been married for a length of time can relate. Saying what you think and feel is not always easy. Also wanting or needing it is easy to become so focused you alienate the other person. She did such a brilliant job of showing that. It is so clear that they love each other you can't help but root for them.  It will bring a tear to your eye but in the end you smile because meant to be is sometimes enough.,1
A book narrating the struggles and suffering of the Jewish people during and after the Nazi and Russian occupation of Europe during World War II.  There are various stories from different characters which help understand a bit better that horrendous and shameful part of the history called the holocaust.  A good reading.,0
It continues to amaze me how Verne could write stories and novels with such brilliant forethought and logic for the future.,1
"I own several styles of tablet cases and this is one of them but it is not my favorite primarily because it is made of thinner material and does not provide as much protection as the other cases I own.  It is not bad and the price is down to a lower level where it makes it attractive to some.It is made of neoprene stretch material and it has a faux leather portion on the front and back to give you a better grip.  The neoprene would be to slippery to hang onto while carrying your tablet.  It does protect your tablet from minor bumps and scratches but like I said, I have other cases that I feel are much more padded and provide better protection.If you are low on a budget then this case is not bad and it is better than carrying an unprotected tablet.  It is well made and it features a sturdy zipper close with dual zipper pulls for ease of opening and closing.  It will keep your tablet clean and protect it from spills but provide average or below average protection from drops.It may be too big for some size tablets and your device may feel loose in the case. The case only opens on two sides and you have to remove your tablet to use it.  This means that while using your tablet it is unprotected so this is something to consider when buying this type of case.  If you want full time protection then this case is not for you.  The advantage that this case has over cases that offer full time protection is that when you are holding your tablet and using it, you do not have the added weight of a case to also have to support. That reduces hand and arm strain if you are reading over long periods of time.",0

"This book was WAY too short for the storyline (yeah, usually I complain about the opposite too). The plot was intriguing, interesting and very different - and let's face it, a lot of books out there are just a constant rehash. There were so many different ways the author could have taken it, but it ended so quickly. I wonder why she chose to not delve deeper into the characters and flesh out the plot? This book could have been absolutely fabulous, instead it feels like an unfinished book. I give it 4 stars for the great book idea alone. I hope the author decides to do something else with this idea or maybe build off of what she has here.",1

Chloe leaves the next morning planning on never to see Sean again. Chloe stumbling into her work office after a night of wild sex to find that Sean is her new boss! But she has bigger issues at hand ( if that's possible). Someone at the company is stealing millions of dollars and her name is attached to the crime. Finding ways to prove her innocence and to keep clear of that fine hunk of a new boss she just inherited, Chloe must choose between years in prison of a crime she didn't commit or trusting a complete stranger to her clear her name. What you get at the end is a true shocker.If you're looking specifically for a book that is all about the sex and less romance, then this is a good choice. The book holds your interest with having a suspense flare to its plot.However I had problems. One thing that turned me off with the book was how Chloe was such a weak women. For someone trying to clear their name of fraud, she was too timid in my opinion when she needed to be more aggressive. Secondly, I didn't like the fact she let her boss use her sexual as she did because she'd been in a one-night-stand with him. At times, I was screaming for her to speak the hell up! Please! However, I find this to be a reoccurring problem with lots of IR erotica/romance books. The women are very strong sexual but not as strong outside the bedroom their so much or reserved. Would be nice to see less of that.Overall, I still thought the book was a good read and would recommend it.",0
This is a very good case for the kindle DX. No it is not hard but it will protect from those short drops like if u knock it off the night stand. More important it will keep your kindle warm if you leave it for an hour or so in a cold car while shopping. Cold and electronics do not play nicely.,1
"Right now, as I write this review, the kindle price of the book is 0.00. This annoys the living humbug out of me as I had to pay 2.99 for this thing.(ok... calming down now)This book is the reason why one must read book descriptions carefully. I originally thought that this would be about a modern girl going to the past to meet her ARTHURIAN KNIGHT. This was not the case.In the end it was basically ""Twilight"" with knights. As someone who isn't fond of Twilight you can imagine this did not sit well with me at all.I can't say that this was a terrible book. It will have it's fans. I'm just not going to be one of them. In fact, if I had known what I was getting into I wouldn't have bought it at all, and this review wouldn't exist to lower it's rating (and I mean this not in an angry way, rather as a matter of fact). So to those who will be fans of this series my apologies (again, i mean this with all sincerity and without irony.)The biggest criticism I have for this book would be that it needs a better ""Book Description"" or blurb, to help keep people like me, who haven't any interest in such things, away, and to bring in it's proper target audience.2 stars, because of personal preference against ""Twilight"" like books. It would have been a 3 if they hadn't LOWERED THE PRICE to 0.00 making me pay 2.99 for something that is now FREE!",0
"This piece is well written in a dark, perverse, way.  I just am puzzled about what the message is here. To depict children as mean spirited monsters is to negate the innocence of childhood.  I did not like this at all!!!",0
"Moves like one of the classics. Good plot.  Good writing.  If you like stories about successful underdogs, this is your book.",1
"I was misled by the cover to think I was getting a Manga. That aside, I found this to be difficult to follow and barely made through the first few pages. I enjoy yaoi and love paranormal romance/erotica, but this book was not for me.",0
"This was a short read. I enjoyed it, but it seemed like it was to quick for me. I like stories alittle bit longer.",0
"I guess as far as a short story go, it was good.  But short stories always leave you wanting more.  There was no climax or plot in the story.  They met and Gabriel had to convince her to trust him but there was really nothing to build on.  Abby didn't see him turn into a wolf, she just took his word for it. And the whole story was based in the house.",0
"In some ways, a short story is harder to write than a novel - especially for a story like this one that is fantasy/science fiction. I thought the author did a good job of introducing her world - there wasn't an explanation of why civilization collapsed, was the problem confined to the U.S. and other questions, but there didn't really need to be (at least for the story's purposes. I would like to see more explanation in the trilogy). The 2 main characters were interesting enough that I cared what happened to them. The writing style was easy to follow If a bit simplistic. It definitely interested me enough to purchase the first book of the series.",1
"I don't write review but needed to say this, I was about to not buy this book but changed my mind at the last second. First I love their chemestry and the fact that they both had issues. Both main characters where great I love all what Zack did, very sneaky but smart. Arielle was not a push over she was strong where she needed to be but gave in when she needed too. I love that they where made for each other perfect. I loved this book and can say it was worth reading. Enjoy......",1
"Gregor is living the high life. He has been dubbed the Vampire King of New York - a cheeky title that the media love without realizing how close it hits to the truth. Gregor is the second eldest of the Faustin brothers; from the Russian vampyr family line. He runs a series of successful clubs, made famous for the fact that they cater to New York's vampire population - a publicity cachet the clubbers love, and the vampyrs appreciate. Gregor has his pick of women, and is at the top of his game, so the last thing he needs is for fate to interrupt his life. But when you're a Faustin vampyr, you have to listen when destiny speaks . . . or suffer the consequences.Gregor is told the name of his intended bride - Madelena. But Gregor ignores the heads-up and continues on his partying ways . . . unsuspecting, until fate intervenes with a crash.`Bound by Blood' is the second book in Evie Byrne's `Faustin Brothers' trilogy. Though it is the second book, the plot timing seems a little out-of-sync with first book `Called by Blood'. In this book, Alex is a rampant bachelor and is yet to meet his wife, Helena. So really, it would make more sense that `Bound' be the first book in this trilogy, instead of the second ...I am really liking Evie Byrne's `Faustin' trilogy. I love the fact that Byrne is writing a modern vampire tale - her characters are clued-up about vampiric myths and fanged pop-culture icons, but there's also an old-world vibe. Each brother finds his bride through premonition - fated by their mother who has dreams of her future daughters-in-law. In `Called' Alex was ecstatic to finally find his bride, partly because his older brother had recently settled so well into holy matrimony. But as we back-track, it's revealed that Gregor in fact found fate to be rather inconvenient. I love that Byrne marries some old-world mysticism with modern inconvenience - a New York vampire club owner who is put-out by his destined bride. Hilarity ensues when fate intervenes, brutally.In `Called by Blood', Byrne took a very different romantic route - by severely burning her Alpha hero, and leaving him looking like raw hamburger meat. Byrne does it again in `Bound', this time posing a difficult dilemma before the heroine. I won't give it away, but I really liked the hurdle before Gregor and Madelena, if only because it completely turned the tables on the traditional vampire/mortal romance.I like Evie Byrne's paranormal romance. Once again, I wish the book had been longer, mostly because I think the really interesting part of the story would have come in the aftermath of the romance. But again, wishing a book to be longer is a fairly decent complaint.",1
"Sorry, I was expecting something more interesting. I couldn't get past 10 pages and I had to stop reading. If I knew how to skip to the 2nd or 3rd story I would have tried them so it didn't get a good rating from me.",0
This was actually part of the Dragon Knight series but introduced some characters that would be beneficial to the upcoming books in that series.  If you are looking for hot sex then this has it but it also has a great story line and introduces characters that become common place as the Dragon Knights series progresses.  The young woman in this book was of strong character although a little lost and we actually saw some flaws in the Dragon Knights she becomes involved with.  I liked where the author took this story and look forward to more in this series.,1
"Heath and Colt Hardin had been best friends since elementary school.  Kylie Halston came to live with them freshman year of college and they had been best friends ever since.  Kylie, Heath and Colt were playing a game of `Tequila Truth.'  They had played this game since college, but on Heath's 25th birthday things took an interesting turn - one question - `What is your ultimate sex fantasy?' - And Kylie's answer - {after hearing the guys fantasies in detail} `In my ultimate sex fantasy, two guys are taking me the same way you both described...at the same time.` - makes for an interesting weekend.Six months later - Ever since Heath's birthday they had become obsessed with fulfilling Kylie's ultimate sexual fantasy but, she was currently seeing someone.  She wouldn't even tell them the guy's name.  Colt, a police detective, was always running background checks and with Heath's help ran the guy off.  The guys noticed that after Heath's birthday Kylie had been doing stupid and dangerous things, trying to explore her sexuality - so they decided that they would give her what she wants, fulfill all of her fantasies.This story was written in a very free-flowing style.  This book exceeded my expectations.  The story line was good and the sex scenes were phenomenal - both passionate and emotional.  The scenes were not over erotic - there was a good balance of emotion and detail.  The author did a great job of building a solid foundation of friendship.  Then extending it into a sexual relationship built on that foundation.  I have added this author to my watch list.  The relationships in this book are m/f/m and m/f - no m/m.~~ An excerpt fromErotic Researchis found at the end of this Kindle book ~~",1
"I made it through about 40% before I deleted it. Although the writing was fair (but with a major problem with possessives), it just seemed kind of blah. I couldn't seem to get into it. Even as a free read, it felt like I was wasting my time.I know that's not much of a review; but I since I rarely just give up on a book, I feel it's valid to note.Since it was free, no loss.",0
A nice read but nothing spectacular.,0
"The title drew me in, Something scarry lives under the stairs.  I was so dissapointed for what could have been a good read for me turned out to be a waste of time.  Don't recommed it.",0
The story holds my attention and the details of the areas are fantastic.  Would recommend this author to anyone that likes mysteries and like feeling like they are in the area of the story.,1
Disappointed. I had no idea it was a short story.....and I do mean short.  Glad it was a free kindle book.,0
"It's a very nice version for Kindle. There's no pictures, only  the cartoons,  but the content wich is the most important  is exactely the same as in  the printed version and we can browse the magazine by sectors in a very well diagramed table of contents. The  affordable price is a passport for this traditional publication.",1

"Despite her pronounced limp, Professor Briony Swift is extremely good at her job so she's stunned when two of her A students hand her drop class requests.  She can't deny that seeing Nic and Leo in class every day has been a pleasure.  They're certainly the stars of many of her more erotic fantasies but they're students and therefore off limits.Nic Potter and Leo Phelps only enrolled in Briony's class so that they could get closer to her.  Neither of them needs the credit for her class in order to graduate and they feel it's time to make their true intentions toward Briony known.  They've seen her watching them and are aware that her desire for them is as strong as theirs is for her but there are ethics involved and convincing her to give them a chance is going to be more complicated than they initially thought.Nic and Leo's feelings for Briony go beyond sexual desire.  They honestly want to build a future with her.  However, their initial approach and suggestion that they have dinner together doesn't go over so well - especially once Nic blurts out the full extent of their sexual plans for her.  Briony's intelligent enough to know that the classroom is her safe haven and any non-academic involvement with Nic and Leo will be frowned upon.  That doesn't stop her from fanaticizing about them though.  Be that as it may, it's only a matter of time before she caves in to her own desires and takes Nic and Leo to her bed.  Just when it looks like they could possibly have a future together disaster strikes and their secret rendezvous are discovered.  Faced with the choice of career or her men Briony has some heavy decisions to make.Brynn Paulin's TWO PLUS ONE dives headfirst into the quandary of ethics versus desire.  Briony's a wonderful teacher who has always toed the line when it comes to her career.  Nic and Leo initially appear to be nothing more than college students hell bent on bedding the teacher but as you'll discover there's much more to them than meets the eye.  What I love about this story is watching Briony grow from a jittery unsure woman to one who stands up for herself and what she believes to be right.  Her disability and her career has been a crutch for her for so long that she's lost sight of what could truly make her happy so it brought a smile to my face to imagine Nic and Leo's determination to make her see herself the way they see her.  TWO PLUS ONE is one hot story full of steamy sex, raw sensuality and lots of little surprises as this trio works toward finding a way to build a future together.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
since this was the first of a line there could have been more story and history of the pack.. I enjoyed the book,0
the editor should be sued! there many spelling mistakes grammatical errors and word usage and tense usage mistakes. basic premise ok. this stinker should have been offered free...six wasted dollars.  shame on me!,0
I listened to this book through audible and was just floored.  it is a different story not the same old same old.  I read a lot and this one was totally different --the whole story with the two killers going after the &#34;bad guys&#34; and the two different POVs.  the killers and the FBI agent.  if you read alot and want a story with a different plot and story lineread this !,1
Anne Michaels is about to enjoy a cup of coffee when suddenly she is being chased by a green creature.  Caleb Verona and Van Childress save her and take her to their world. Caleb and Van explain to Anne what's going on then tell her that she is their destined mate. Anne considers herself open minded but what Caleb and Van tell her is just too unbelievable. The proof is all around her though.Taken is a sexy and unique story. There is enough realism slipped in with the fantasy to make it believable. Caleb and Van would be simply irresistible to any woman. Anne baulks at what's happened to her but the beauty of Caleb and Van's world and their seductive loving persuades her.

"Releasing Kate is a very different take on the world of BDSM. Edward belongs to a ""clan"" and Kate does too, but she doesn't know it. Her parents died in an accident when she was little and she went into the foster system. The clan didn't know she existed so she was raised as a ""normal"" person. Her sex life is unsatisfactory but she doesn't know why, until Edward takes over as CEO of the hospital where she works. He immediately starts on a brutal campaign to convince Kate that she belongs with him and only him, and to do that, he must initiate her into the ways of the clan.This involves some serious mind games and even more serious BDSM equipment -- Edward must convince Kate to let him dominate her completely and since she was raised as a normal woman, this goes against every thing she has ever been taught. He tells her; ""You will never again have pain without pleasure and you will never again have pleasure without pain."" And he means it.Only once do Edward and Kate actually have intercourse -- 99% of the sex scenes in the book (and there are a lot of them) involve Edward arousing Kate -- sometimes to the point of orgasm, many times not, but always with some sort of pain.  The sex scenes are sometimes steamy and sometimes tiring. It gets a bit old after a while, the constant torture without no clit throbbing sex scenes to make it more palatable. While the entire story asks the reader to suspend disbelief, the most difficult part for me to swallow (no pun intended) is that Edward is so ""well endowed"" that he cannot enter Kate without causing her great pain. Really?I give Kade points for an unusual plotline, but I can't say I really enjoyed the book and I'm not dying to read anything else by her soon.  This is Book One in a series so there will be more to follow. Disclaimer: I did not pay for this book.",0
I haven't finished them all yet but I will. Worth the money if you just want to escape from all the high tech gadgets and be closer to man's instinct to survive.,1

"I was EXCITED to read this book. I Love these kind of historical romance novels~a little magic and mayhem make them fun.  They are few and far between and hard to find.Since there weren't any reviews I downloaded a sample, it  was lovely, so I bought the book.  It was $5.11 for my Kindle, around average for a FULL LENGTH ebook.  Imagine my suprise when I realized after 20 mins. of reading, I was 60% thru the book!  Nowhere in the book description does it say Novella or Short Story, PLUS the book ends way before 100%(93% approx)they don't give page numbers, sorry non-Kindlers.  That's the only way I can give the book length! So, I paid full book price and got the equivalent of 4-6 chapters.BUT, I think the actual story itself was decent. If it could be expanded upon and made into a full length book, it would be worthy of it's price and I would have given it 4 stars(If it had been a good rewrite of course!)I do think that Amazon should perhaps make it mandatory for authors of books/novellas/short stories under a certain word count to inform their readers of the length of the book.  It's not right to pay for and expect a full length book yet get something entirely different.  EVEN IF the story is cute.  Most of the other stories around this length run from $.99-$1.99.  I know I am complaining, ALOT!!!  It's just that I got REALLY lucky(haha) and had this happen to me several times in just a couple of days!Happy Reading,DawnBee",0
I liked the plot but the dialogue was so horrible it made me rush through this very short book so that I didn't have to hear them talking in my head as I read.  Very amateurish.,0
"Ok I admit I need to pause a minute to write this review.  This is such a different plot line than other reads. This is most like Terminal Freeze by Lincoln Child.  The whole idea of a relic creature.  Just enough science to hold my interest, but both the characters and the story line could have been expanded on they where both a little light and not enough details.  I would enjoy reading additional stories by Dallas Tanner.",0

"Maybe I didn't look too hard at the spelling or grammar problems.  I just enjoyed the story.  I had this book on my Kindle for almost a year and I figured it was about time I checked it out.  I am glad I did.  Nowhere as scary asThe Mistby Stephen King.  This really is a story about how a group of kids survive (for several years) being isloated from the rest of the world.  With no adults for awhile, and even then, with a young 14 old leader, called the Chief.  I am in my 50's and I liked the way Morris wrote his story.  If he ever decided to add to the story with a sequel, I would check it out.  Suitable for kids from 12 on up.",0
"With this getting so many 5 star reviews I thought it had to be a very good short. Sorry it was not even a half star book. I'm sorry I wasted  my time reading it. The character is from the middle east, the book starts there & has flashbacks to there. It's a lucky thing we were told this because the flow of the writing & character has a very American feel, she doesn't watch TV, but she was watching a show.... You know I could pick this book to pieces but then I'd be wasting your time & mine & I've wasted to much time on this book. I'm shocked it ever made it to a series.",0
this story plot line is a little mess up and to short but a good enough book to read if your just reading to eat up time.,0
"I am revising my review DOWN to one star, based on this author's responses to negative reviews, including mine. First he says he's not getting into ""a pissing contest"" with me, yet he had no trouble doing so with three or four other one-star reviewers (which he conveniently disremembers)...excuse me, one exception: He sicced his ""professional editor"" Sally Berneathy on Mr. Spadaro.Among one-star comments: ""reminded me of Nancy Drew...could have been written by a teenage girl,"" ""silly,"" ""makes no sense,"" ""dialogue is horrible,"" ""complete boredom,"" ""story is implausible,"" ""cheap and nasty,"" ""absolutely appalling,"" ""one dimensional as if a 13 year old wrote this,"" ""pedestrian,"" ""a first draft that appears to merit no further effort,"" ""bad grammar, syntax, punctuation...completely unrealistic characters, pages of pointless 'cute' banter that no one who has ever actually talked to an adult would dare call realistic,"" ""the text is simple, the plot is simple, the characters are simple,"" ""Moats should have paid me,"" ""who are these people that gave it a 4 or 5 star rating...I hope they don't live in my neighborhood,"" ""...even at this price (free) this book is a ripoff...who edited this? Someone's baby brother?"", ""reads like a dropout loser's fantasy,"" ""writing is usually sophomoric, at times schoolgirl giddy, and always bad,"" ""writing style is awful. Painful even. Lifeless sentences, tired descriptions,"" and Mr. Moats calls ME ""mean"". He also points out that he has legions of followers who applaud his work: I'm happy he has a large extended family.And the final nail: ""All of this combined with the rude responses to other Amazon reviewers by the author and I'm done with this guy for good."" AMEN.""Holy crap,"" he said, then put it between covers, titled it ""Classmate Murders"" and called it a book. I'm still not giving it a one-star because it DID improve. Somewhat.Let me get this straight. An 60-year-old, twice-divorced, unemployed (by choice, having determined his EMPLOYERS to be ""stupid"" and ""jerks"") car lot security guard who lives with his parents (supposedly helping Mom after Dad suffered a stroke but in return for a few chores and errands apparently gets room and board, gratis*) takes it upon himself to stick his nose into two murder cases simply because he went to school 40-some years earlier with the victims?And on what planet would a police investigator disclose pertinent facts of an ongoing murder investigation to - again, a 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - AND cautions this uninvolved third party not to reveal said facts to the press? AND quick-as-a-bunny deem him an ""unofficial civilian advisor""?And the first thing said - again, 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - uninvolved third party does is spill his guts about the murder (by now plural) and the ""closely police-guarded/ongoing investigation"" facts to his best friend, also - you guessed it - a (concealed-weapon licensed) automobile car lot security guard.Another sticking point: A smart, attractive, sexy 60-year-old semi-celebrity woman may have become reunited with a former boyfriend after 40-some years for some slap-and-tickle, but believe me - NO woman in such a position and still in possession of her mental faculties would completely ignore the fact that the former boyfriend - in 40-some years - had no higher achievement or aspiration than to become a - again - 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents.That's not suspending your disbelief, it's taking it out into a dark alley and shooting it point-blank through the forehead. That would have been more of a mercy killing than having, at long last, come to the end of ""Classmate Murders"".After reading 19% I had to go back and start over again to make sure I wasn't missing something. Tragically, I wasn't.On a positive note, a little further on the plot does get considerably more interesting. Whether it's interesting enough to overcome its unfortunate beginning and the foul taste left in my mouth from this unfortunate choice of protagonist ""attributes"" is up to the reader to decide.About the only thing I could recommend this book for would be as a classic study in character history and personality traits NOT to give your protagonist. Okay, he's a good guy, has a sense of right and wrong, is kind to his parents and hasn't kicked any dogs by the end of the book. Beyond that, as a general rule I don't require that a book's plot be 100% ""believable"" or even a remote semblance of real life. Still and all, THIS one was completely out of the realm of even MY sense of plausibility.To give Mr. Moats the benefit of the doubt I did read the excerpt from the next book in the series, ""Vegas Show Girl Murders,"" and while it might appear at first blush to be an improvement on 'Classmate', my sense is that the character hurdles enumerated at the beginning of this review are going to be difficult to bury. Still and all - as long as I can get ""Vegas"" for free - I will probably give it a try and hope for better things. For everybody.For those keeping score, here are the standings as far as heads-ups for most reviewers' declared turnoffs:1.) Profanity is present but not excessive;2.) No paranormal, supernatural, sci-fi, or magic components;3.) Little, non-gooey, romance;4.) No graphic sex (note the protagonist, ""has occasional sexual encounters, just not with another human being."");5.) Incest between half-sibs is mentioned;6.) No religious or alternative lifestyle agenda or promotion;7.) Some violence of a low-gory (but not grisly) nature, one non-gory incident of torture;8.) No cliffhanger ending;9.) Grammar and punctuation police, have at it, examples of what you will find:""She carefully taped the ends together and produced a nice spark."" (tape-ing would have produced noth-ing, tapping would have been more productive)""My curiosity was peaked.""""...but no one seems knows where.""*after all, the protagonist does confess to having split the money his MOM gave him for gas (for HIS car which is used primarily for HIS job) between the car's needs and his own need for BEER",0
a lot of Bianca D'Arc since I found the first paperback in a book exchange store. It was Lords of the Were. After that I was hooked on her books.

"Brody Nash has the perfect idea for the one year anniversary of his relationship with his girlfriend Sidney - a m&eacute;nage with his best friend Drew.  Brody loves Sidney and sharing her with anyone would never have even come up if he hadn't noticed that some of her preferred reads involve m&eacute;nage relationships.Drew Buchanan isn't the settling down kind of guy and he never stays with any one woman for very long.  He leads more of a nomadic lifestyle and often sails off on his yacht aptly named `Sunset.'  He's a brilliant desert chef and creates his delectable treats for Brody's restaurant, The Blue Fish Grill, whenever he's in Graceville but he's finding it harder and harder to stay in town especially since he's in love with Sidney.Sidney McCall has always lived a nomadic lifestyle.  Her mother never stayed in one place very long and she simply continued the lifestyle she already knew - until she met Brody.  They quickly moved from the initial meeting to living together and even a year after the fact, Sidney still feels like it's all a dream.In celebration of their first anniversary together Sidney plans to surprise Brody with a delicious meal along with a sexy outfit when he returns home from the restaurant - and succeeds.  Brady had intended to tell Sidney that he'd invited Drew over and about his surprise but one look at her in her sexy dress and all his brain cells headed south.  Dinner's put on hold while they satisfy other hungers - until they hear the knock at the door and then Brody remembers that he still has to tell her about his `gift.'  Sidney can't deny an attraction to Drew and even though she isn't entirely comfortable with the idea of sex with two men at the same time it is a fantasy of hers and if it's alright with the men then who is she to argue.  Things turn decidedly odd afterwards and Sidney's not sure what to think about Drew's cold disinterested attitude and to make things even more complicated Brody notices her preoccupation and assumes that it's more than just friendly concern.Sami Lee delves into what could happen when the thing you fantasize about turns out to be the exact opposite of what you truly desire.  Sidney and Brody are deeply in love with each other but neither of them are truly certain of the others feelings.  I found the dynamics between these three characters to be oddly fascinating but at the same time understand why Drew's held himself apart from Brady and Sidney.  I'd love to know what happened with Drew after this story ends.  He's a special guy who deserves a little happiness in his life and a special woman.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1

"Scott Wyatt may be blind, but he can see a good thing when it is right in front of him.  And Tara Patrick definitely fits under the good thing category.  Scott has been biding his time just waiting for his chance to show Tara they can be more than just friends.  With her recent break-up from her louse of a boyfriend and her subsequent need to show the bum she is serious about the break-up, Scott offers himself up to play the part of her new boyfriend.  Of course, Scott just happens to be into method acting, and this is the role of his lifetime...Tara isn't so sure about Scott's plan - especially when it involves moving in with him, albeit temporarily.  But when his family makes her a business offer that is too good to be true, she can't refuse.  One little problem: how will she ever be able to keep her hands off her hunky friend while living in such close proximity?  Scott could never be interested in a woman like her - could he?Fans of Annmarie McKenna's work will be delighted when they recognize the hero of Look What Santa Brought as the very same Scott Wyatt we first met in her book Blackmailed.  Yes, this is the same Scott that is Brianna's little brother!  Of course, this new story takes place years later and Scott is one very sexy adult man now, ready for his own shot at romance with the woman of his dreams.Scott has certainly grown up right, now running his own business and enjoying life almost to the fullest.  The only thing missing in his life is love.  Sure, his looks pave the way for him with most women, but many regard him as nothing more than a curious fling due to his blindness.  Tara is one of the few women that treats him just like any other man, which he most certainly is.  Despite his disability, Scott is more than capable of taking care of both himself and the woman he loves.Tara is a woman in a situation many of us have unexpectedly found ourselves in at one time of having suddenly found herself in a potentially abusive relationship.  Determined to rid herself of the man trying to control her life and stand on her own, she is at first understandably reluctant to accept Scott's offer to help.  That reluctance only increases as things take a dangerous turn and she is unwilling to put either Scott or his family at risk.  Of course, the valiant Scott is not one to take no for an answer, especially regarding the safety of the woman he has loved for so long.Although a short story, Look What Santa Brought affords us a `where are they now' glimpse into the lives of Scott's sister and her men, reinforcing one happy ever after while delivering another in the form of Scott and Tara's relationship.This sexy little story may have a holiday theme, but Look What Santa Brought is undeniably a story that will be enjoyed by romance fans no matter the time of year. I know it will enjoy a permanent place in my library so I may re-read it at will in the years to come.Connected Stories:Blackmailed**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**",1
"Second Chance Romance was a sweet story, but there was a lot of errors in grammar.  The basic plot could have been made into a beautiful story with the right writer.  I would not recommend.",0
"I have only purchased this book by this author and I'm glad. I coudn't get past the 1st paragraph before I was distacted by grammatical errors. I am not usually so picky, but dang! The tense changed in one sentence! I was disappointed. I may never read this book and it will be a shame. It probably is a good story and I missed it because of bad editing.",0
"If you are looking for some heat this holiday season then this short story will warm you up. What could be the worst thing to do at the company Christmas party? Go home with the boss. But heck, Angela knows she's good and she can find another job and Ryan is utterly delicious. But when she agreed to go home with him she wasn't expecting that he'd have his best friend there.Of course Ryan didn't expect it either. Wade is ruggedly handsome, a cowboy. Ryan is sophisticated model good looking. I mean... what more can a girl ask for Christmas? I'd say she was a good girl this year!Ryan has never had a problem sharing women with Wade in the past but something about Angie wakes every possessive instinctive.This story is short and it is an erotica story so there's a lot of sex and not a lot of the actual storyline so if you're looking for something hot then this will be for you.Toe Curling Rating: 4",0
"Dakota Wells is so weary of having to live in fear all the time.  Since her father's death, she has been on her own fighting off her neighbor Ed Franks attempts to buy her spread.  Ed had even managed to have her credit cut off in town, and had intimidated everyone so completely; they refused to sell her any goods at all.  When two gorgeous cowboys showed up looking for work, she was skeptical of their motives right away.  It would not be the first time that Ed had arranged for spies to infiltrate her employment for nefarious purposes.  Dakota normally relied on her gut instinct when it came to her judgment of others, and she honestly didn't believe Joe Taylor and Colt Mason were out to harm her.Joe and Colt were very intrigued with the little spitfire that held them at gunpoint.  They had heard a little about her dire circumstances, and couldn't believe she was still able to stand her ground.  While they were there for personal reasons, helping this woman that got to them, had immediately become paramount.  All three had an immediate connection, and both men intended to explore it wherever it took them.I have enjoyed the Dakota Heat series.  In this offering we are introduced to Dakota, who has had to develop immeasurable strength just to survive.  She has had the weight of the world on her shoulders for so long, she has forgotten what it is like not to live in fear.  She is afraid to believe in the strength and pleasure these men bring into her life.  Dakota is a delightful character written with a hard backbone, but yet she is very vulnerable below the surface.  She is well matched with equally strong men Joe and Colt.  These two men haven't lived an easy life, and even though they have every reason to have hardened hearts, with Dakota, they are whole and loving.  There are some very erotic passages that will leave your blood boiling that the author has crafted within a good story.  This is a recommended read!",1

"Overall, I was absorbed in this story and the semi-abrupt ending has really left me for wanting more.  Don't get me wrong on the ending though.  It was abrupt only in the fact that I wanted to know more and there wasn't any.  I've already checked out Kaye's site and the only other novel listed is Angelic Avenger, which I don't believe is in this series.  I'm 99.9% sure of that one.  So, I'm going to be hoping there's more to this story in the future because I really want to know.  Definitely a great read for anyone looking for something new.For my full review, check out Literary Escapism.",1

I always enjoy the treats Brenda Jackson serves. She has romantic way of telling a love story.  I'm always intrigued. Good read 4 books 4 a splendid price...,1
"First book in ""Cannon Pack"" series. Followed byDance on the Wilde Side.Plot:Sydney's family are ""Hunters"" - they hunt werewolves (Shifters). As in, shoot them and hang their heads on your walls. Sydney's problem is she a) doesn't want to hunt and b) has erotic dreams of a hunky shifter. When the embodiment of her dreams, Jason, saves her from being eaten by a vicious treadmill, her life (and his!) is never going to be the same.Comments:- Quite a long book (5074 kindle locations).- Bedroom scenes are spicy rather than erotic (not particularly frequent), all m/f with constant references to gay friend and cross-dressing.- It is a different/original take on the human/Shifter relationship (redneck hunters vs suited Shifters), with lots of story and plot.- When I picked up this book, it was on some sort of promotion and thus $0. It isn't now. However, as stated by another reviewer, the cost of the book doesn't really affect my view of the book. Either it's good or it isn't. And because cost fluctuates, it is unfair to judge it based on price.Opinion:This book is quite funny, and enjoyable, however I didn't like it enough to search out Book 2. The characters are strong and interesting enough but the book could have been half the size and still covered the same material. There isn't anything particularly wrong with this book, it does okay for a light Shifter book. It just didn't grab me as much as other books in the paranormal genre.",0
"While I managed to finish this book, I found that the more I read it the more I disliked it.  The hero is a rapist, and the heroine a weak-willed, simpering idiot.  Ugh!  No thanks.",0
"Another one I need to add to my can't believe I waited so long to read this list. It picks up the pace quickly and moves right along until the end.Gabriel is kind of a cocky ass at times, but once you learn more about him, it is hard not to like him. He is a total wiseass and had me chuckling out loud more than once.Antonio is one hell of a sexy Spaniard. I loved his way of speaking and could almost hear that sexy accent whispering in my ear. He and Gabriel are smoking together and comploment each other perfectly.I would read more about these two any time.",1
"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 6/10PROS:- I love the idea of eternal love and soul mates, and very few storylines can get away with that as easily as the ""werewolf meets his mate"" one. They see each other the first time and just know that they were made for each other. (see cons below also)- The characters are cheesy and stereotypical, but I must admit to finding a guilty sort of pleasure in reading about small, victimized men who are rescued by their heroic, strapping lovers. Sasha is THE stereotype of a helpless damsel in distress like those so popular in the bodice-ripping romances of years ago. And Vadim is, of course, the perfect Alpha. Strong and imposing yet utterly selfless and kind. He's quick to anger, but only when someone's being taken advantage of or he discovers injustice in the world.- There's never a shortage of action and drama in Glenn's stories. The characters get over one hurdle, have sex, get over another hurdle, have sex, misread each other and separate, make up and have sex, and so on.- This story takes the mental communication between werewolf mates to a deeper level than I've seen in other stories. I liked not only seeing Vadim and Sasha carry on entire conversations no one else can hear, but also seeing other mated couples engaged in discussions no one else is privy to and having to guess at what they're saying based on their body language.CONS:- As much as I love stories about werewolves and their life mates, the idea that a character can meet someone and automatically be in love with him seems to me like a lazy storytelling technique sometimes. The author doesn't have to put any effort into establishing an emotional connection or building up sexual tension. It's just there. Bang. In this story, the characters have performed the mating ritual (which is basically akin to marriage, with no option of divorce) before Sasha even knows Vadim's name.- The writing tends to be shallow and repetitive sometimes. This occurs near the beginning, for example: ""The little man was his now""...and then a few paragraphs later: ""The sexy man beneath the desk was no longer theirs. He belonged to Vadim now.""- The whole book reads like a first draft that was written in about 2 weeks and then never edited. There are obvious editing errors throughout, and the story incorporates a large number of clich&eacute;s and hackneyed phrases. Some of the typos are so blatant it seems like the author didn't even read the story over before it was published, much less an editor.Overall comments: Glenn's stories have a tendency toward over-the-top drama, as is evident at the end of the first paragraph of this story: the two main guys meet and immediately recognize that they're mates, and Vadim is ""stunned!"" (I didn't add the exclamation point; it's in the book.) But I keep reading her stories, because in spite of their soap-opera feel, they're entertaining little diversions.",0
"Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed this short little novella.  It was a fascinating concept to, for once, have the tables turned.  As the story progressed, I was beginning to see the ending coming, but I always wondered just who it was that was going to come out on top.  The way this author ended this short, quaint little story had me laughing at the end, which gave me some very interested looks from people sitting around me.  It was twisted, and it was perfect.  A dose of your own medicine, indeed.  I would like to read more of this author's.  The only negative I can really say is that I would've liked to get to know the players a little better.  I was teased with a taste, and then it was ripped from me.  That, though, was part of the enjoyment, and it kept me wanting to find out more, and had me guessing about what the author didn't actually tell us.  Overall, enjoyable for a quick read.",1

"Margaret is 23 with no prospects of marriage and a 14 year old brother to support.  When she answered ad for an educated companion for a gentleman she soon discovered just what kind of companionship he was after, but because he was so lonely she continued to correspond with him and when he offered her 20 pounds to simply meet she couldn't refuse.  She soon realizes that the man is none other than her childhood hero badly wounded at war and in desperate need of comfort so she agrees to be his mistress for 2 months.I have to start out by saying the people who give his book 1 star for only being an e-book and 2 stars because it's an novella are doing it a disservice.  This is a very sweet tale and well worth reading.  The cover doesn't do it justice as it makes the book look like an erotica, there is only one love scene and it is nicely done.  Though the book could have been a bit longer I very much enjoyed Margaret as she tried to get Graham to open up and Graham as he fights her all the way.This is only about a 30 min to 1 hour read so the price might be a bit steep but I quite enjoyed it.4 1/2 stars.",1
"As umimpressesed as I was with the first book I thought in all fairness I would give the second book a chance. (It was a cheap download) Total and complete mistake!  This book has no substance. The storyline is boring, the fight scene is laughable, and it didnt start off where the first book ended.  It took all of my will just to finish the book, I kept hoping that something would enlighten me, that something never occured. Im pretty sure I could figure out the plot of the next book and how things will end without actually reading it.  If your looking for a cheap read with an occasional sex scene then this is for you.",0
"I like the author and liked the style of writing for this story.  It was definitely VERY different then past stories but it was cleverly done.  I wish the ending had been better, but I can see why it needed to end that way.**I purchased this book on another website**",0
I read this book twice to make sure I was as happy with it as I thought.  I knew is was a short book when I bought it  and actually felt bad when I finsihed it.  The story line was great and the charcters were well thought out.  I did however wish is was longer so there was less of a rush to get the book finished.,1

"It's the end of the world... and I feel fine after reading this. Unfortunately, woman are ridiculously marginalized and I really hope in a crisis that more then one person without testicles could step up and contribute to the creation of a brave new world. Surviving the Fog was a fun guilty pleasure, like a movie of the week on the sci-fi channel... you aren't expecting grand art and you are getting a good time.",1
This is a wonderful sequel. I love how Oliver managed to overcome his inertia & take control of his life. I also liked how he was able to demand more from Vincent. To demand he (Vincent) be open & honest about how he felt about Oliver. The kinky stuff was incidental to this story in this book but what Ava March gave us was beautifully portrayed as usual. This is essential reading if you love Oliver & Vincent but wouldn't work well as a stand-alone book.It should be noted that there are at least 2 free short stories in this series which aren't listed on Amazon.

"A pregnant mother and her thirteen-year-old son flee an abusive home to find shelter in anonymity. Fate leads them to the small village of the boy's deceased father and a flat provided by the housing council. When they find ominous messages scribbled beneath peeling wallpaper they make their first chore in the new home a paint-over of the walls. But the messages put fear into the boy while a unique cane carried by the lady from the council disquiets his mom. With that foreshadowing the author cleverly sets up a climate of foreboding that lets the reader know more dire circumstances will follow.The excerpt sadly ends here, but the synopsis of Coombe's Wood promises that there are secrets in the adjacent woods. This reader is eager to discover what those secrets are.",1
"Like a modern Lord of the Flies.  Very good story, keeps you riveted waiting for the next challenge or threat.  Modern kids with modern ideas, forced to survive the unknown.  A good read",1

I really don't understand how this got such good ratings because I found this to be quite boring. There wasn't anything remotely interesting about this book. There just wasn't much of a story to keep me interested. It's a good thing it's free.,0
At first I didn't like these super zombies and was annoyed that they could talk and stuff.  The story grew on me and left me anxious to start reading the next book.,1
"This is the most frustrating book I have read in a long time. The blurb sounded great but the moment I started reading I regretted it. I found myself skimming more than reading because the story was too confusing to do anything else. In the story, the heroine, Tammy, use of words/language was jolting throughout the story. She seemed to speak as though she was out of touch with reality, then again, maybe she was. The story timeline is so off that I had a hard time distinguishing how much time had passed. The sex scenes seemed forced and only added in because the author had to make this a romance somehow. It has been a long time since I felt like I have wasted my money on a book and I have to say this was one. I think this author has potential but it definitely wasn't reached here.  I can't recommend this book.",0

"Kaya is a shape-shifter, and having been left behind by her family she's spent most of her life as a cougar in the wild. She's been watching Jericho and Hunter, two men who live in an isolated cabin, and they have been watching her. When she is hurt, she allows them to help her--and they discover that their wild cougar companion is in fact a beautiful woman. They both form an attachment to her, and are reluctant to leave her even when their work calls them away.I liked that the plot was slow and mellow. It has a quiet, isolated feel that I found relaxing. It isn't an adventure story, and the paranormal element is uncomplicated and matter-of-fact. That simplicity really fit the story and set the tone.While reading this story, I spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how the author intended to characterize each of her protagonists. Kaya comes across as a bit weak and helpless, but then you have to bare in mind that she hasn't had much human contact. Still, I feel like the author could have spent a little time establishing that Kaya does have some innate strength, and isn't totally dependent on her men to provide for her. Hunter is portrayed as the more closed off, emotionally isolated of the two men. Why that is is never fully explained. I can't really get a handle on Jericho's personality at all, other than that he's a bit more open than Hunter. Both men are, of course, insanely protective and intent on caring for Kaya. I think part of the problem at work here is page limitation. It's a short book, so there is only a limited amount of time to establish everyone's personality and allow them to develop.My other ""complaint"" is the sunny, slightly sugar coated ending. Everyone is accepting of Kaya and her relationship with two men. Nobody comments or thinks it's odd. Everybody is just part of a big happy family. That's a bit unrealistic. But then, this book has shape-shifting so I guess I shouldn't demand realism.All told, for a novella you can read in one day, this is worthwhile. It has steam, emotion, and a fairly satisfying happy ending. 3.5 stars.",1

"The first Maggie Flaherty, Where There's a Will... was a delightful romp for a young attorney turned into a bumbling investigator.  10 c 's, the second novel in the series, fails to capitalize on the initial success and takes far too long getting to the end when the crime and most of the participants in the criminal activity were obvious very early in the story.  Maggie is a delightful character -- I hope her future cases are much more interesting and much better told.",0
"Typical EA read with a good simple yet twisted premise, the twist of course being that sex must be had. I enjoy reading these books because they are always straightforward about sex. In this case Kristen has a problem, Joe has a different problem and both of them need each other. Sexually. They solve the problem but then realize they have feelings for one another, it was like an adult version of a fable, I feel there was a lesson to be learned and that was don't give away things too easily, you may have lost them to find out that you really wanted them in the first place. Love it!!",0
"Becoming Miss Becky was just as great at the first book in this series, Taming Eliza Jane.  Miss Becky arrives in a small western Texas town, but she doesn't quite understand what her dead Aunt willed to her!

Not only does she figure out who she is as a woman, but she also discovers the Sheriff.  He's scary and willing to shoot anyone that looks at him the wrong way or calls his horse ugly, but he can't seem to get enough of Rebecca Hamilton.Another great book by Shannon Stacey that will make it hard to put the book down!",1
This book has a bunch of the same boring dialog with the too much involved family and not enough of the main characters just getting to know each other and developing their relationship. was a really hard book to read tough to get beyond the first couple of pages.,0
ok read. could of been more three way action. but written good can't complain. I would read another one of her books.,0
"I just finished this book and I have no idea why I kept with it.  Maybe I hoped it would improve...it didn't.  The ""plot"" is exposed early in the book and from there it just sort of repeats itself to finallllllly arrive at the conclusion which is no huge surprise once you get there.  I couldn't come up with a likeable character to cheer for in the entire book.  I think Uncle Sy was the fortunate one.  He died before the book started and missed the whole miserable episode.  I'm so glad it was free cause it was definitely well priced.",0

"I'm not quite familiar with this author, but I gave this book a try anyways. And I've got to say, I'm definitely looking forward to more stories by her. ""The Knife's Edge"" is a mixture of erotic romance, powerful suspense, and some added dark elements. The characters we're interesting and well developed. Another short story that comes to the mind that had similar character development isThe Mist Of Remembering: Erotic Romance Fantasyby Sandra Ross. However, this story had more of a dark tone to it that is satisfying to read.In ""The Knife's Edge"", you follow the interactions between two people, the beautiful and brave heroine Nestra who is the Queen of the realm and her trusty advisor Dardanus. Dardanus is an intelligent, devious character that has a dark secret that you will soon find out about him. This story is rather short so I don't want to tell you more otherwise you wouldn't get the most out of it. All I can say is the ending will definitely surprised because of the brilliant plot twist that the author, Stephanie Draven has implemented.You won't be disappointed if you love stories with a mixture of romance and suspense. It will put you on the edge of your seats throughout the story. However, I wished there was a sequel to this story since I really want to know what happens next. I can't wait to try out another one of her stories! I love it!",1
Very happy with the quality of this item.  Purchased from reading other reviews on this case.  The Kindle fits perfectly inside.  It is lightweight yet very durable.,1
"I thought with Christmas creeping closer and closer it was time for me to start reading some festive novels and get into the holiday spirit. I saw Holiday Bound recommended by Amazon in their free Kindle ebooks section and thought it would be perfect to start my Christmas reading.I found the premise interesting but unfortunately due to length issues Beth Kery did not explore the subject as thoroughly as I would have liked.Alex is an interesting and layered character (as layered as one can be in such a short novella), thankfully Beth Kery spends enough time to give us details about his background with his father so that the reader understands the complexity and problemacy of their relationship.However, somehow Beth Kery forgot about Angeline along the way and left her standing there without giving us some depth into how a woman who has been going out for 2 months with a man can after only spending a couple of hours together with that man's son sleep with him based on physical, sexual attraction. And even later, once her hormones subside, we don't get too much of a glimpse into the workings of Angeline's mind and feelings .My other complaint is the ending of the novel, I found it too improbable and a clich&eacute;, and I missed that after the big showdown between Mitch, Alex and Angeline nothing was resolved: neither Mitch and Alex, or Alex and Anegline or Angeline and Mitch spoke about the problem and what to do about the situation!Verdict: But overall the attraction between Alex and Angeline is sizzling, and the dominating yet protective alpha maleness of Alex will make anyone feel hot and bothered. A nice short book to read by the fire on a cold winter night.The cover is a great representation of the book, so you know what to expect when starting it: Holiday Bound is a sparkly festive, sexy and saucy story :-)Plot: 8/10Characters: 7/10Ending: 6/10Writing: 8/10Cover: 9/10",1

"I love the concept, the plot, and the steamy relationship. My only issue was the story is too short to really develop some of the emotional bits that the story ended with.

"This is my first time reading this author and all in all this is not a bad book. I finished it in a few hours. It really grabbed and held my interest in a Murder She Wrote/Matlock kind of way.  When I began reading it couldn't help but chuckle at the way the author introduces Jimmy. Lol.In my opinion, it is a nice mix of humour, murder/mystery and romance. Some aspects of the romance are a little ummm weird...but who am I to judge? :-)",1
This book was a good quick sexy read. very nice role reversal with the heroin not wanting a relationship only a fling. The ending is not a surprise for this genre but I loved it anyway.,1
This book was just not my cup of tea. The story line seemed weak and seemed to need more detail about Darq's life. I will admit the erotic scenes were scorching.,0

"I've read other books by Joshua Graham, so I picked this one up just because of his name. This one was not nearly as good as the others. The setting was unclear, and the characters were sketchy.

Sith Crash landing... and then the establishment of characters which didn't gain (me) any attachment. I didn;t care if they lived or died.it would have been more interesting to see Jedi crash landing and through necessity they turn into Sith.",0

"Gargoyle Damien is on a mission to find one of four missing artifacts important to his people.I liked Stone and Earth for what it was - short and steam packed insta-gargoyle-love. There's only a touch of a story to go with the sex, and that sex includes a coupling between witch Katie in human form while Damien is in gargoyle form (as soon as that tail made its appearance there is no doubt where it was going to end up eventually in one of the love scenes.) That said, Stone and Earth did somehow still managed to give a sense of the characters Gargoyle Damien with his sexy french accent and witch Katie who is open to becoming part of his world, so for an erotic quickie it was fine.I am pretty sure I got Stone and Earth for free, there are three other stories in this series - one for each element Earth, Sea, Air and Fire and the other gargoyles' mates sound interesting: selkie, dragon and harpy. I'd consider reading them if they ever go on sale for .99 (since they are so short.)",0
"I really like it when an author has the ability to get me to connect to the story and the world they are painting. This is the reason I have thoroughly enjoyed reading anything HKW writes. It's mystical, suspenseful, romantic, mysterious and when your done you may likely seek out more books by her.",1
"So, the woman went to a Halloween Party at a nightclub owned by a vampire, what did she expect wearing the vamp costume her workmate friend provided for her?  She considered herself to be &#34;over plump&#34; and coming off of a relationship, she appeared to be the most naive woman on the face of this earth; totally unaware that her friend had been turned and that she was in danger of the same.  An owner of the club saved her and brought her to his office which looked down on the crowd.  And they had sex, sex, and more sex until the mid-way into the book when she was being chased by the rogue vampire who wanted to change her, or at least have a good feed.  Haven't we read enough of these stories?",0
I enjoyed the romance of the story.  Very dreamy and sweet.  A great escape from a hard day with good thoughts on the brain before slumber. If that's what you're looking for this book is for you.,1
"I had great expectations when I started this book, but was let down. It took me forever to finish this book.  I always finish a book no matter how boring it is in hopes it will get better.",0
"As an ebook it reads very well on my Kindle, but it really doesn't seem to belong where it is. Maybe at the end of The Dark Nest Trilogy or Legacy of the Force, but it just seems not to have a place it belongs in the Star Wars universe. At least not to me.",0
Another good biography of the life of a prophet of the Church Lorenzo Snow.  It is interesting to have information about the lives of early leaders of the LDS Church.,1
"It reminded me of Beauty and the Beast. It's a short story so therefore it lacks some character depth. But all in all, a cute story!If you haven't read Evangeline's Brides of the Kindred books, they are full of action and sex, fabulous stories! The first one is Claimed and the second is Hunted. I can't wait for the next two..........You rock Evangeline!",0

"This is more than anything a promotional material, the story starts really good and then it just ends, bluntly, can't say much more without a spoiler alert but lets just say that if I had paid for this, I would be pissed. really pissed.",0
"I liked it quite a bit. I did have one major issue though. She repeatedly kept bringing up how beautiful his women have been over the years making her feel insecure about her looks and the amount of time they would actually be together. He could have completely cleared her mind if he would have just told what he told the reader, that of the 2 years she has worked for him, he has not been with another woman sexually for at least a year and a half. That would have let her know that those women were just set ups by his mom and that he only wants her. Another thing was her constantly thinking that his family would not approve even though they are nothing but nice to her and include her in everything. Also, the fact that he would not just tell her how he felt. He knew she thought some of their together time was work related and just kept laughing about her questions about notes instead of just saying we are on date. It was good in general though.",1
I really enjoyed this set !! I had gotten the free one (turned out it was the end of the series ) so I just had to go back and buy this bundle so that I could read them in order !!,1
"This guy is a good writer. He has a good story going on and several time I found myself totally engrossed in the story and couldnt wait to get back to it. The books, all of them, need a good editor to read them over and make some adjustments to grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc, but honestly, if you are just wanting to read and can ignore the odd bits here and there, its a good series to pick up.",0
The writing itself is fine but the behaviors of the characters are strange and juvenile. I realize its a romantic fantasy but it seemed like a fantasy of a 16 year old. Not my cup of tea...,0
"This was definitely a hot read. The heroine was likeable and nice, but the H was an overbearing jerk who veered really close to the line for me. The tension was really well crafted though.",0
"Excellent insight into early tank use, you can see the use of combined arms how armor requires the infantry in order to successfully exploit armor's power.  The last part of the book deals with the effect of modern military training on average draftees which is unique considering that the author is suggesting the techniques in use today.",0
"WOW, WHAT A STORY, FROM THE BEGINNING, UNTIL THE VERY END! I REALLY ENJOYED, READING IT!ELLIE A. MILLING, DIAMOND SPRINGS, CA.",1
"Okay so all of the reviews for this are good, really good. that's why i bought the book. I normally dont like the BDMS thing, but when they are good they tend to be great. I did not feel this way about this book. The author takes the Dom/sub relationship way too far in this book, going into ""slave"" stuff. yuck yuck yuck.So basic plot line. Abused girl flees from an abusive jerk of a boyfriend, one who beats the crap out of her. She runs to the only safe place that she has ever known, her uncle's boat, only to discover two men living in a BDMS life and they have bought her uncle's boat. One man is an ex-cop, Sully. Clarisse doesn't trust him because he is a cop and the ""master"" in the relationship. and the other man, Mac, is the submissive. This is where I start to really dislike the book. Most of the BDMS books that I have read both men are productive in some kind of fulfilling life career. Not Mac. The whole ""slave"" thing really comes into play. All Mac does is clean the house and have sex. that's it. The men bring Clarisse into their home so that she can recover, saying that she doesnt have to participate. What??? If i was invited to someone's house after having the crap kicked out of me by a boyfriend and agreed why would you tell someone about your sex life. That would make me run in the opposite direction not toward it. it was really weird. Then as she grows to love the men, the men grow fond of her. Mac tells Sully he love Clarisse but will never leave Sully for her. Sully doesnt really admit his feelings at this time.It is kind of like Mac wants a pet of his own. So Mac tells Clarisse he loves her, but it is not really a full love because he belongs to Sully and will only ever belong to him. Sully will be the one to marry her but she is not at the same rank as Mac and if it came down to a choice Mac would win. I was more then frustrated. The men want her but I never really felt like they loved her. She really struggles with the D/s thing. I felt as though the men never really cared. They want to convince Clarisse that Dom/sub life is more then it seems but if she cant except it take a hike. But when she cant they want her to stay. To say I was confused is an understatement. So Clarisse is invited to several D/s parties, she grows to understand and except the lifestyle they are in. But she still doesn't belong to the men fully. Sully says no sex until they are married. But the weird thing is Sully and Mac did it all the time before they were truly committed with one another. Clarisse agrees to marry Sully, for the life of me i dont understand. He had not said he loved her at this point in the book. She just doesnt want to be alone, away from Mac. But Mac only kind of loves her. stupid.So after all the conflict and drama in the book's surrounding plot line (with the exboyfriend) she marries Sully. She wears both his and Mac's rings on her finger. Sully wears Mac's ring and Mac wears Sully's ring. The author makes a point to tell you this because even though Clarisse loves both men both men only really claim eachother.SO after saying all of that... I was down right annoyed with this book. YUCK!!! BDMS can be good. But when you dont have an equal relationship between the partners it is crap. I really wanted Clarisse to heal and then move out of their house. Mac for the most part only calls Sully ""master"" and then when she gets sucked into their lifestyle she does the same. Sully is the only one working and making money. Clarisse is the thirdwheel in this relationship. I hated that.I have read other books by Tymber Dalton/Macy Largo and they have been good. Sunset Hearts for example is wonderful.My advice dont waste your money.",0
"The Order of the Four Sons, or O4S as the modern organization call itself, is under attack. Teams are disappearing on missions, yet events that demand their attention are on the rise in frequency and intensity. After sending out every spare group of people, even the main office's administrative staff, they bring in a misfit crew to investigate a mysterious phone call received just that day from an agent who disappeared 20 years ago from a small town called Excelsior Springs.Set in the modern day, this story is not focused on Egyptian mythology, despite the description and the intro chapter. I found this to be action-packed and interesting. The banter between the teammates is natural and often humorous. The setting in Excelsior Springs, including the history involved, is also impressive. I was surprised and pleased with the historical fiction aspects of the story, many of which involved this little town. It was clever to link a famous historical figure with O4S, though I don't want to say who the figure is due to spoilers. The old hotel and the alternate old hotel are both extremely creepy, especially due to the creatures and ghosts that inhabit them.Murphy, Bill and Kate are my favorites from the team. Murphy, the detective, is a sceptic; even after he finds himself transported to another dimension, he still refuses to believe, though he deals with what he's experiencing. Bill monitors, records and coordinates the efforts of the team as they investigate. He pops in with humorous remarks and seems to be their tether to the real world. Finally, Kate, the apprentice mage who thought she was simply coming for her first training mission, instead finds herself on a desperate mission, facing terrifying enemies.And those terrifying enemies are numerous and varied. Counted among them are ghosts, demons, immortal serial killers, and the particularly nasty spirit that spawned The Order of the Four Sons in the first place.Overall, I really enjoyed this story, particularly the historical fiction and the ongoing battle between good and evil. This is the first in a series, so the book ends off with a set up for the next one. I'd recommend this book for those who like books with interesting characters, historical tie ins, and cameos by famous (and infamous) historical figures. Others may enjoy the paranormal spin on a story set in the modern world.",1
"This is the second time I've read this book and I don't know why I thought it was only OK the first time. This time I loved it. The characters and their interaction were wonderful. It was sometimes painful, sometimes sweet, and sometimes hot. It made me cry, and it made me smile. The characters were so masterfully written that I felt everything right along with them.",1
This series has it all! This author is one of my favorites. She writes an awesome plot that keeps you on edge all the time! She can also write some sensually descriptive hot scenes between the characters!! And don't forget to read Dark Wolf Rising after you finish with this series! It's even better than these and the plot thickens! VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! AND IF YOU LIKE THESE YOU WILL LOVE THE EDGE SERIES!,1
"A cowboy, Christian Mystic struggles to survive the double curse that a family of evil sorcerers have placed upon his family while he is also struggling to save his ranch and  hind a place in his life for the girl that he loves in spite of all common sense.The writer uses alternating first person voice, and the feminine persona rings slightly off key.  Strangely enough many passages of the book have a very feminine poetic quality.  The author's plot resolution is one of the best and most unusual examples of the incorporation of Christian Mysticism, and redeems the stilted dialogue.",0
"Danny was a hoot!  Took a chance and ordered this and I stayed up and read this completely.  Found myself laughing out loud because Laney was feisty and had a conscience.  Her boss was something else (can we say ho-ho-ho?)and I have to say I was pleased when she did slap him up awake.  His family seemed a little odd, but I guess he took after his father.  Would like to know why she wasn't sure about her family meeting him.  I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from this particular author.",1
"At his son's wedding, an older guy meets a younger guy (the bride's estranged brother) and they fall in love, declaring that weekend, ""you're the only one for me and I'm gonna love you forever.""  Hmmmm....we all know this DOES NOT happen, but that's why these books are ""fiction.""  It's cute & sappy; definitely not a story with depth or a riveting plot.  Two or three sex scenes (they're not HOT or SIZZLING - just ok).  Read this when you're at the doctor's office or at the airport.  Not for your ""must read"" list.",1
Just wouldn't know what to do if we didn't have characters like these to keep our world safe. Keep up the great work Mr Shane.,1
"Umm...this book was good.  I thought it was a bit weird.  I liked the main characters.****SPOILERS****The main characters meet.  The h finds out she's pregnant.  The H doesn't believe her.  The H kicks her to the curb.  Four years later, the h has a three year old son.  The H comes back also g for the h to help h decorate a hotel he just bought.  The H blackmailed the h into having sex, then later on marrying him.  We don't find out until half way through the story that the H got a vasectomy.  Then later on, we find out that he is a carrier of cystic fibrosis.  The son doesn't have it, but at the very end the daughter is a carrier.I just thought this book was really weird.  I don't really know if I would recommend this book or not.  The whole time I was reading it, I was confused and couldn't figure out what was going on.",0
"I am committed to reviewing every book I read because, as a writer myself, I appreciate the hard work that goes into turning out a piece of work and the wish for as many reviews as is humanly possible. This novel had me in two minds. I liked the story but I lost track of who was who when characters came in and out of the tale, in a somewhat disjointed way. Having said that, the tale was intriguing and I was pleased that I didn't manage to predict the ending. I also partly agree with one reviewer in that, once we know the main character is black, there's no need to keep making references alluding to there perhaps being some special significance that we never get to the bottom of, and which has nothing whatsoever to do with the story. It could have been anyone as far as I'm concerned. I hope, for the author's sake, that I've made a fair comment.",0
"Great premise but a rich guy walking into a K-Mart type store & finding his true love.... was a bit hard to believe.  The girl was so clueless I thought she shouldn't be allow to find anyone.  Sorry but this story, which I finished hoping it would improve, read like it was written by someone who believed in HEA but really had no frame of reference for sex, relationships or how they work.  I got it for free but deleted from my KINDLE after reading, it wasn't even worth keeping.",0
This took all of 10 minutes to read and I paid for it!  It was a prelude at best.  I am sure the other reviews are from friends.,0
"Wow!  This is a fantastic young adult story that was so emotionally moving, my heart literally ached.  I cried at a few places in the story.  I could not believe that what was happening!  I got very involved with these characters and am totally on the hunt for the next part of the story.  This story has romance,  adventure, a new way of looking at Knighthood; it has everything you could want in a fantasy adventure story.This is the first story I have read by this author, and I have to say she going on my must-buy list.  She drew me into the story and kept me up way past bedtime when I should have been reading several nights in a row. Thanks so much for letting me read your book, Nicole; you gave me a real treat in this story.",1
all that down home chatter was way overthe top.this is not one of mr. nicholson's best.i found it boring and silly.,0
"I really enjoyed this second installment in this series.  I just wish it had been longer.  I would also say that I liked the fact that this one, unlike the first, had chapter demarcations, even though it's short.  Chapter demarcations make it so much easier to see how close you are to the end of a chapter or to find a stopping place when you need to do so, although that's not much of a problem on short novellas.  The characters in this series so far are very realistic in my opinion.  I think this book had just the right amount of ""bits of everything"", except being so short.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you liked the first book in the series, I think you'll like this one.  Give it a shot because I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Have at it!  I can't wait to read the third and final one.",1
"This is the third book in the Tom Caton series, and I am giving it a rest.  I have the same complaints that I had previously - wooden Kate, semi-one dimensional Caton, sophomoric love scenes, lack of tension.  This time out, since the locale was largely in China, the appealing Manchester took a back seat.  I usually don't read the book synopsis since spoilers lurk, but this time, I would have been well-served.  While human trafficking is deplorable and a reality, my interest flagged from the start.  Details followed details about the Triad, the Tong, and no suspense built at all.  I found no one to root for, no one to despise, since the characters were thrown out there with no real feeling to them.  I'm sorry to give this series a miss since there are five more....  I am usually enthralled with continuing characters and thrilled to have a long series.  Not this time.  So many like Susan Hill, Cynthia Harrod-Eagles, Alex Gray have created suspenseful stories and endearing characters who just get better and better, I had hoped for the same.  Alas, not so.  Maybe you do get what you pay for:)",0
Not the best book I've ever read  but it is completely funny this book had me rolling on floor laughing.,0
"Although this was a decent page-turner, I'm still trying to figure if it wasn't just to get to the end. Decent plot, albeit fairly predictable. I will admit, though, for a free read, it was a good way to kill a couple of hours.",0
"I do agree with another reviewer: if you aren't up on your Norse mythology, this book is hard to follow.  There are a lot of characters crammed into a small space, and there's way too much assumed knowledge on the part of the author.  That's the bad bit.So why four stars?  Because I found the interaction between the three main characters: Logan (Loki), Kir (Baldur), and Jordan to be just wonderful.  Bell is great at creating distinct characters that shine through their actions. Paranormal romance is often bogged down with melodramatic dialogue.  Bell's conversations are delightful--they are the kind of laughing interactions I have with my own friends (er, minus the sex).  Additionally, there was a great sweetness to the romance that was a treat to read.So here's my tip: if you want to really enjoy this book, read a quick primer on Norse mythology first.  It will be worth it.  I know I'll be reading up a little before the second installment.",1
I was just really bothered by the utter disgustingness and callousness of the men in this book. I think they were ALL creeps.,0
There's a lot of misspellings & it takes a while for the book to really get started. The book gets pretty good about 30% in & it has a decent ending. Its worth the read.,1
First let me say that it was a good story. My main issue was that I didn't have a good grasp of what the characters looked like. I didn't even realize they were black until I was well into the book. Which is not a problem but it left me having to make up the faces and bodies. I loved that it had a HEA.,0
"I read the reviews before getting the book and even though the majority of them warned about the 'had' issue, I still got the book. I wanted to make my own conclusions.That being said...The story is about a woman, Diona, who gets the surprise of her life when her fiancee leaves her for her sister. That sets off a chain of events that makes Diona end up in the arms of a very wealthy and powerful Greek Nikias, who has his own plans.PROS: The premise is good and the story has the potential of being very erotic and very sexy.CONS: I applaud the author for publishing a book, however, the author really needs to invest in a proofreader and editor. This book is probably a good example of why so many people do not take self-publishing authors seriously. As much as I would love to give this book a 1-star rating, I simply can't do it.Again, the potential is there for this to be a great book but lots and lots of editing need to be done first.",0
"The premise was good, the humor very good..and the romance..WHAT? Ok, I know this is a mystery..but there really is no excuse for making your main character fall in love in like 14 seconds. Honestly, that was so unbelievable it made the rest of the story hard to get into. Also, is there any point where the main character was not completely always perfectly right or on time? It's like there was no real nail-biting or clue hunting needed..since it was all conveniently contrived to plop in the main characters lap each time. Need a way for the evil character to find the hiding main characters? Make hims conveniently the BF of a biker chick who just happens to know where they are hiding. Really? That's your brilliant solution to this? Oy. The story has a lot of underlying promise..but it needs to get grittier and more Private detective-esque (IE no simple solutions and taking the easy way out of the tight plot..trust me..it will make you a better writer)",0
"Oh this was a yummy, naughty book! I'm just disappointed it was so short!  I can only imagine how great it could have been had the author taken/been given the time to write more depth to the story.  The speed (due to the short nature of the story) was hard to believe, even given their history, but it was still a great read.Very short, about 20 minutes to read, but it was still hot!  Maybe not worth $3 because it was about as short as the ones you can find free on Elloras website but still one that i will be keeping for another day!",1
"As a writer  of both homoerotica and heteroerotica, I read this story with a critical eye and, to be honest, bought it to check out my competition!  What a pleasant surprise, to read such a well-written story.  True, there are a few spots where the editing could have been a bit better (at one point the main character is lying on his back, then all of a sudden he's on his front), but these small blemishes did not take away from the beautiful language of the piece and the clever plot (and twist at the end, which I won't spoil!).  Short but sweet, and very sexy (without being just about sex).  I'll be looking for more work by Ms. Strauss in the future.",1
I guess. Didn't really get into it. To my understanding this is apart of a series don't know if I read the previous books or  if it would make a difference because most books can stand on their own or you would need to read the series to fully get into it. I was a little frustrated even though I fully read it but it's not a book I would re read again.,0
I wasn't drawn into this short story. It was strange and entirely out of my type of fiction to read.,0
"Call me shallow, but I liked it.  It was fun to see where Vadim and Sasha began, having met them in other installments of the Tri- Omega mates series.  I really enjoy seeing the big, strong warrior having a caring side for his mate.  This book does not disappoint on that account.  You also get to see how Vourdala Island got its start.",1
"Pete Toleffson is in Konigsburg, Texas because his brother Cal has finally convinced his fiance Docia to have a wedding ceremony. He's Cal's best man, but he has no idea what a best man is supposed to do, exactly. He's pretty sure he's not supposed to punch his brother, but the impulse is there every time he catches sight of Calthorpe's ever-present and perpetually satisfied grin. It's not that Pete begrudges his brother's happiness, but Pete's in a strange town full of stranger people and ragged from his job as a county attorney - a job that he tends to obsess over...to the point that he can't remember the last time he took a vacation. Staying away from his email and voicemail while he's in Konigsburg takes conscious intensive effort, and he could buy stock in the antacid company that keeps his acid reflux in check. Supporting his brother through The Wedding from hell might just be his undoing.If sheer force of will and hard work can make The Wedding go as planned, Janie Dupree's life would be a lot less complicated. Unfortunately, everything about The Wedding seems destined to a calamitous end despite all her efforts and the best man is absolutely no help. Not to mention, he's rude. Cute though. But Janie's seeing someone...sort of...even if he is boring and self-involved. And then there's The Wedding, which is taking every single ounce of self control and mental fortitude to deal with.Just when Pete is starting to relax, and starting to more than notice Janie and even step up a little in his best man role, Toleffsons start to pour into Konigsburg and it becomes painfully clear that the town is definitely not big enough for all of them. Neither Pete nor Janie would put money on surviving The Wedding intact.Since stumbling acrossVenus in Blue Jeans: Konigsburg, Texas Book 1when it was offered as a free Kindle download on Amazon.com, I've become totally addicted to the town and inhabitants of Konigsburg, Texas, and thoroughly pleased with Meg Benjamin as an author. With a smooth, crisp writing style that highlights the strength of the series - the quirky characters that populate Konigsburg - and makes the narrative flow surprisingly well with whatever crazy situations those characters find themselves, Benjamin has a gem of a series on her hands. As I was withVenus in Blue Jeans, I was surprised and impressed with just how quick and fun a read Wedding Bell Blues is, and credit the author for both the fluidity of the narrative and the charm of the characters and setting.I liked Pete and Janie - perhaps not quite as much as Cal and Docia, but still they were a pleasure to read about. I don't think Pete's character was quite as well developed in the beginning of this book as Cal's had been in his, so the evolution of Pete's character from sourpuss jerk to nice guy was a bit subtle, but I enjoyed the results all the same. The Wedding is a good foil for the book, though the insular nature of wedding preparations did slightly diminish the role of the town and townspeople as the forces of nature they were in the first book. What it provided, however, was a surprisingly realistic and occasionally tragic conflict with the Toleffson and Dupree families' dynamic.There was little smooth about that dynamic. With one brother whose wife is a vapid trollop with the maternal instinct most cobras would envy, a mother who disapproves of everything and anything, and an eldest brother with far too much bad history to forgive, Pete's family was pretty much nightmarish. I didn't much care for the mother or the sister-in-law, but thought it was great storytelling. Janie's got some conflict with her mother over the guy she's seeing and she allows herself to be a bit of a doormat in a couple of places when being nice didn't serve her very well, but I actually know people just like her so there was definitely a sense of realism to her character.As much as I wish a couple of the less than pleasant people in the book got more of a comeuppance, I appreciated the story as a whole and was thrilled to see the direction it's taking. I had a bit of an issue in the previous book with the speed with which Cal and Docia got together, and for my personal preferences, the relationship between Pete and Janie developed in a far more pleasing time frame, right up until the end. There was a massive leap in development towards the end that seemed abrupt and precipitous, but overall I enjoyed the entirety of their relationship.I thinkVenus in Blue Jeanswas a bit more quirky in both character and story, and just a touch more charming because of it, but Wedding Bell Blues was a more complex tale that provided more depth with the familial issues and in my personal opinion, was more realistic with an overall better plot. I've become a huge fan of Benjamin and this series and am looking forward to continuing withBe My Baby: Konigsburg, Texas, Book 3. I've enjoyed the Toleffsons and love the town and people of Konigsburg. I can't wait to return. 4.5 Stars.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",1

"This was my first Eden Bradley book and I was not disappointed.  The book drew me in right away with a visit to a fortune teller.  Of course the heroine doesn't want to believe the predictions even when they are knocking her down.  Enter the hero. They meet, fall in lust, fall in love, and the rest is history.  For a short read it was packed with emotion, passion, and a hint of the supernatural.  I highly recommend this book. I know I will be looking for the following books in this series.",1

As it turned out she is not compatible to breed with the lizard guys, so instead they give her to the Zorn who they have in slaved to mine their astroid/ship. The Zorn must fight and the winner gets her. Ral wins and takes her to his room caveman style where they have hot sex. Then he starts saying that she is his. &#8220;I think you don not understand. You are mine for life. I claim you. I won you. I will keep you. We will breed often and I am hoping you will take my seed to root.&#8221;It&#8217;s a very simple read, short, not very well done, and predictable. Not much world creation, but maybe in the other books it comes out. The description of sex scenes was poor, character development is nell, and I never felt a connection between Ariel and Ral. Maybe it was supposed to happen when they locked eyes at first meeting, but I felt nothing and as the book progressed I still did not feel that love connection even when they mentioned love.",0
"What's the difference between a guy and a man?  Willingness to take a risk on a relationship with a woman.  Of course, he's hot, she's hot, and the physical attraction is explosive and enjoyable.  That will earn 3 stars in this genre.  What earned the 4th star is the quality of the characterization and the interaction between the various characters in the book.The book is a quick, short read.  Just the right palate pleaser when you want a bit of romance and sex, but don't want to commit.",1
"I enjoyed this book. When I bought it, I bought  all four in the series. I will begin book II in about an hour.",1
"I rated this a 5 * based on how interesting it is and how it kept my attention..Not going into details , I would just say its from another great author that I will continue to read..",1
don't normally write reviews but think enough of this book to share. I thought the characters were all very interesting and the plot development was very unique. Not a story i've ever read before and was certainly meaningful and fast paced. Loved the ending!,1

"Kasey feels a bit frisky one evening and ends up unknowingly giving a one-woman show for her hot new neighbor. When he rushes over to make it a two-person act, certain complications arise. Will they rise to the occasion or crash and burn in their mutual lust?WHAT I LIKED:-Kasey is a lovely character who knows what she wants and stands up for it, even at the cost of losing something wonderful in return. This is a woman who isn't whiny and annoying and makes up conflict. You actually understand her view and her decision when it comes to the horrible men she dated - and the one she's facing now.- Writing was fluid, and the sex scenes were hot.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:-Hero was being a diva, making something out of nothing.-ROMANCE NOT BELIEVABLE. I get love at first sight. I also get lust at first sight. I do not get the combination of them together like an instantaneous mix. It was supposed to be a one or two-night stand and after one day together they fall in love?! That's not love, that's lazy writing. It was too easy for the characters to get their happy ending, and too hard for me as a reader to swallow.Altogether, it was a nice diversion, but immediately forgettable. Not recommended.",0
"A complete collection of works by one of the greatest storytellers of all time, Mark Twain. How could you possibly go wrong? Whether it is paddling down the Ole' Miss with Tom and Huck, or gleaning wisdom from a letter to the Poultry Raising Society, the opportunities for great laughter are endless. So grab yourself a glass of sweet tea and a pipe, find the most comfortable chair on the porch, and let Mr. Twain take you back to days gone by when there was always time for a good story.",1
"Great story and very moving. Kaya is so lonely, frightened and scared - it would be impossible not to love her character. Hunter and Jericho didn't stand a chance.I loved both stories. they were well written and well crafted. Well worth the investment.Ms. Banks is very talented.",1
"I've been meaning to come write a review for this book for awhile.  I read a lot of books that I don't bother to review, but this one stands apart.I'm not sure if I'm getting pickier as time goes on, or if there are just fewer and fewer books that are able to keep my attention.  Whatever the reason, I've been having a *really* hard time finding books that I want to bother to start reading, and even fewer that I actually bother to finish.  ""The Realm Shift"" by James Somers was a rare treat in a sea of blah.The main character is a teenager, and Somers manages to write him in a believable, likeable way (which is really saying something considering the fact that the character boasts spectacular powers-- and could easily be a shallow character).  I actually cared about what was going to happen to him.I also enjoyed the plot.  Somers does a good job at pacing and keeping the story exciting.  There's nothing worse than being engaged in a story and then the author slows the action/story down to relate mundane details (ex. describing room decorations ad nauseum, or wasting pages giving the menu for dinner).  Somehow the author is able to have an economy of words.  Enough to give you a vivid picture of what's going on, but not so much that you get bored or want to skim.He also weaves a moral good story without being cheesy, trite, or heavy-handed.To me a book is worth it, not so much based on cost, if its worth the reading hours I invested. Everyone's limited reading time is precious, and authors should not waste that time (neither should readers). Let me assure you, this book is MORE than worth it on both counts (money spent and time invested).  I'm not sure exactly what brought me to James Somers page, but I am very glad I found it, and purchased this book (and am in the middle of thoroughly enjoying the sequel ""The Order of Shaddai"").I am planning to check out many more of James Somers books and advise any readers that stumble across this review to do the same.",1
I was amazed the author could extend a simple story to such a length. You could get the whole story by reading only the first several chapters and the last a couple. The constant change of POV is very annoying.,0
"Rio is an FBI agent, a member of the Financial and Violent Crimes division (FVC). She and her parter, Eddie, are attracted to each other. And someone is threatening her life.This is the sequel to ""Broken Wings"" and, if I didn't know any better, I'd wonder if the main character was a different person. Yes, there's this blurb in the beginning saying she's been forced to forget her soul connection by the powers that be, but now she's clueless and helpless. Unfortunately, all of her coworkers at the FBI seem to be inept as well. I mean, Rio can go deep undercover to trap a mobster on a case that took years to develop, yet she and her colleagues can't handle one little stalker? And they break procedure numerous times regarding the threatening letters. Any civilian friend or relative who interrupted or threatened an undercover operation would be in big trouble, possibly arrested for interfering with police procedure, and the agent involved would be censured and maybe even fired. In her previous work you can tell the author did some background work. This thing is full of more holes than Swiss cheese.Dialogue and romantic development has also taken a serious nosedive. Propositioning the love interest by saying, ""Oh baby....Let me help you. Let me ease your pain""? Oh, please let me not read another nauseating cliche! There are several places where scene transition is rough or illogical, grammar errors are more egregious, and, to top it off, the author rewrote the main character's history. I really hope this was ghost written because otherwise it means that this was produced as a quick money-making followup to the first book and I fell for it.",0
"A competent thriller that succeeds on most levels. It's economically written, authoritative about newspaper newsrooms and statehouse journalism, and its characters are skillfully drawn (if slightly cliched; does every newsroom in fiction have an alcoholic burnout of a onetime star reporter on his last chance?).The clockspring tension and suspense is well-developed, though the moralizing about the rapacious nature of news reportage goes a bit over the top. The reveal of the killer, which offers a clever twist on real Harrisburg history (look up R. Budd Dwyer for a look at the true horror story than inspired ""Kill The Story""), leads to a delicious doozy of a climactic scene.My only real complaint, as another reviewer here aptly pointed out, is that there is no way the reader could have guessed the identity of the killer before the big reveal. That made the reveal less of a powerhouse moment then it could have and should have been, and made the ponderous exercise of piecing together the connection between the murder victims to that point into an elaborate jerk-around at the readers' expense.Also, as another reviewer pointed out, the text contained more typos and other careless errors than should ever have come from a self-respecting journalist (which the author obviously was at one time). It just goes to show that every writer needs a strong copy editor.All in all, however, ""Kill The Story"" is a reasonably well-crafted thriller that largely delivers on its intriguing premise. I'll definitely check out more of John Luciew's work.",1
"I really liked the story overall and enjoyed it, however adding say 1 more chapter to cover each of the 5 days spent at the contest would have helped bring the characters to life more, and fleshed out the story more. We could have seen more of what went on, (I know I would have enjoyed that, these are interesting characters) and gotten deeper into the story. Perhaps a little more of Margo playing hard to get, drawing out the romance and seduction.For a longer story I would definitely add another star.The author is definitely talented.",0
This book didn't interest me at all... I felt like it was torture to read to the end. Nit crazy about this era I guess.,0
I love the works by Mark Twain because he was an interesting man.I visited his house in Hartford Conn. where he wrote many of his stories Love it!,1
"From what I understand, this is Mari Carr's first published piece and frankly, it kind of reads that way. I liked the two main characters and enjoyed their connection, plus there were some places with decent chemistry and sizzle. Overall though, it all felt very inconsistent. At some points Ross seems very alpha, at others we're told he's alpha but really see no evidence of that.The beginning of their sexual relationship felt a little awkward, with them running hot and cold and bouncing around back and forth on what they understand their relationship to be. The whole thing felt choppy, the love scenes short, jumping from one to another, then skipping a few days, etc. There were only a few lines in each scene that started to make me feel hot and bothered, and then it would sizzle away. It sometimes seemed like the ingredients were there, but for some reason they didn't come together as they should and it ended up feeling ... flat.One *HUGE* complaint I have: They start off almost at the beginning with role-playing - and role-playing in which Julia is a captive or sex slave, i.e. she's supposed to be somewhat resisting. While resistance is not a big part of the role-playing, it's still present, so I found it extremely disturbing that there was no safe word and they didn't lay down any rules or understandings beforehand.As I said before, I liked Julia and Ross and really enjoyed their friendship and the dialogue back-and-forth between them. I think the story could have turned out far better if that part had been more heavily explored and the sexual component of their relationship slowly integrated in. A really fantastic example of this that I read recently was Claire Matthews'Intimate Friends. That novella is even shorter, so the length constraint is greater and they start sleeping together pretty early on, however it felt much smoother and worked far better than in this case.ROMANCE NOVELLA RECOMMENDATIONS:*Intimate Friendsby Claire Matthews (4.5 stars)*Hearts In Darknessby Laura Kaye (4.5 stars)*Willing Victimby Cara McKenna (4 stars)",0

"While agreeing with Avid Reader that this is a Vegan polemic posing as science fiction, I would disagree about his calling it ""liberal"".  Very few liberals are Vegan, and in my experience very few Vegans have much in the way of politics, liberal or conservative, beyond ""eat Vegan"". I'll be willing to agree with Avid Reader if he or she can name for me one liberal presidential candidate who didn't eat barbecue in Texas or brats in Wisconsin...Two stars for the attempt, but don't waste your time on this.Now, if someone would write a book about a Vegan-turned-zombie and what she does when the only thing she an stomach are brains...  That might be worth reading. ""Vegan gets Brains"", by...",0
"This book has moments where I am briefly interested, but then it loses me just a few pages later. The author means to be mysterious, but the writing just crosses the line into confusing and boring. There is too little detail, and too little action to keep me hooked. I am halfway through the book, and I give up. I will not finish it.",0
"From the moment he met him, Gregory knew Ryland was his mate, but when they met Ryland was much to young to claim. Six years later Gregory finally makes Ryland his only to learn he may lose him.  To Gregory, Ryland has always been special, but he discovers what sets Ryland apart from the other wolves in their pack may be the very same thing that kills him.Ryland didn't understand all of the ramifications of being a tri-omega, all he knew was that he loved Gregory and wanted nothing more than to have Gregory claim him.  Being claimed by Gregory was everything Ryland dreamed it to be, but his dream may come to an end when he and Gregory discover that their happily ever after depends on someone they never met.Forbidden Desires was a good follow up book in the Tri-Omega Mates series.  I loved Ryland from the previous book and adored him even more in Forbidden Desires.  I wasn't crazy about some of the secondary characters but Ryland, Gregory and Viktor, the man who completed their relationship, made Forbidden Desires a very enjoyable read.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"I would like to cut to the chase and say this book was extremely good.  What a way to start off my kindle reading.  My husband recently suprise me with a kindle and this was the first book I downloaded and read.  And may I just say what a great first.  I am no stranger to interracial romance novels I have been reading them since forever, but this one was a scorcher.  I loved to hate Nicolas and I loved to love Laney.  I even like the pain in the butt Cooper. To Tiffany Ashley it would be great to read a sequel involving Cooper. Reading this book was easy and yes there was some graphic language but its not like I didnt expect it, Although when I was reading I changed the really graphic lady parts words.  But we are all adults and know what the words mean.  Good book, good characters. Please write a sequel with Cooper!:) Keedah",1

"It's THREE PAGES LONG...Okay, it's more than three pages, but not by much. I downloaded this for free from Amazon for my Kindle. I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention to the reviews on Amazon, I won't be purchasing any more romantic ""freebies"" unless I pay attention to what I'm really going to be getting which is a very short PART of a short novel.On another note, this story was forgettable for me. I am glad I didn't waste my money.",0
I have had this series in my kindle for awhile and finally decided to give it a read. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is pretty good so far. The characters are so realistic that it makes them easy to read and imagine the scenes in the story. I definitely recommend this series. Now onto the next in the series.,1

"I was looking forward to reading it, but when I started to look for dialogue and the story to take off....well, it was a bust. Sorry to say but when there's only what's supposed to be figured out as ""dialogue"" I was left stopping and trying to fugue out what was going on. Stopped reading after the first few pages.",0
"Really enjoyable book. I read it for the story not to edit the typos, I don't notice little things like that if I like the book. I could have used less of the intimate sections and more of the conflict between creator and fledgling. I was teary reading the reunion of family members. It gets an A from me.",1
"La Malinche is also known as Dona Marina, the native woman who aided Hernan Cortes in his conquest of Mexico.  I knew quite a bit about that history, and when I know something of the subject, I'm afraid that the author will mess it up.  I didn't have to worry.  Mr. Hepple knows his subject very well.Treasure is more than an historical novel.  Mr. Hepple blends present day Mexico with the past, as well as using a ""Talk Radio"" show to present other information from outside sources in a very entertaining way.I spent half my time sitting on the edge of my seat, biting my fingernails or holding my breath.  The other half was spent in fascination with the history and politics of Mexico or laughing at Linc's problems with women (Vol. 2).As I was getting toward the end, I thought I would take a break and read something else before reading Vol. 2.  No such luck.  It was not to be.  Vol. 1 ended with breath-taking cliffhanger and I immediately started reading Vol. 2I highly recommend this book.",1
This is unreadable. The formatting makes this so difficult to read not to mention the lack of voice from the characters. It was so bad that I barely made it to chapter three. Even though this is free don't waste your time.,0

"The title for my review pretty much covers how I feel about this book. It's a good thing it was free because I'd be upset even to spend $0.99 on this. The main guy is completely nuts. He hates the Queen and then after having sex with her decides he loves her? We are constantly told about some magical amulet that protects her, yeah I get it the amulet protects her...no need to mention it in every other sentence. I feel like I wasted 20 minutes of my life that I will never get back. SKIP THIS, you aren't missing anything.",0
"Its basically pornography without personality. Lots of things happen, there is history, there is a bunch of sexy bits but I ended up not caring for the characters.On the positive side, the world is clearly developed. The author put a lot of thought on the rules that govern this world. Sadly the book revels in explaining it to the point where I just skipped most of it to get to the action.The characters also have a lot of history, but history doesn't always equal personality. I had trouble feeling for any of them in any way.The sexy bits were sexy, of course, nothing exceptional but by no means bad.I could tell that a bunch of work went into making this book which is why I couldn't give it a 1 rating but I can't give it a high one either because I just wasn't satisfied. I am curious about the second installment though. I don't know if I would buy it or wait till it's on sale (I got this one for free), but I'll definitely sample it.2 stars but only because it felt like there was effort put in it, as opposed to mindless writing that some other erotica have.",0

"And I do mean WHOA!  This started off great and went downhill fast after the party.  One thing I really can't stand is when a man calls the woman he is suppose to care about derogatory names (bitch, slut, and whore).  What was worst was when he had her to call herself those names.  Of course the female was a strong woman with a submissive side, but this went to far IMO.  It really reminded me of today's younger generation where the male teen calls the female bitch and she answers.  Victor was cold, mean,and abusive and when he thought the welts were beautiful from his caning...she should have told him take a picture bc it won't be happening again and the same with the hot wax.  It came across to me as though he was learning the lifestyle, bc he would forget to take care of her.  She was attracted to him and wanted someone to dominate her sexually and he just wanted someone to abuse.  Victor made out like a bandit in this one and I couldn't picture this relationship getting better.",0
"I have read reviews that are really quite harsh with this book but perhaps in some ways justified.  It is a little different to the wolves and kings certainly and perhaps even a little slow, and often almost convoluted.  It is also fresh and has some fascinating characters notwithstanding Drake and Raven.  They are both strong and bold, and Raven is spellbinding with her diverse personalities, and those in the background already tempting us with intrigue.  Once I got my head around a totally different world I found myself hooked. I say great reading and can't wait to read the next one but the choice is yours.",1

"This book is dreadful. The writing is stilted, awkward, and consistently ungrammatical; the characters have no inner lives and precious little in the way of outer lives; the plot is full of holes and random events; the historical context is woefully misrepresented; and the story is pretty damn unpleasant. And I experienced all this before abandoning the book a quarter of the way through.  I have seldom been more repulsed by a ""romance"" novel.  Ugh.",0
I found this book really boring. Not much went into the writing of this book. The only good thing was that it was short.,0
"So my rating is not necessarily Ms. Hewson's fault.  I'm not one for jump around type reading.  I was reading this ""short story"" in bed before I went off to sleep.  I had not paid particular attention before starting to read that is was not a short story, but part story, part prose, etc.This was a jumble of feelings from when she was a young girl, then as a young adult and goes on to poems.  It was hard for me to follow.  None of which written had anything to do with the Mormon church really.I ""purchased"" this book for free.  I'm really glad I didn't even spend $.99 on it!",0
"I didn't enjoy this book.  I read it all of the way through and it ended worse than it began.There were too many ""main characters"" to begin with.  The reader was given glimpses of each in their little ""flashback moments,"" but there was not enough to like any of them.  As others have noted, most of the characters came off as jerks--self centered jerks to be exact.  Because there were so many ""main characters"" each one's ""romance"" was given no time at all.  Seriously, I would definitely prefer one GOOD romance than 4 rushed jobs.  When you try to mish mash 4 romances together like this the characters are lost and the plot ceases to exist.This is billed as an ""Irish Romance,"" and I can only assume that is because everyone speaks like a bloody Irishman--despite the fact that only 2 of the characters are from Ireland.  If the author wants to make most of the characters American, then bloody well learn how they talk. The editing was poor but that takes a backseat to the lack of a plot and poorly developed and unlikeable characters.",0
This book was very good. I enjoyed the characters and the story line I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. I recommend this book to everyone.,1

I was pissed to say the least, you make money from writing, but your ripping off your customer's with this mess! I'll just leave it at that!",0
"This collection of short stories contains five short mystery/revenge tales and a preview of another full novel from the author.  The first story shares the title of the collection and focuses on two detectives having lunch while discussing a current case.  It's a good start to the collection as it's well-written, well-paced, and has a satisfying end result.  Following that, however, are stories which go a bit down hill in quality.  The next two stories (""The Hoosegow Strangler"" and ""Trail of the Lonesome Stickpin"") feature the author's Old West husband/wife duo of Mick and Casey.  They both read as young adult fiction, which contrasts starkly with the first story in the collection, and don't really do a good job of introducing the characters or making the reader care about them.  The second of these (Lonesome Stickpin) is a bit of a mess in terms of pacing and narration -- there are parts of the story that are simply difficult to follow and the storyline isn't interesting enough to justify re-reading sections to follow the specifics.  While the first three stories are more closely aligned with the mystery genre, the final two are tales of revenge.  The fourth story (""Alibi"") makes another stark transition to a modern tale of a planned homicide.  Although somewhat interesting, it's a very quick tale that likely could have been better fleshed out.  The final story (""The Promise"") transitions back to the Old West and features a story about a dysfunctional family.  Overall, i would give it two stars.  The major upside is the quality of the first story.  The collection was freebie when I got it and was worth downloading for the title story -- the rest could be easily skipped.",0

Her ex shows up, she is part of the floor show, and much much more.  Her ex wants her back, but not for the reason you might think.  This is about another 40 pages, but the story could go further if the author decides to contiune the story.  This is the weakest in the series, but it still gets 3 stars.",0
"Thank heavens there is a dictionary feature in Kindle!  The antiquated language was ponderous as was the unnecessary prosaic verbiage with details beyond all reason.  I found them charming, but I would never read any more of them.  They are an acquired taste.  If you don't love old English novels, don't bother.  If you like Doyle & Christie, you'll probably find them interesting.  For the price, they are a bargain.",0
These are very thought out and well written books. A good balance of action and romance. I will be looking into this authors other books.,1
"Enjoyed the story! Loved the characters! The story was a little choppy, but still a great story line! Worth the money to buy it and I would recommend!",1
I thought with all the positive reviews I would love this book.  Not! This book is horrible it starts fast (literally she is in love with one man in the morning and in love with another by the evening) and the premise of indecent proposal wasn't even done well.  The heroine I'm sorry I found her stupid and greedy.  She was the worst that you would think of someone from the country just ignorant she made us look bad.  So glad I haven't  spent the $5.99 a piece for the other two books in the series maybe if the price goes down.  I just don't see a billionaire being so enamored by a Black Country chick with no education and obviously no common sense that he will do anything to get her even offer her and her fianc&eacute; a million bucks.  Sorry for the spoilers but I found myself disgusted with Daisy and her treatment of Pete.  For those that love Aiden and Daisy together so much especially based on this book they deserve each other two crazy people together.  She was so in love with Pete and ready to marry him the next day until someone dangles a million dollars in your face and all you can think about is not your future happiness with the man you love but what you can do with the money.  Maybe she buys some self respect and common sense in the other books.  I am just so disappointed I really wanted to like this.  There is not explanation or build up to why Aiden like/loves Daisy so much.  I also just couldn't get past Daisy the only character I did like was Pete he was genuine and as a character I felt he was the most developed.  Daisy was who she was but in relation to Aiden I just didn't get that his character was developed enough to justify his like/lust/love for her.,0
i'M SORRY I'M LATE WITH REVIEW . I THOUGHT I SENT ONE. THE BOOK WAS VERY GOOD .THANK YOU MUCH.,1
"I enjoyed this book more than the first because there was less of the ""Lord of the Rings""-stuff.  This could have been another good war srory.  Pity that I still don't know what a delver is supposed to be (maybe human on steroids, or so it seems).  Also, lots of references to incidents in the first book which makes reading that one essential.",1
"I bought this book after seeing the movie. I loved the movie, so buying this book when I came across it was a no-brainer for me. The book is just as good as the movie, leaving the reader on the edge of their seat, wanting more.",1
"I won't lie, the first few chapters are hard to get into....or at least it was for me. But by the time I got to chapter 4 I was so riveted that I couldn't put the book down. It sort of boggled my mind to know that any woman could ever forgive a husband that had married her, when he already had a family two states away. And what's even worse... then she moves to that same city where the other family lives, so her children can still be close to their dad. I have to tell you...that just blew my mind. Then it gets better yet, because this woman's brother is the one that ratted him out, and now her own brother is married to her ex-husband's, Kevin's, first wife. And what's even more weird, is that both of his ex-wives become best friends in the process. In fact they all seem to get along, both the children and the adults. I still really don't know how she did it, but....the Brenda Novak had a way of weaving this story around so well, that it really makes this story work some how.Like I said...there are so many major twists and turns in this story, that by the time I finished reading it, I thought I'd surely have a bad case of whiplash. LOL!Stories that involve adultery usually isn't my kind of thing, but this story really hooked me for some odd reason.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!! Most definitely.",1
Gandhi always been a guiding light to many not only for his generation but also for us and for our future ones. The decisions taken by him as to why he did what he did was very clear from this book.  There are lots of things that we need to learn from him and this is a book of guidance to many of us.,0

"A suspenseful story with scientific and religious implications. A secret society employs sinister motives in their efforts to bring to life a second Christ through cloning. A very enjoyable story, it was a fast read for me because of the suspense. I'd recommend it.",1
Really a typical story.  Probably a three star only due to the characters.  Actually a bit boring.  Hope next book is better,0
"A clever and well written short story. Done even better then the Masters of Horror that used a similar theme.  What happens if a killer who picks up hitchhikers meets a killer hitchhiker?  Each killer in this story is written by one of the two writers.They don't see what the other one wrote until they finally bring it together. A great way to really shock and take the reader for a ride. If the writer doesn't know whats happening no way the reader can.When two remorseless killers do try and one up each other, who do you root for? Who's way of killing wins out? Two is always better then one and this story really delivers the goods. No dead parts or boring filler, just out the gate goodness.I am VERY much looking forward to reading many more books by these guys.Brandon",1
"This was a free kindle book that I got a couple of months ago. When I read the product description it didn't seemed like something I would like.  But I love to read different authors and genres, and I ended up surprised.  Don't normally like things that are in this setting - planets and space.  However, the setting doesn't impact the story at all - the only real mention is when they are traveling.The heroine, Aidan, is a pilot trying to help her degenerate brother, an addicted gambler. The hero, Warwick, is an enforcer with only vengeance keeping him going.The author set the two characters up well and the romance between them was well written.  This short story is a great jumping off point - I am looking forward to other installments in this series.  I am glad I took a chance and downloaded this book while it was free - otherwise I would have pass up a good read.",0
"As I was reading this book, I couldn't help but think that if ""I Love Lucy"" were x-rated this would be a perfect episode:  Lucy on a roadtrip where all sorts of unexpected disasters befall her. The problem for me is that I've never liked Lucy. Humor based on the thinnest of plots, stupidity and amazing coincidences just isn't my cup of tea. Add in characters who are cardboard cut-outs and a boatload of unmotivated sex (you know, lust at first sight and every sight thereafter, like animals in heat) and I'm really sorry I spent any time or money on this book.",0

"Characters:  Atlas, the Titan god of strength and Nike the Greek goddess of strength.  Both make mistakes while in charge of the other in the prison system, but can't help falling in love.  Both are very likeable characters, but have NOTHING to do with the Lords of the Underworld series and should be considered a novella set in the same world.Writing Style: This one is so different than the Lords' books and has NOTHING to do with them other than mentioning the Lords in passing.  It is not a necessary book in the series and I feel like it should be a free novella.Plot: Atlas is the Titan god of strength and Nike is the Greek goddess of strength.  They make a great pair except that one or the other is imprisoned.  Nike is extremely mean and taunting to Atlas after he seduces her into believing he loves her enough to help him escape.  She finds he has seduces all the other women jailors, so she brands him with her name across his chest.  Neither can forget the great chemistry (sex) they have had, but they also can't forgive each other.  When Cronus overthrows the Greet gods and imprisons them, it is Atlas's turn to mark Nike with his own name, but he finds that he feels possessive of her once he has marked her. Now he wants her to be freeRomance: Disappointingly, it is so short that only one romantic scene is included.

What would you do if several years down the road you run into someone who meant the world to you and hurt you? Alanna was dumped by Leon and turned around and married his brother. She was pregnant with Leon's child at the time. This is a short story of what happens when he see's her again. It was very complete even as a novella in the telling. I have read several Julia James stories and still enjoy rereading them.,1
"I started reading and got bored so I went on and read something else, thinking I would give it another go I realized I was reading the same thing over, I thought my kids had gone back a few pages but no. This woman went on and on about the same things, I didn't find any of it funny, I only heard sarcasm. I also thought it was in poor taste to write about her ex who committed suicide. I would not recommend this book to anyone and am annoyed that I wasted my precious time on it.",0
"Maisy tries to be a good Christian girl but says things she shouldn't and winds up pregnant by a gay friend.Perfectly horrible book, with no similarities to actually trying to live a Christian life.

"I really like the stories I have read by this author, but this was my least favorite so far.  I usually really like this author and was disappointed by the book because it was just okay.  They story had a very interesting premise, but it was not fleshed out into the full story it deserved.  The shortness of the story makes Aislinn's capitulation a little too quick even though you know they have been working together for 6 months already. I would love to see this story worked out into a full novel by this author and see where it really goes.  It felt overly edited to fit within a certain number of pages.I will keep reading her books, but I just won't revisit this one.",0
"As I read this, I found myself trying to guess where the twists were, what was real and what was just plain paranoid.  I liked the story well enough and the writing got the job done.I'd say for a leisure read, it's worth picking up.",1

"I enjoy the Wall Street Journal, but being a daily publication, I wanted more up-to-date news breaks.  The NY Times Blog solves the issue.It pumps news stories to the Kindle every 3-4 hours, and the stories appear to be comprehensive, well-written, each about 1000 words long, and there are approximately 8-12 headlines active at a time.  So, it is not the NY Times newspaper itself regarding content amount, but getting thousands of words of up to date info effortlessly every few hours, 24/7, is well worth the $1.99 monthly. The stories are more timely than even the NY Times subscription newspaper.I have used the experimental web feature of the Kindle to secure news stories, and while that works also, it is more cumbersome, slower, takes more clicks of the wheel, and it not a neat and tidy as having active headlines 24/7 ""pushed"" to the device.I did the trial subscription to Reuters headlines and found it far inferior to the NY Times Headlines for content, photos, navigability, and writing quality.  Try both the Times and the Reuters and the difference will stun you.The NY Times blog even has photos for almost every article that are good quality, and is easy to navigate and read.  Highly recommended.",1
"First this is an excellent kindle edition as it is true to the original and contains no scanning errors also it contains copies of the original artwork which can be zoomed to view in addition there is a glossary which contains words or phrases that may not be familiar and I found myself using the links which were underlined. Also included in the book complete with photographs is a comprehensive biography of L Ron Hubbard.The actual story is typical of the type written at the time when authors had to bash out stories in minimal time to meet editor's time scales and often paid by the word.  I have now read 4 of these books and previously thought that the ""Iron Duke"" was the weakest however I do not think this one is as good. It is a very short story probably best described as fantasy; from the cover picture I thought it was going to be a ""spaceship"" type science fiction. The story centres around a professor who discovers a formula which when allows him to instantly teleport to any destination that he thinks about or is even suggested by someone else but with little control of destination and that is about it  .Worth reading if only to get a flavour of this type of book.",0
"I was fairly surprised at the level of raunchiness in this one. Maybe I should have read the reviews, because the synopsis is misleading. This book goes beyond kinky.

"i wanted to like this book since i enjoyed book 1. but there were just too many issues. things that would be brought up but then never resolved or mentioned again. storyline that fell short. horrible grammer ( missing letters, misspelled words, missing words). And i cant help but take offence to the authors way of handling the rape issue. she is attacked and basically raped, leaving behing vaginal bruising and internal/external scatching. then 12 hours later demanding that her lover have sex with her or she'll get it from her ex. so they not only have sex but rough sex. sorry, i wish i could let that go but i cant. its just wrong and offensive.also no continuity. one paragraph would contradict another. small example: femal statesthat one night her and her roomate/soon to be exlover watch tv before going to bed. the later it is questioned why she doesnt have a tv. huh?? too many things like this through out. just coudnt like the book.",0

I did not expect to learn anything from it.I was wrong.If I were still teaching writing, I would make this required reading for all of my students who were serious about wanting to be published.

First book in Halle Puma Series. Loved it.  Have read the whole series 3 times.  That is how much I love this series.

Great book~ it's about lost loves that reconnect. Hot sex scenes ~ even a threesome which it hot hot hot!

When Riley is released from prison on a technicality, he's hellbent on finishing the job once and for all. Lucas tries to live some semblance of a life, opening his own bookstore, but he's haunted by scars, both emotional and physical, which prevents him from trusting others and allowing them to get close. Nicholas Demetris has been in love with Lucas for five years and is determined to prove that they would be great together. As Lucas and Nicholas struggle with their feelings for one another, a more dangerous and deadly threat is on the horizon.I enjoyed this short story, which was a very quick read.

The love story between Lucas and Nicholas was sweet and I admired Nicholas for never giving up on Lucas or his love for him.",1
I already wrote a review for this and don't think I need to send another one in on why I didn't like it,0
"I picked this up as a free download and, to my surprise, I read it straight through. The characters are well-differentiated and the incidents are captivating. This is teen fiction, but it held my attention all the way through.Obviously the negative reviewers were expecting more. For them I suggest Henry James.Surviving the Fog is very close to Swiss Family Robinson and it's a fun read in the same way. True, there's no plot, just a sequence of incidents. Yes, female characters seem to be cardboard stage props. Yes, the last quarter of the book wanders. Yes, it could use more proofing -- although I only noticed 3 errors. But if you accept the book for what it is, it succeeds quite well. I'll definitely try some of Morris's other books.",1

"JT Summers was in trouble.  He lusted after his friends little sister, and he was not happy about it at all.  He was supposed to be her protector, but who would save Nikki Durant from him?  He knew that she wanted him just like she knew he was equally affected.  When Nikki got herself arrested just to be near him, and JT resisted her once again, she pulled out all stops and went to her friend Jasmine for help.When JT arrived at Sweetwater Ranch to take Jasmine up on the swim she invited him for, he was horrified to find Nikki sunbathing in the nude.  He knew at that moment he had been had. After a very erotic encounter, JT couldn't get Nikki out of his mind.  When she showed up at his office during a rainstorm, and started stripping in his office, he knew he was in deep.  There was no way he could resist her, and he didn't even try.  It wasn't until after their first encounter that he realized he had taken her virginity, and he had all but called her an easy whore.JT didn't know if they even had a name for how badly he had screwed up.  Nikki had saved herself for him, and he had treated her horribly.  He had tried to see her, but Jasmine, Seth, and Zane had prevented him from getting anywhere near her.  He knew he was late in figuring it out, but he was in love with her, and was going to win her back.Another winner by MB!!  I like Nikki.  She is brash, sassy, and goes after what she wants at full steam.  No half way with her.  JT was fighting himself.  He loves Nikki, but is overwhelmed with obligation, and promises made to her brother.  JT promised to protect her in her brother's absence, but was loving her instead.  Great read!!",1

"I was rather disappointed in this book. The writing--as far as vivid descriptions and sentence structure--was okay. The over all plot wasn't really that bad either. The problem was that it was set in the early 1800s, yet the vocabulary used (mainly referring to that for body parts and sex acts) didn't fit the century at all - way too modern. Why bother to research and use proper dialect and setting descriptors/situations elsewhere only to jolt the reader back to the 21st century with modern vernacular?  As far as I'm concerned, this book was a spaghetti bowl of sex tossed on top of a shaky frame of a plot by and author who could decide which century she was in.",0

Absolutely nothing is wrong with him, despite the fact that he has apparently held a torch for a girl he hardly interacted with since he was in eight grade (creeper alert).True love is great, but this was just so difficult to buy.

Andrews, with Serengeti Heat reminded me that not just the Canidae family can be in possession of hot Alphas.REVIEW: Ava Minor is the runt of the pride. The smallest, the slowest and the oddest looking {in her lion form} she really has no hope to get a man, or to have cubs of her own. On a mission to ""get some"" even if it is from a human in a random pick-up bar, Ava saunters into the local dive and sidles up to the best looking cowboy in the place. Her mission is just about accomplished when she senses her Alpha standing right behind her...""oops.""Resigned to being forced back to the ranch and lorded over by her four over-protective brothers - Ava would never expect that Alpha Landon would actually be hot for her and they would end up hooking up in her driveway. But as she begins to realize that it is probably just because she is in heat her fantasies about hooking the Alpha deteriorate. Well, at least she can have him for one night. That should be enough, right?Short and entertaining, Serengeti Heat was another great bit of PNR to come out of Samhain Publishing. The characters were charming and the setting was interesting. I definitely look forward to reading more from Vivi Andrews. My only negative regarding the book was that it wrapped up too nicely, but this is probably because of the word limit Samhain gives to these anthology novellas. I really expected a bit of back-lash from a few of the not-so-nice characters. ""Meow"" cat fight. Oh well.This is short read, and a very cheap listing, on amazon.com for $2.80 here. I love a good book deal! RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, a lot of happy coupling. PNR fans, shifter fans should enjoy.

"Perhaps if the Accidental Countess had a different heroine, I might have liked this book.  The story line was interesting and the hero was imminently likable.When Stephen Chesterfield, the Earl of Whitmore awakens he is finds himself injured, with no memories of the last few months and married to his childhood sweetheart, Emily.  He is frankly stunned and disbelieving that they are married as he has no memory of their wedding.Emily has not seen her husband in months, he left very soon after their wedding and she is holding a major grudge and accuses him of all kinds of misdeeds.  She seems to truly dislike her husband and it is apparent to the reader she wants Stephen to remain her husband so he can protect and provide for her and her deceased brother&#8217;s children.Stephen&#8217;s memory does not return easily and Emily seems to resent him for it.  She is irrationally angry that Stephen cannot remember their wedding night.  This is just plainly ridiculous.  She is quick to believe the very worst about him.Stephen sets out to discover the missing pieces of his memory and it becomes apparent that someone wants him dead.  Even when the first attempt is made on his life, Emily displays little reaction.  I found her to be unemotional with Stephen unless she was angry.Later she begins to thaw toward the hero, but her earlier action and her inability to trust the hero had already cemented my view of her as an illogical (she never made any inquiries to her husband&#8217;s whereabouts while he was gone for months), self-serving heroine.",0
"I was hoping this novel would be okay for a romance, however the heroine is a wimpy idiot who won't tell the hero about her so-called past (her parents are rich and trying to make her marry a man she doesn't even like) until it is almost too late. She is supposed to be feisty with attitude, which doesn't appear to be the case as the story gets going. The hero could do a lot better for himself, IMO.The parents of this twit take her money from her but how I am not sure, because the reader is told that it is in the heroine's name, and she is still driving her sports car at the end of the book.The sex goes on for page after boring page - I am not sure why modern romance novels have to have such long sessions of graphic sex. Don't they realise that less is frequently more? Or is it to fill up the pages to make up the word count because the plot can't do it?The novel could do with some urgent editing.

"Jolene Benate should be on top of the world.  She had a very coveted spot on the warrant squad, and was the only female team member.  She was damn good at her job, and everyone knew it.  There was only one thing missing from her existence, and that was a personal life, and love.  Her one true love had been stripped away from her six long years ago, and to this day she still felt the acute pain of losing her husband Paul Benate.  Jo knew she should try to move on; give her heart a push to meet someone new, but she just couldn't do it.Paul wasn't dead as everyone assumed he was.  He had cut Jolene out of his life because he was working on classified projects, and he was terrified that someone would use her to get to him, so he had taken that possibility away.  He did keep tabs on his beautiful wife, and knew she hadn't moved on with someone else just the same as he hadn't.  When he could stand it no longer, he decided to have her brought to the current military complex he was working in.  Someone trying to get to him had shot her, and it was time he started protecting what was his.Jolene was abducted from her protection detail, and was being shipped to someone.  She had no idea what was going on, but decided that keeping a cool head would be her best line of defense.  She had to pay attention, so she could find an opportunity to escape.  Nothing could have shocked her more than coming face to face with the husband she had mourned for years.  She almost lost it, but reigned herself in, and took the only course of action she could at the moment.  Jo resorted to violence, and punched the husband she thought was lost.Paul is a man that was forced to live with a decision he wished with his soul he could change.  He knew he never should have given up his heart's desire in favor of what he wanted to accomplish professionally.  Jolene had existed without Paul for years, but never recovered from his loss.  As these two lost lovers try to rekindle the love, and loss of trust, outside enemies try to separate them forever.  This is a pretty good story, but in several spots it slows to a crawl, and is even boring at times.  Overall it is an interesting read, but not a keeper.",0
"Man, what a load this one is. Let's see, a 35 year old virgin goes to a board meeting and for the most part is either raped by the members of the board or coerced through bondage to have sex (of some kind) with each of them.  So! What's not to like, huh?  My God, is this what women of today aspire to?  Do you actually enjoy reading about a woman trussed up like a cow at a rodeo who is then experimented on by guys with different fetishes? This woman doesn't know she is about to become the center of attention, so to speak, and is certainly not happy with her forced entry into BDSM, yet our wonderful story teller continues with her tale.Matt, the CEO, has rigged up a machine which suspends a woman while fully restraining her at the same time.  With this fantastic device, which just happens to be installed in the board room, he can show our female protagonist just how much he and his fellow board members ""love"" her.I am appalled that the author would have you believe the average woman on the streets would enjoy this type of depravity and would, in fact, state her undying love for her antagonist.  The book has errors and omissions, but the real problem with this type of nonsense is that it gives the impression that if you are a large, dominant, sexually attractive male you can do what you want with a woman and, no matter how weird it is, they will love you for it.  GIVE ME STRENGTH!!!  Look, what you do in the bedroom with your spouse or lover is your business, and if you want to beat each other senseless while having consensual sex, Okay.  Just remember, coerced sex isn't consensual sex; it's rape.  Just because this book is fiction doesn't excuse its implications.  Honey!  Where's my two-by-four???

"Wow, where to begin. I've found some excellent Kindle cookbooks (of all types) in the past few months but this isn't one of them.First off, the formatting in this eBook is so, SO bad!!! The photos are laughable. And of what...not just poor, grainy images of the recipes themselves, but ones showing someone pouring oil in a pan, cutting a piece off a hunk of cheese, a used knife on a cutting board...the list goes on and on. Filler with no reason for being there. If someone is this ""challenged"" in the kitchen that they need images like these to be included, I think you'd better be staying away from knives and the stove. ;&lt;)The recipes for the most part are just a bunch of ingredients thrown together in a pot and heated up. No real thought or work put in when it comes to proper seasonings, optimal preparation, etc.One recipe I noted for Veggie Mexican Lasagna suggested beef/chicken/turkey as options. News flash: these are animal products, not vegetarian!These might be easy recipes but tasty and memorable...NOT. Keep looking. There are much better choices to be had for vegetarian cookbooks.",0

"Amy Parker had only room for one love in her life, and that was work.  She was a junior partner at the law firm she worked for, but her goal was to make senior partner by the end of the year.  Always known for iron control in all situations, everyone would be so surprised to find out the secret longing she harbored for her subordinate Justin Garrett.  They were in Maui to get a deal hammered out before Christmas.  Little did Amy realize, but Justin knew about her innermost fantasies as he had inadvertently opened her personal email, and read all about them in her conversations with her best friend Gloria.  He planned to stake his claim to her this trip, and be the master of her body from now on.  Amy was a different person in Hawaii.  She was relaxed and free.  Justin liked this Amy, but he knew also the problems they were facing, and the roadblocks she would throw in their path.  They were competitive colleagues, and he was younger than she was.  He didn't care about any of it, but knew that Amy would be over thinking this to death.  Justin decided he would be the one to give Amy the life she deserved, as well as the best Christmas present he, and their client Mitch Magruder could possibly give her.This was a very sensual and sexy Christmas short story.  Justin is a no nonsense laid back kind of guy while Amy is the ice queen, and always in complete control.  He shakes her up, and makes her want things she thought she could never have.",1
"Manhunting in MS is an enchanting little romance novel with 1 sizzling love scene, a touch of comedy and it's offered at an excellent price.  Although the overall the plot is rather ordinary, it was still interesting and believeable.  I enjoyed it. I really liked the chemistry between the main characters.",1
This was an exciting and riveting story. The Romane  was there and the story ended as much as I could ever have thought.,1

"This was a short and sweet fairy tale romance.Fiona fell in love with Garret. After she moved in with him, he changed. He started slapping her, and hurting her. She waited for him to leave for work one day, and climbed into her old car and headed for Texas from Colorado. During her trip she swerved to miss hitting a dog, then she passed out. Aidan stopped to help her. He realized her car was about to break down. So he offered her a ride to his home, a job, and a place to stay for a little while. They thought it would be better if they pretended to be a couple. While they were pretending, they both fell in love with one another. Meanwhile her ex was still harassing her, and threatening her. The suspense of the story was Garret finding her. I was glad Aidan was there to give her support, and his love. The chemistry seemed between Fiona and Aidan seemed real, but the time line was too fast for it to happen in real life. It did make for a nice fairy tale.",1

"Let's see first off this book was so bad I couldn't even get through it, I'm at 63% and I can't bring myself to waste anymore of my time on it. With that being said here's what I can tell you about what I have read--there's no character development, Ral all but rapes Ariel in the first chapter, he's not really a sexy leading man with his razor sharp teeth which kinda makes the ""love"" scene a little scary, he talks like a caveman but is some super strong intelligent alien race. Ariel, while I could see would be some frightened girl is pretty much a shell she has no personality and falls in love with this Alien who rapes her and finds she just loves having sex with him, here I can only say . . . wait . . . what? There's too many poorly written sex scene don't get me wrong I love a good romance and I appreciate well written love scenes but these were lack luster and seemed to come on every other page. Also once they make it to his home planet the author was not very creative, the world consist of three colors, I love red, purple and black but the whole planet in this three color palette is boring. She also seems to like the words snarl and growl they were used far too often, using the same words over and over again makes reading this book tedious. I got this book for free had I not and actually spent the way too high asking price I would have returned it when I hit the fifth page on my kindle. There are way too many good self-published authors out there to waste your time on this book.",0

"The title caught my interest.  Reading the free sample made it clear it's probably a book I'd enjoy, but I couldn't even make it all the way through the sample because the punctuation is just so wrong.  I really really want to read this, would even buy it based on the little I read, but every time I see a misplaced comma I cringe and the author descends another notch in my estimation.[Please note, all aspiring writers, commas do not go after ""and"" - I know we talk that way, but that's not proper punctuation; if you're going to go through all the effort to write a book, at least take a gander through Strunk and White.]So please, Dear Author, I beg you, have the punctuation corrected, because I'd really like to enjoy your story [and be able to upgrade my rating to more stars].  An entertaining, fresh voice in the paranormal romance arena is a joy to find, but it's got to be cringe-free reading.",0
"Reading a story from Kallysten always brings me similar thoughts:  each story will have some connection (either via series or in feel) to another of her stories,  the world will be unique and well defined, the characters will feel familiar even if I haven't met them before, and the paranormal twists will present a whole other set of options for a reader.Blurred Nights is no different:  consisting of a world that is seen in two other series, just with timeline and character adjustments, Kallysten brings another dimension to the worlds already established in other books.  While being familiar with the other series is NOT necessary, the writing and characters in this will have you searching out the other stories: this will certainly help to provide more insight into the connected worlds.Characters are beautifully defined and described, with personal insecurities and preferences that are easy to relate to and understand,  with conflicts  occurring as characters seek to overcome their differences and fears to make connections that are both imminently destined and oh so right.  There are sexy and sensual scenes that serve to enhance the connections between the characters so well defined and displayed by witty conversations and asides, obvious protectiveness and chemistry that is apparent to all.I received an eBook from the author for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.",1
"This story started very well, and then it flailed in all directions.I think it was because it was setting the story up for sequels, but if I don't care any more for any of the characters or where they go in sequels by 2/3 into the book I'm not going to finish the book, and will never read any sequels.",0
"The plot of this novella will read like a rehash to anybody passing familiar with Harlequins.  By itself, that is not an issue.  What is an issue is the absolutely abysmal quality of the writing.  I'm pretty certain that English isn't Kelly's first language.  That wouldn't be a problem if she had asked somebody, anybody, to proofread the darn thing.  Other reviewers have done a great job of pointing out the many flaws.  They pile on top of each other until it is virtually impossible to pay attention to anything else.What I found particularly annoying was the author's over-reliance on ""so"" and ""such.""""She looked back at him, so angry.""  ""He growled with such a masculine sound.""(The male main, by the way, does everything with ""such a masculine sound.""  It got to the point that I asked my husband if he could spend the evening laughing and growling and sighing like Nikias, with ""such a masculine sound.""  He tried some different ways, but we never really figured out how he could growl in a non-masculine way, unless he deliberately tried to sound like Eartha Kitt or something).Bottom line:  Retread plot, terrible writing.  Even for free, reading this book costs too much.",0
"Every book I read and love resonates with me. As I'm sure it does for others who enjoy a good book. This one, as I read it, made me think of my relationship with my husband and the power of a transcendent love.Summary: The sight of the red door saves Colin Baxter in his dream, but very quickly a man appears and the dream becomes a thing of raw sexual need with a person Colin can't identify. He just knows the man needs him, and Colin aches to find and heal his lover...even if the man doesn't really exist.Marek Donovan just wants to be left alone to lick his wounds and recover from a terrible loss. The rundown house in Fiji suits his minimal needs just fine. He doesn't want to face the world again, and on a small, secluded island figures he's safe from everyone and everything. Particularly guilt from his past.Dreams of this nameless man and his house plague Colin for two years, but he's come to care about his phantom lover so deeply he doesn't want them to end. Then Colin visits Fiji and comes face-to-face with the house from his visions, prompting him to believe these dreams just might be his destiny.Colin knocks on the door, determined to find answers.What I liked about this book: This is one of the Cameron Dane books that is not just smoking hot but grips your heart, clenches it in a tight fist and doesn't let go from start to finish! I have to admit that I had a harder time reading this one than the other books because it deals with such a huge loss and the pain that guilt from losing someone you love because of your own pride causes and I was not prepared emotionally to delve into that quagmire.But Marek and Colin kept drawing me to their story and with every step into their budding and troubled relationship, I fell deeper into the hope of their ""happily ever after"". Cameron Dane has that wonderful ability to not just make the characters come to life, but their raw emotions slam into you with such fierceness, you find yourself gasping and verbally outing yourself while reading her books in public.",1
"I purchased this book for my kindle for 2 reasons: 1 It was written by the author who wrote the Chase Brother series which I thouroughly enjoyed (and highly recommend) and To Do List, and 2 it had some good reviews. Had I known that it was BDSM I would not have purchased it. To each their own, this was not for me. I would stick to To Do List since that book is the ""prequel"" to this one and is a lot more tame. If you want racy and are okay with the whole BDSM thing, than this book is for you.",0

"I would rate this 0 starts if possible.I had such high hopes for this book! i was excited to read it...The first chapter was good, it pulled you in immediately, but It was boring by the second chapter. I kept  hoping for it to pick up, provide some kind of information, get thick into the plot, or even let you get to know a character. half way through the book there was STILL  NOTHING. A Half of a book of bantering with the ex-wife and psycho brother in law. The son is supposed to be a suspect but yet he wasn't an active character. He said only a handful of things.  The actions of these characters  were far fetched, unrealistic, and ridiculous. Nothing was revealed, there were no suspects to get to know in order to play the ""who dunnit"" guessing game. The characters were unlikable, what you knew of them anyway, and scarce. I almost put the book down, but I decided to plug along since I had wanted to read it so badly when I bought it. At 51% was when I finally learned the first relevant piece of info. At 55% was finally a description of what Raine looked like. Out of 43 chapters, only 5 of them would have been sufficient to tell the same story.",0
"I had a problem with this story straight off the bat.Eleanor is a submissive and yet she has a smart mouth and likes to bait her Dom into proving who's in charge. Forgive me if I'm wrong but a well trained Sub will not act in such a manner. Besides which, the creep factor for her Dom is off the charts. So I was already put off before Eleanor was even 'gifted' to her recluse 'master' for the week. *eye roll*I'm open to and often enjoy reading a good BDSM sex scene, but lacklustre to the point of boringly clinical supposed hot sex is what I got.I've read hotter stuff in a standard Harlequin book (hot isn't just defined by how adventurous the sex is!) this was just icky, and quite frankly yawn worthy.As well as Eleanor being a bad sub, and the boring sex, there just seemed to be a lot of other stuff that didn't make sense to me either, but if I completely pick it apart I'd be here all day.Overall, I didn't like the characters or the narrative, and I definitely didn't enjoy the sex.The whole thing was just too shallow for me sorry. 1 Star :[",0
"Coombes Woods by L.C. Hinsley begins with the Izzy indecisive struggle with signing the papers now or later.  We come to learn that she, with her 13 year-old son Connor, has recently (and secretly) left her husband.  This is her second partnering, as her first was with Connor's biological father.The opening interchange with the Housing Council's Mrs. Roberts really showed Izzy as someone who's uncomfortable with making sudden or rash seeming decisions. However, she doesn't want her hesitation to best her either.  This is supported later with her expressed regret to Alana that she should have left her husband years ago.At the end of this transaction, the mystery of Coombe's Woods begins:  Why was Mrs. Roberts staring?  What was with the ornate walking cane?  Izzy has seen it before, but where?Later as Izzy's back story is divulged to the reader, the memory of the cane returns to her: Connor's dad had one similar to it and he was also from Cedham (where they've just moved to).  Now we know that something deliciously interesting could be in the mix.I'm a fan of the story so far.The writing, however, did stall in places with an overload of redundancy.  Some of it may have been necessary to convey a message to the reader, but using it as a tool too many times becomes, well, redundant.  I felt the following portions were examples:~To take the flat now or not...in Mrs. Roberts office.  In the end it seemed a good use to demonstrate Izzy's character.~The scene with writing on Connor's room's wall.  I know that this was to hit a point home, but I felt it played a little too long.Lines of comment:~'Izzy half expected an onion to be pulled from the desk drawer... Eat this apple, she'd say.'  I liked this one.  Plays into the whole theme.~'Take care in the woods. That's what that odd woman had said.' Followed by a description of what Izzy sees outside.  While I like the mini-scene, it would work better to have Izzy 'see' first then have that cause her recollection.Just nitpicks really.Overall, I like the originality of the story's premise and the author's writing is clever and engaging enough to keep my interest.  I hope to read more.",1
"The premise of the story was an interesting one: a series of classmates being murdered several years after they graduated. Unfortunately, the overall plot and the price (free) are about the only good things I can say about this novel. Sorry, Mr. Moats!The book was riddled with run-on sentences and spelling errors, and the author's sentence structure was much too choppy for my taste. As a former English teacher, I can honestly say I've seen 8th grade essays that were much more beautifully written than this.And while the premise of the story is a good one, I just didn't think Mr. Moats did it any justice. Many, many points in the story were completely unbelievable. I realize that it must be difficult to write a mystery, but I found myself thinking many aspects of this story were just too convenient. There wasn't much thinking involved in this mystery; in fact, I think the only brain power I used while reading this novel was just to correct the grammatical errors!",0

"This book had a lot of potential - vampires, sexy independent heroine... and then it fizzled. I like a little character development with my sex scenes. There wasn't any in this book, and I never got why we were supposed to care about any of the characters in the book, much less their sex lives.",0
"The first Hell Cop was incredibly enjoyable and something just that little bit different. In this 2nd book they're building on already established relationships and reading it was like visiting with old friends. God. I am such a sap. But it was just so good!Trust Me, by Astrid Amara, has Jay and Brian a year down the track. Jay still delights in being able to touch someone and Brian is growing into his own skin after the revelations' in the previous book. The growth of the characters relationship was beautifully done and the hook of Brian's lack of control was an engaging one. He begins to realize that his ability to touch Jay does not exclude him from being left and his need to learn to control his power, or risk loosing his lover, becomes paramount. A sexy, perceptively written story that does not just look at the surface of a relationship, but delves deeply into its workings.In Dark Waters, by Nicole Kimberling, the world building is tight and I like her attention to little things that make for vivid reading. The balance of power in a relationship, knowing when to listen and when to argue, brought a warmness to the story. Michael is such a professor and I like how out of his comfort zone he is with Argent at times, when he cannot use his mind reading powers. Parts were also surprisingly funny and had me laughing out loud. I think Bert's - a bunch of drunken goat-legged midgets and that poor, maligned turtle were rather amusing. hehe.Finally, in Such Heights by Ginn Hale, dark and broody Moran returns on another case with his blond and gorgeous journalist lover  James. Moran is still determined to resist till the last and I think there is nothing more satisfying than reading about this cop being brought to his knees. So to speak. O-o The floating palace was a very cool world with tentacle like spells and enslaved demons, which made for a cool backdrop for the characters.Freeloading, hippie mermaids, large bovine like creatures, pocket demons and castles that travel about in the air. These 3 authors write books that I want to read. Get it here from Loose Id. Also, check out Hell Cop 1 here.",1
"I'm not much of a romance fan, but this story sounded like just the thing to cleanse my literary palate for the new year. The fact that it's relatively short and just 99 cents definitely helped. But frankly, I was a little disappointed.First, the other reviewer's comment about the formatting for Kindle was spot on. Bizarre characters, strange indenting, chapter titles that start at the bottom of a page, typos - it needs some cleaning up. It's very distracting when you're trying to get into a story. That said, the formatting in no way influenced my rating.The Haircut is a wonderful concept but the execution could have been better. The back and forth in the barber shop went on *forever* using the same words and phrases. I understand that the barber was conflicted about the girl's request. I understand the girl wanted it done ""like the boy's haircut."" But the characters just kept saying the exact same thing. I enjoy scenes of conflict but this one just got tedious.As I said, I don't read romances so perhaps this is a common device, but the repetition throughout seemed to be included to simply fill space. It was so distracting and frustrating, in fact, that I simply stopped reading about 60% in. I mean, the ending isn't any secret, is it?So why did I give it three stars? It's a lovely story, and I really enjoyed learning a little about Misha. I also think tightening it up by about a third would make this a very readable little gem.If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!",0
This works perfectly to fit the K3 in its amazon cover (with or without light) for added protection. The fit is snug and it is perfectly sized to put in a purse or bag. No it is not the ultimate in protection but it works excellently to store my Kindle 3 in its case and I have no complaints. If I'm going to go somewhere that it needs even more protection (I'm a bit paranoid) then I use my Borsa Bella Bag with it as well. At the current discounted price pick yourself one up as it's so easy to use! Recommended!,1
The story started out well and before you know it you are finished and looking for the next chapter.I went back to the beginning thinking I missed something.....but there was nothing there.I know this was a short story....but don't give me a story and then start another book.

"I struggled through this book. It has a very nice stopryline but the manner in which &#34;Tessa&#34; is provide through italics, I found boring.

I hope that she will redeem herself in my eyes.",0
"I tried for two weeks to read this book & like it. Halfway thru I finally accepted that its just not gonna happen. I usually read 2-4 books a week on average so only getting halfway thru after 2 weeks is very uncommon. I only persisted in trying to finish it because of all the glowing reviews.I enjoy a good build-up like anybody but, it should keep you engaged. I fell asleep EVERY TIME I picked this book up. The insignificant & redundant information just bored me to tears. For example, how many times must the type of a &#34;swivel chair&#34; be mentioned?? Ugh. And referring to something by a name & not explaining what it meant until chapters later, really? Why?I saw other reviewers likening this book to Stephen King, unless they meant Tommyknockers (SNORE), I'm not seeing it.I don't usually review books I find unfavorable but I felt a need to fill in others so they don't come away feeling like I did. To strike a slight balance since most of these reviewers gush on in a way that leaves me feeling as though they read a completely different story than I did, or tried to. You may like it but, you may not.",0

"The title of this review is no reference to the evil doings in the novella's fictional town. Instead it refers to the quality of the work, its length, and the ludicrous price attached to it. Fifty percent of the length of this digital download is dedicated to an interview with the author and promotions of his other work. This betrays the early days of digital books and poor business decision-making in the price/value equation. In terms of the novella itself, it is a terrible homage to Jackson's The Lottery and King's Children of the Corn. After thoroughly enjoying Crouch's Run this was extremely disappointing.",0
"Erickson's characters are well-drawn for what they are and their feelings and actions drive the plot.  Switching perspective between the two main characters keeps the story moving forward at a comfortable pace and the sex scenes are wonderfully steamy.  In fact, I was listening to this novel on Kindle text-to-voice while driving and almost had to turn it off for being too distracting.My only note -- and this is minor -- is that the charity set up didn't make complete sense to me.  You can't set up a charity home to keep kids out of foster care -- it would just be foster care in a group setting.  It didn't really detract from the book -- it was just obvious that Erickson was looking for something to lend depth to the characters.I would certainly read Erickson's other novels.",1
"I jumped at the chance to get a free F.Heaton book considering she's never disappointed me before but she totally dropped the ball on this book.

"I can't emphasize this enough - bad grammar can absolutely ruin a book for me.This writer has massive difficulties with pronouns. She is constantly mixing up the use of him/himself, she/herself, he/him, she/her, and I/me.It is like hitting a brick wall when this happens, taking the reader completely out of the flow of what is otherwise a pretty decent book.I'd advise she either get an editor with a grammatical background or some grammar lessons.",0

This was would have been good had it been longer but this was just ridiculously short and even though I was expecting it, I was still surprised by how quickly it was over. There simply isn't enough time to build any character background enough to care about them in that time.The guy has good ideas but really need to learn to expand on them!",0

"This is sci-fi non-consensual pet play/age play - heavier on the age play than the pet play.  I'm OK with non-con capture fantasies, so that was't the big problem for me.  It was Bach actually having an internal moment where was uncomfortable with having sex with what he thought of essentially an animal - and then goes ahead and does it without reservation later.  The author does try to mitigate that later, but it takes a long time until he actually views Pani as a person that he treats as a pet, not an actual pet.I don't have an issue with spanking books, so much as when the spanking goes from &#34;correction&#34; (as it is euphemistically labeled in so many books) to abuse - serious over the top beating for really no reason at all - which this book does.  I also struggle in general with age play - why would an adult think having sex with a child is a good thing?  This book never really explored why treating somebody like a toddler would turn them on any way that could possibly be deemed socially acceptable.I gave it 3 stars because the writing was very good - the world building was good, the characters were well developed.  I went on to read Pani's story because I was hoping that it would help me understand why the age play was erotic - and it did help.",0

"Rating: 3.3 out of 5Every once in a while, I run across a book that I can't help but think, ""If there had been just this much more work put into it (or perhaps a little more), it could have been special.""Ladies and gentlemen, I give you The Gift of Fury by Richard Jackson.The setup of the book is as follows - Count Albritton (that's his name, not his title...weird, I know, but it works) is a paranormal investigator working out of New York City.  He and his friends (a pair of wizards, a vampire of some sort, and an immortal warrior) run up against a man named Jack Meredith, a wealthy entrepreneur who desires more than simply predicting how to work the stock market in his favor.It seems that Mr. Meredith has gone to great lengths to awaken the Seven, a powerful group of beings harkening from the ""Old Days"" of magic.  And it turns out that our beloved Count, who holds a special relationship with a magical ring called the Bloodstone, is the only one who can stop him.I so, so wanted to love this book.  The author has a fantastic voice, telling the tale from Count's viewpoint.  He goes in-depth about the workings of the magical world that exists just beneath our own ""real"" world, explaining things such as the Witching Hour, different types of vampires, and the differentiations of various forms of magical practices.  It was honestly quite entertaining to read.  Jackson paints a vision of New York that is mysterious as well as mundane, and he takes some well-known (and not so well-known) locations and makes them shine anew.  Great job there.The characters who surround the fabulously sarcastic Count, also have their own distinct voices.  Highest on this list is Hagan, the eternal warrior.  He's gruff and strangely carefree, the type of braggart that can't wait to let everyone around him know of his exploits, whether he should or not.  Also intriguing was Scott Dorward, one of the two sorcerers Count associates with.  He is wonderfully quirky and straightforward.  The few scenes he appears in are some of the best in the whole book.As for the plot...it's simple but it works.  When it all gets boiled down, this is an adventure story.  Its aim is to present a new world and entertain you.  The only real theme I could find would be find yourself, young man, as Count doesn't understand the power he possesses and must constantly work to harness.  As I said, it's simple but enjoyable.And then we have the problems, which are many.  I usually don't make a huge deal of the editing in books - a few typos don't bother me - but this one is rife with so many errors it became distracting.  Also, it is told in first-person present tense - which is a difficult style to pull off effectively - and even the flashbacks are presented in this way.  It completely interrupts the flow of the story.  Every time this happened, I had to scroll back to see if what I was reading happened now or then.  Change the tense, man!On the subject of those flashbacks, there were at least two too many.  We could've done without discovering how Count found the Bloodstone or first met Hagan.  These facts could have easily been disclosed organically through conversation or informative snippets, without exposition.These aspects of the novel came close to ruining it for me.  Close, but not quite.  I still had a good time with it, and I thought the world author Jackson created seemed fresh and new.  It's too bad there are so many irritants, because were those facets not there, this could've been something special.As presently constructed, it's a fun rough draft, not a final product.Which is a shame.Plot - 7Characters - 9Voice - 8Execution - 3Personal Enjoyment - 6Overall - 33/50 (3.3/5)",0
"Another great story from Hill. Loved the characters. Couldn't put it down. The main characters showed what true faith is, of putting others above ourselves. Hill always finds a way to move me with her stories of faith and pure love relationships.",1

You can always count on Ms. Glenn for a good story and Full Moon Mating is total entertainment.LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
It was really good. Especially for a harliquin romance. It had depth and lots of character development. I really liked it.,1
"This just wasn't okay. Nope. I know it is free, so i can't complain, and i do know how hard authors work on their books but this one is just a no, not for me, it just didn't make sense. I hate leaving crap reviews and i feel just awful about leaving a one star, but i also believe honesty is the best policy.",0
"I did not like this book. Tre was so angry at Leigh. He would treat her poorly that she was afraid to be in the same room with him. Tre felt his heart was being ripped out everything he saw Leigh. It took them over ten years to get this right. I really dont like a book with the majority of it is filled with questions never being asked and a lot of assumtions. Then as the other reviewer mention was the ending. There was no ending. Once everything was reveled and it looked like they could finially be together Leigh leaves Tre for serveral months. She didnt call him, she didnt return his calls nothing. Again the lack of communication. Then she just comes back with the carefee additude and the writer was giving you the impression that Leigh my be pregnant but nothing was mentioned. Did not like this one at all.Go read her other book - Addicted to  you. She wrote this under the name of Bethany Kane.",0
"I must have not read the reviews on this carefully.  The beginning sounded interesting and the ending was ideal.  However, the rest - let's just say if you like nothing but total sex, then you will enjoy this book. Too much of a good thing can get boring. This was the case for me.",0
"This captures the essence of the Holocaust but is filled with the bitterness for the Polish people. As a descendant of several Polish people who were killed by the Nazis for hiding numerous Jewish people during WWII, I feel that the author has unfairly portrayed the entire Polish race. Having grown up knowing three Jewish people that members of my family died to save, I take particular offense to this attitude. I know the author suffered unspeakable horrors during the Holocaust, but not all Polish people are evil. I only wish I could speak with Mr. Milder to let him know how perhaps someone he knew was perhaps saved by someone I lost.",1
"I have read other books by this author, and enjoyed them.  So when I saw this book, I didn't hesitate to buy it.  I only made it about 10 pages in before I was completely disgusted and deleted it off of my Kindle.  I don't mind when writers put graphic sex scenes into books; but I would prefer them to not be within the first 2 pages of the book, and have disgusting orgy scenes.  What little of the book I actually was able to finish had 9 pages of sex to 1 page of actual plotline. This book is also extremely short for the money you spend on it (not that I made it through the book but could have easily finished it in an hour). If you actually enjoy reading novels that have a plot and are well written, do not buy this one.",0
"disappointing short story.  The characters are likable, albeit stock in trade for M/M love stories:  a cop; a Doctor; and a bird with a broken wing.  I wish Annmarie had taken the time to develop the story and the characters. I would have been disappointed if this cost a buck...",0
i really thought this book was going to be better from the reviews.  Maybe it was more of a teenage type book than an adult one.  I didnt' read the second book in the series was not that interested.,0
I love Gena Showalter books. Even her short stories display her rich imagination and keeps you craving for more.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good read.,1
This is a short and touching story about a estranged brother at his sister's wedding falling for the groom's father after cruising each other at the hotel where they were staying. I was pleasantly surprised that the characters were so well developed is such a short span. The plot thickened! The matching was great and the story ended up being an enjoyable read.,1

"Okay so the zombies in this book just show up pretty much instantly.  And the characters start shooting them and they seem to run outta ammo.  In a police station.  Yes, a police station is running out of ammo after about 5 minutes of a zombie attack.Then our three red shirts are killed off and our bland main character is left and she drives off.What's lame is that this book is pretty much a wannabe of Ben Tripp's book ""Rise Again.""  Only this book was nowhere near as interesting as Tripp's was.You can skip this one.",0
"I don&#8217;t know what I was expecting but I was not expecting what I read. The book was written in 1910 so customs were different but I could not finish this racist treatise. The author speaks freely about darkies and being whipped. He describes people in more inappropriate verse as well. As a history buff, this was interesting regarding the times and customs, but it is sickening read.",0

"For the love of all that is holy get a competent proofreader. The books could be very good but the errors are amateurish at best and i won't be buying any more of your stuff until you get a clue. You know, at first I thought this was just bad editing but after reviewing the book again I seriously suspect it is also just plain bad writing. No one who cares would allow their work to go to the public as badly prepared as this is.",0
I found this book to be very helpful.  The author explains a lot of information in a very easy way to understand.,1

"Home for Christmas is a delightful holiday read. Cruising for the Christmas Holiday season is a great idea especially when it's with the hot and handsome man of your dreams!

Good read.  It kept my attention the whole time.  The story flowed well.  It was a hot and steamy read,1
I loved this book. Great characters and lots of sarcasm in between kisses...the heroine was a but dumb in understanding the  vampire world existence. Other than that it was great.,1
This was a very enjoyable story.  Milo and Mya are interesting people that are exciting to learn more about.  The plot was formulaic but the characters are so much fun it's okay that the storyline takes a backseat to their personalities.  This is a quality read that is incredibly priced. Buy it.,1
"I was leery of this book due to the ""teenage"" appearance of the cover. Thought it'd be a cheesy vamp/romance. Totally untrue! From the first page I was HOOKED. Great read. NOT for teens. Don't let the R.L Stine- ish cover fool you...it's pretty intense in places. Also, for those of us ""less discerning"" readers, lol, it's a book that took me into the world far enough that the inconsistencies didn't negatively affect the book in the least. I do however hope that the next one has an even better flow.",1
"This is the second in a series. The first is The Diamond Heartstone.PLOT: Prince Jorel has been pressured by his father into finding his mate. They use the mysterious woman known as the Traveller to find her. His mate happens to be Allyson Gray, a police officer investigating the disappearance of Alysia James. Jorel travels to her dimension to bring her home.PROS: It had it's good moments.CONS: Allyson was so annoying. It's one thing to be strong and tough, but Allyson took it to the point that I wanted to hit her. Frankly, I don't even know why Jorel was needed for this story. The author basically neutered him. Ally does all the fighting and saving. I don't object to a strong female lead. I don't object to a woman saving herself. What I object to mostly was that he couldn't even have a simple conversation with this prickly, irritable woman.More realism was needed. I accept another dimension with shapeshifting people, but human nature should still be the same. Allyson comes to this new dimension with very few questions. I think it would be natural to be full of questions and wonder at this new world.The little detail about Alysia James gets abandoned or forgotten. Ally never finds her. I mention this because I don't feel like I'm spoiling a key plot point here. Ally never mentions Alysia again after she's kidnapped by Jorel.2 STARS: I had to force myself to finish this one. It's not that long and yet at 65 percent done, I was mentally 100 percent sick of the overbearing Allyson.",0

"Considering this guy is a navy seal, I was thinking there would be some action taking place, but it was all off-screen. The sex was very explicit and frequent. When they weren't having sex, they were talking about it. The sex overwhelmed what would have been an otherwise good story. If you like lots of sex and little story, than this book is for you. If you want more than just really hot sex and dirty talk, than give this book a pass.",0
"This writer truly, truly needs to do some sort of historical research before writing  an &#34;historical&#34; romance. I'm not asking for the meticulous research of &#34;Gone With the Wind&#34;, &#34;Forever Amber&#34; or any other classic historical, BUT a debutante would never, EVER be allowed to attend balls, parties or a walk without a CHAPERONE. Seriously! A carriage ride would have called for at least a MAID to accompany an unmarried, well brought up young woman.  This was just ridiculous. Ms. DeGioia, please do a tiny bit of research of the social mores of the time period you're writing about. UGH! A long dress and a carriage do not a 'historical&#34; novel make.",0
"Typos aside, I thought the idea and the general plot was good. The main character is pretty awesome and leads the story well enough. Unfortunately, from the beginning I felt like this was the 2nd or 3rd book of a series. The background is sort of filled in eventually, but it takes almost the entire book to do so, including the 'bonus story.'While I do love the characters Count and Kara, everything else about the book was difficult to follow and enjoy. The flow of the plot was not smoothe. The other characters seemed unfinished. I don't normally mind being thrown in the middle of a setting with gradual background information released as I read, but the author did a poor job of intergrating the reader into his world at a good pace. The beginning was very busy and had a lot going on, only as a recap in his hospital stay, and THEN the reader is put into the present time, which is slow moving. The bonus story felt like another ""how I met this other character"" mini story that was put in at random fillers during the plot.Count and Kara are good characters. The others need more polish. The book as a whole seemed completely unorganized. The idea for this magical world and its characters is great, but it's poorly executed.",0
"Robyn Andrews is running from her past with nowhere to go and fearing for her life.  Trigg is a Watcher who has pledged to hunt rogue vampires and protect the human race.  When Robyn tries to save him she has no idea of what she is getting herself into.Trigg is a vampire, Robyn is human and the two don't mix.  Can Robyn and Trigg get over their differences?  Will Trigg's world allow them to be together?Midnight Reborn is a great peek into a new world.  Trigg is so conflicted and adorable.  Robyn is conflicted in her own way.  They are both strong characters with issues to work through.  Trigg is there for Robyn every step of the way even when he feels it is best to leave.  D. McEntire brings this world to life in such a way that it drew me in.  The only thing I wanted more of was Robyn's emotions.  First I want to say I LOVED Midnight Reborn, but I wish Robyn's emotions were more upfront.  I felt that there was a wall she hid behind.  Robyn went through so much and she was so raw, but all I felt was her tough front.  Maybe it is just me, but she bounced back so fast and I wanted...more.Ms. McEntire has a wonderful world in her Watcher's series and I can't wait for the next installment.JambreaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"So far I have enjoyed the menage in this story and the partner to this. I hope this continues and we find out how they all connect. The men in this one kept me tingling all through it.

For those of you with a great visual imagination, make sure you have something available to help put out the flames.",1
"As the other reviewers have described the book accurately, I will just give opinion. I made the mistake of reading SBFD first, not realizing it was a series, so Jon and Cole, very small parts in this book, already had my loyalty. I also liked Matt and Jared from Promises. I found Zach to be nice, but kind of an airhead. Angelo - ugh. No way. As one of the prev reviewers mentioned every relationship is different, but I had no respect for Zach for putting up w/ Angelo and saw nothing appealing or redeeming in Angelo's character to make it worthwhile. Additionally, I actually saw why Jon left Zach originally. Sweet but kind of goofy. The writing is good. I just need characters I can identify with or at least appreciate in some way.",0
"I will admit that Part 1 of this novella did keep me intrigued enough to want to read Part 2.

"Dan is 3/8 Indian and, while seemingly unbelieving, has sleeping and occasional waking dreams, as had his mother, of coyote's the trickster and shape shifters. These are like barely heard background noises.  His wife had died of cancer a year ago, his bright beautiful daughter is off to work and to summer school.  He had grown up in the four corners area and in the service had done intelligence work, he is retired and is now a high school math teacher on his way to teaching summer classes after dropping his daughter off.A niece calls while he is traveling and begs for help, her husband is hiding in the desert accused of a murder he says he did not commit and she wants Dan to investigate.  He did not think a lot of her husband and going ""home"" brought back memories.  His parents had disappeared mysteriously many years ago and his older brother was killed in an auto accident about 18 years ago.He can defend himself, but this is not an action adventure hero who mops up the bad guys with a flurry of kicks and shot gun blasts. He stays in shape but is not a combat robot, he thinks and analyses and follows clues and once engaged is very persistent.  He pulls the threads of a tangled web spun by a loose conspiracy of men who have and seek power and riches above all, letting no one (least of all family) get in their way.  An interesting hero and a good tale.  I look forward to reading other books.",1
"First and most important is the writing errors were so bad and so many,  some of them I could figure out but most of them I couldn't made this a REALLY hard read.

His voice is perfect for the Lovecraft genre.",1
"I absolutely loved the world that this author created in this first book of her series.  I was, however, very disappointed in, NOT the story itself but, the main heroine.  She was unrelatable (I know its not a word but it should be one....haha), unexplained, annoying, combative, freakish and overall WRONGLY cast!  On the other hand...I LOVED every other character (and their awesome complexities).  I just started reading the next book in the series and I am truly hoping that I never see another character like Diane again because this is a truly intriguing world!

"An atypical Vampire heroine and other characters make this highly detailed view from a transition between mortal, immortal, depraved humanity and vampirism and all flavors in emotion. This goes for many of the characters. The treatment of human characters other than that of the heroine is somewhat shallow. Treatments of the vampire characters are deep and detailed. Thus the humans seem shallow, and the vampires have more character. This is diametric to the normal vampire genre, and quite refreshing. There is steamy sex, butchery, finesse, exhilaration, drug dependence, love, hate, jealousy, revenge, depression, murder, salvation. I found the book to be a little wordy, but who cares if it's fun to read anyway? Makes the experience last longer.I would recommend it to others and wait impatiently for more.",1
What a difference life was when this book was written.  The author gives such great details of the events then,1
"As I read this story I felt like a fan watching a crash at a NASCAR race. I kept trying to look away but I was drawn to see just how bad it could be. As 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' was to movies, this book is to Science Fiction.Stilted dialogue, complete ignorance of military aspects, one dimensional characters, abysmal grasp of science, a concept military vehicle that is so totally implausible that I laughed out loud, all blended together with a bizarre world view of how people behave. I kept thinking that the author was either brilliantly satirizing and mocking survivalist thinking or he was a horrifically bad writer. I still don't know.I gave the story two stars because the author made me determined to read book two of the series to find out.",0
"The first 40% of the book is a bit disorganized. It switches between 2 main characters, it doesn't explain much about the 2 characters. It gets fairly decent for the next 40% or so, but then you get to the end & the ending is flat & uninspirational. This could have been a good book, but sadly it went way off the rails.",0
"I read the reviews and synopses for Stormy Glenn's whole Tri-Omega series. The stories and premise seemed great, and they were. Unfortunately, I could barely get through them. These books were filled with misspellings, grammatical errors, mistakes, omissions, and every other intensely annoying thing that can be done to novels to render them all but unreadable. If you're able to get past that without losing your connection with the story, you'll really enjoy the series. If, like me, slamming into some huge error in the writing derails your train of thought, you'd be better off moving on.",0
"Although I only read the first part of her story, it is hard to imagine that a little girl had to endure what she did.  This is something that should not be real and only happens in horror stories.",1
"** I would give this 2.5* if I could.**THE KNIFE'S EDGE seemed like it would be a nice, quick selection for the feature. If I remember correctly, the story was touted as an erotic romance. But what it really read like was a prequel teaser, or maybe a prologue for a much more in-depth novel. The reader is literally dropped into the middle of a fairly complicated political scenario. The narrator, Dardanus, is an advisor to the lonely Queen Nestra. Since he is a ""bastard"", Dardanus can never assume what he believes is his rightful position as king. His plan is to seduce the Queen, convince her to remove her magical medallion (whose magic is never explained), then kill her.The chemistry between the two characters is nice, though short-lived. When the two finally make it to the bed, it's nothing to write home about. One page. Yep, one page of implied copulation. In fact, the most fun I've had with this is coming up with the phrase ""implied copulation."" Whee. (said with a sad face) OH, and Dardanus slaps Nestra. And not in a playful, naughty way, but in a ""Say yes, b*tch"" way. Look, I'm all for fun and games or whatever, but that kind of pissed me off. NO HITTING.I'm not saying that THE KNIFE'S EDGE was bad. The writing was actually really good. But I felt it was advertised as something it's clearly not. And, AND...almost half of the downloaded book was excerpts from other books by the author. But, the story was free, so, at least I didn't waste any money. But still, I feel waaaay let down.Favorite Quote:"" 'I'm not ashamed of you. I'm ashamed of myself.

"This book rocks!  Seriously.  The great thing about shifters is how they know they've found their mate.  I love that premise.  This one has the added twist of Robyn's deafness and how it affects the mating.  Keil is one hot and yummy alpha, and together they are just fantastic.",1
"I gave this book four stars in hopes that the rest of the series gets better.  The book makes a good introduction piece but ended suddenly.  The plot was typical and predicable with only one delightful twist and that was that the heroine was deaf.  She did not know she was a wolf and accepted the &#34;unbelievable&#34; stuff way to readily.  The couple had no obstacles to overcome, there were no struggles.  It was love at first sight followed by lots of sex.  This book would be good for a quick, short, steamy read if you were just trying to get excited.  However, Arend does a good job at storytelling.  I just felt that were was no &#34;meat&#34; to the story.  I am going to try the next book with high hopes!",1
"It doesn't really show what life is like in a Tank.  It shows cheery and gallant young chaps enjoying their leaves, occasionally gallantly charging the German lines.  It does illustrate that the British didn't know what the hell to do with their new tanks.

"I've collected about 100 Kindle complete works now.  Sadly, this was one of the 3 worst.The main killer for this collection -- Monospace font.  The whole collection is in a large, unchangable font.  Also, there are no marker bars between stories or chapters (active table of contents).If the font was fixed, I'd add a star.As for the writing, this is Dickens.  Five stars for the content.",0
"I read this book with high expectations and it sounded like a very interesting read.  Unfortunately, there was no substance.  There was absolutely no storyline. This was truly a waste of time. I finally began skipping sections towards the middle.  I wish these authors would read romance novels from the late 80s and early 90s when the love scene was limited to almost nothing and the book just had a great story.  I recently found that type of romance in a book called Being Plumville.  I wish we had better writers.",0
I found this book rather slow and in fact haven't finished it yet.  Don't think I will try this author again.,0
"this story is a wild ride, I really enjoy it, it was fun.  But if you have issues with sex, this book is not for you, cause it is full of it.",1
"This is on one hand the poorly told sexual adventures of an inept detective who has sex with every woman he meets  and complex orgies which he sets up. Generally the sexual imagery is ambiguous at best and does not provide the reader with a clear image of what is going on, though initially the reader is drawn in by the voracious  sexual appetite of the main character. Both his personal and fantasy life are filled with sexual encounters that have no negative consequences. In his mind he is every woman's dream come true. The writer fails to carry out any plot. The 'climax' and resolution of only one issue is not brought about by the main character. Sexually devoid of emotion, despite the frequent poorly described sexual encounters that are filled with verbiage,  this books lacks substance soul and a good story line. It is told primarily from the male perspective even when the woman is narrating her experiences. The writer needs to use a dictionary and eliminate half of the words used to describe his characters  sexual experiences. Fantasy best describes this book, that is poorly typed and in need of at least one good plot.",0
I had read all these years ago.  I recently found Wings in the Night Part 1 for a real deal and decided to download to my kindle and revisit one of my favorite series from long ago.  I got caught up again.  I then immediately upon finishing part 1 downloaded Wings in the Night Part 2 and read all of them.  I am now looking on the Wings in the Night Web Site and checking for Rhiannon's Chronicles and info on the new books coming out.  This series does not disappoint.  It matters not if you are revisiting it or if you are a first timer.  It will set the scene for the new books and/or give you a great series for your immediate enjoyment.  I highly recommend.,1
"THIS IS A VERY GOOD READ, GOOD PLOT, KEPT ME INTERESTED TO THE END.  ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS THE ANT HILL PART, NOT TOO PLAUSIBLE.  OTHERWISE, I WAS ENTERTAINED RATHER ECONOMICALLY.",1
"I enjoyed the premise of the book, but it seemed very disjointed at several points in the book . . .so much so that I e enjoyable went back to be sure that I hadn't skipped a few pages. When I got to the end, it seemed like it was the middle of the book still.  Very disappointing.",0
"Parker Quinn is a New York magazine editor who meets Dean Maxwell at a win-a-date charity auction. Dean is smart, suave and totally off-limits for Parker... because Dean is also her niece's baby-daddy. Dean ran out on Parker's younger sister when she told him of the pregnancy and his name has been blackballed by the Quinn family ever since.But there's undeniable heat and spark between Parker and Dean... and when he makes an outrageous bid for her body and whisks her away for a six-day weekend the inevitable happens.This erotic romance didn't sit well with me. There were so many niggling little problems with the entire relationship that I couldn't just let my mind go and enjoy the titillating romance.To start with, Parker and Dean's first meeting left me cold. They bump into one another at a win-a-date charity auction, and Dean chivalrously saves Parker from a grabby ex. Their following exchange is a little bit heated, very flirtatious and bordering on sleazy. But there was nothing in Parker's personality or Dean's hot-n-heavy come-on that I found endearing or warranting of the slight obsession they develop of each other. And I mean `obsession' - because the second Dean learns Parker's name he researches her, can't stop thinking about her and concocts a plan to win her over.... all in the space of a few hours. But I just didn't get what was so fascinating about Parker, apart from the fact that Dean really liked her body, wanted to see her naked and enjoyed `the chase'.More than anything though, I really couldn't understand Parker's attraction to Dean. I mean, yes he is handsome and rich and sophisticated... but he also impregnated and abandoned her little sister! Of course Parker battles a half-hearted protest with her conscience, but when Dean whisks her away to a private island for six days her resolve quickly crumbles.What really didn't sit well with me about all this was that Ann Bruce just throws money at the moral dilemma. `Parker's Price' really isn't a female-empowering read... because Parker pretty easily drops her sister in favour of Dean and his `I know someone who has a private island and he has loaned it to me' schtick. Parker believes that Dean left her sister high and dry when she was pregnant with his baby. I'm not saying that Parker's attraction to Dean is based solely on his assets... but that's kind of how it came across. But I'm sure the private island went a long way to easing Parker's guilt over sleeping with the man who fathered her niece.The dilemma of Dean's parenthood is examined in the second-half of the book... but Parker's confrontation of Dean does take a while to come about - she spends the first half of the book thinking about confronting him and raging at how immoral he is... but she's still attracted to him and wants to sleep with him. Ick.I never liked Dean. He just came across as sleazy and my female intuition was constantly red-alerting during his scenes. It was just little things that added up to a not-nice protagonist (though Bruce didn't mean for him to come across that way). Little things like him undressing Parker when they arrive at the private island and tucking her into bed while she sleeps. Eew. And the fact that he kept suggestively touching Parker even after she firmly said ""No. Don't do that. Don't touch me.""Running alongside the Parker/Dean dilemma romance is a side-story about Parker possibly being stalked... because she finds her apartment door open and some lingerie missing from her drawer. Parker is obviously creeped out and concerned about this stalker - yet when Dean takes it upon himself to have a copy made of her apartment key she still can't help but be attracted to him? I don't think so. Dean just came across as a sleazy sexual predator to me. While it could have worked if Bruce had meant for Dean to be a not-nice anti-hero, she is writing him as a straight romantic interest and it did not compute for me.Sorry. The sex scenes were hot; I'll give the book that much. But otherwise this light romantic erotica did not work for me - I could never get past Parker's moral dilemma or Dean's sleaziness.",0

"Fun contemporary romance.  I didn't get into it as much, but it was well-written.  About a woman who ends up going back to Alaska to help out her mom's business.  Lots of small town type personal interactions, and of course, interactions with an ex-boyfriend that causes lots of tension/chemistry.",0
This was an interesting read and I did enjoy it.  It was a little strange at times but overall a good read.,0
"I couldn't get into this book (short story).  My main complaint was if Dana felt enough about her brother to take him in why not try to protect him when a stranger shows up who obviously has an unhealthy, sometimes hostile relationship with this 17 year old boy.  She just allows him move in to her house, invites him to sleep with her brother then has fantasies of a guy that she can't say for sure isn't having a sexual relationship with her underage brother. The only thing I liked was the cover.",0
"I wasn't so sure when I started reading it, but the character's (even though it was a short story) were pretty well written. I enjoyed the story and it was romantic too!",0
As always Sharon sala comes away with another amazing story! Thanks for another great read. They keep getting better and better!,1
"This is a very light, pleasant and humorous story about America and the digital age.  A charming set of characters and how the ""Gizmo"" has affected their lives and the lives of the inhabitants of the small town that holds the Last Bookstore in America.  Truly enjoyable, also ironic that I did read this book on my Kindle!",1
"For the most part this was an acceptable book.  I'm into the ""end of the world"" so I was entralled with the asteroid and how the citizens and world reacted. There were many parts I could have done without - the intricate details of the spacecraft for instance.  I didn't really care about that. Its a spacecraft.  I found several examples of this type of detailing yet leaving out other details that should have been included.**spoiler alert**Like another reviewer I didn't like Maria. Father Jenkins once stated ""she is conniving"" but didn't elaborate nor did it ever reveal what he meant by that.  I agreed and kept waiting for anything, something. Couldn't stand her.  Also, was Todd an idiot? He would have to be, I didn't buy the unconditional love and sexless marriage, maybe if they had been married for 10 years, but as newlyweds, no way.  I didn't like Jesus/Brother Michael - very creepy dude.  Very, very creepy. And his sidekicks and their women, very weird. Who were these morons? Couldn't he have found other disciples? I kept waiting for them to be locked up and put into the psychiatric hospital Maria was in. Who was he representing? Who was the ""father""? I'm guessing it was Satan? Would God really be ok with drug dealing? Torture? Mind Control? Laundering money? Scamming the citizens for their land? etc.  I do not know, I'm not religious, but in my mind - NO, at least not any God that I know of.  I liked Blaze/Father Jenkins until it was revealed he was a pedophile. What the heck was that all about?  What happened to Jim Donohue? He just dropped off the page never to return.  Why was Dr. Perez stalked and murdered? Never cleared that one up either.  What about the ""other girl"" who died in childbirth, how weird was throwing that paragraph in? Shouldn't that have been more detailed?Other than the above I thought it was an interesting storyline, it was quite busy with an asteriod, cloning, prison, creepy miracles, etc.  Fit into my love of cheesy-sci-fi just perfectly.",1
"I thought this was a short story, but ended up being two 2 chapters of a book, and then a start of the next book after it. My husband really loves star wars stuff and he said it would of been great and its not like you are going to lose any money ..well they will cause even if this book is made I WON""T buy it OR SEE the movie.",0
I enjoy reading the Westmorelands in chronological order so buying the books as a bundle will guarantee that you read in sequence.,1
Dr. Leale's report is an historical jewell - Written with careful &#34;Matter of Factness&#34; + an abundance of sensitivity. There was no cost on my Kindle either.  Thank you.,1
"I felt the book was a little slow getting started, and I had just started to get into the story when it was over.  It didn't have a strong hero that I could get behind and root for, and this made it difficult to lose myself in the story, since I didn't really care what happened to them.  It was also very short and had no resolution.  Presumably this will be resolved later, as there are at least 5 parts to this story.  Since I already 'bought' the next installments, I'll keep going, and I hope it will resolve.",0
Enjoyed this book. I have been reading the series. Not a heavy read just a nice story with some twists and turns that keep you reading.,1
Couldn't put it down.a mystery with humor thrown in to make a great story with characters you would like to know that help the police solve murders.,1
This is a VERY short story with little plot or character development.  Same those few minutes it takes to read the entire story and purchase something you can enjoy.,0
"Be aware that this a short story. As I did not read any of the other, apparently longer, books in the series, it was not very satisfying.Basically, Keely and Jack are getting married, and the bride really wants the reception to be over and the wedding night to start. She tries to seduce her husband all the way to the hotel where the two-weeks honeymoon is supposed to take place. He steadfasly resists her, for reasons that made no sense to me. Having your brand-new husband refuse your advances sounds less than romantic ! As a reader, you're also being teased all the way to the bedroom without the big finale.Dumb plot and shortness set aside, the story itself is well written and there are glimpses of humor and interesting characters. I would presume that if I had read any of the Rough Riders books, I would not have been so disappointed.",0
"A cliche. A no brainer. If this is a theme of the authors other books, then I'm glad I wasted my time on this short one.",0
"I'm not really a paranormal reader, but this was free and it sounded intriguing. And so far, the reviews are on both sides. So I decided what the heck. I'm glad I did. I really enjoyed this. As far as being a romance, it doesn't have much conflict in the way of the hero and heroine. In fact, there's almost none, and I found the whole light ball thing a big let down in the end. All that build up and then...nothing. I understand why she chose to do this, b/c she didn't have time to start an apocalypse, but... as a personal preference, I really hate long build ups like that that tease me and then poof, problem neatly solved in the nick of time. Just a personal preference. It's frustrating for me. lol The heroine annoyed me at first. I almost didn't make it through the first chapter, because she acted like a spoiled child, constantly pecking at at Nikos to get his attention, but I did eventually warm up to her. So if you're in the first chapter and you want to throw it agianst the preverbial wall, keep reading. It does get better.And I LOVED Nikos. I'm not usually much for the alpha male. The whole beat your chest thing is usually a huge turn off for me. But he was SEXY. During the sex scenes, she went a little over the top with the expressions for things, often describing the same feeling over and over again in very flowery, over the top language. Just not my style.But overall, I really loved the played between the hero and heroine, loved the heroine's spunky attitude, and it ended up being a very sweet and spicy romance. Great emotion and great description. I really enjoyed this read. I may even look up more books from this author. I like her style.",1
"okay, I bit the bait...downloaded the freebie...and was totally blown away.  I have gotten very disillusioned by the crappy vampire books out there.  This one was going to be the last free download of that genre I ever did.  I greatly enjoyed Two and Theroen's story.  The twists and turns kept me very interested and I read it all in one sitting.  The plot was well thought out, the characters (at least I thought so) were very well developed. I could not wait to get the rest of the series, which I devoured in 2 days...I will be putting Buecheler on my list of authors to read...I loved it!",1
"When I was a child my parents loved these stories - made into several movies - and of course, I thought they were boring and old fashioned.Well, they're still old fashioned, but in a comforting, old world way.  The stories are set in the British Isles for the most part, between WWI and WWII.  Bulldog Drummond makes a habit of saving damsel's in distress with flair and dash.  There's no bad language, course innuendo or explicit sex or violence, just interesting narrative and story lines.  Great for a quiet rainy Sunday.",0
This is the 2nd book in the series and just as entertaining as the first book. Ilook forward to reading another one.,1
"I like reading this genre of books, and this is the first time that I wanted to reach out and slap the characters.  Emily, the ""heroine"" is self-absorbed, out of control and whiny to book.  She is portrayed as a complete slut, unable to make it through the day without sex.  She is seriously without any redeeming attributes...doesn't want to be helpful....willing to do all three brothers on the same day - not because she is interested in a menage - simply because she is apparently constantly horny.  The leap to ""love"" for the brothers and her is non-existant.  They remember a 12 year old child, and BAM - the day she returns they are in love with her.  Talk about a leap of the imagination.  The way the sex was portrayed in this book actually gave me the heebies - and I stated before - I like the concept of menage relationships.  This book was just too unbelievable to swallow.  Yikes.",0
"I just had to edit this review. This book is an (I believe I got this right) an updated re-write. Thank god I didn't get the first version. It has moved into MY top 5 favorite. He (BECHETT DeSAXBY) is also in my top 5 Hero/daydream inducing gents.Didn't expect to like it. Seemed a little too debauched. ha ha ha. I freggin loved it. Matter of fact I'm over 21...well over 21...ran my batteries dead..NOW you know what batteries..I am broadening my reading tastes and buying anything Scottie Barrett writes. AN ABSOLUTE KEEPER (with a large supply of batteries).And for once the cover of that hunk matched the description. You guys can read it premise. What I loved is his portrayal and the FILET MIGNON in depth character study Scottie Barrett did. From the first, with 'Bechett baby' catchin a snooze in the hayloft after an early ""happy ending"" thats AFTER HE WENT OUT AND BROUGHT BACK HIS CASTLE'S meat for the week. At first he seemed like a wastrel. But he's the real deal. In modern times he would be a war hero. He's home from the crusades. He didn't think he would survive. The King suitably and righteously rewards him. He's in his early 30's. Very responsible and loving and enjoyin life. (HELL, I'M WELL OVER 21 AND I'D DO THE SAME THING)He earned it. It's his choice. And he takes it to the max.As I said I'm not doing story premise, but it's about 3 friends. 2 boys and 1 girl. Bechett baby is one of the boys, then his cousin (the other boy) and a girl.They were all raised together. He fell in love with the girl as children. Then life happens. The first scene AFTER he gets her back inside the castle walls...well....hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm.She is tricked into delivering some refreshments to his bedroom..and she walks in on a REAL TREAT! CRIPES MY OWN HEART RATE JUST PICKED UP,HONESTLY! For the faint of heart, she walks in on a Mfff, Ah-hem (can't breath)...she's stuck on stupid..I'm not! I must have read this scene 100 times and it still hasn't gotton old. I can just see his face when he turns around...luv,luv,luved it! So there's my re-wright. I've re-read this 3x's. I've only done that with 3 other books. I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY LOVED THIS ONE. And for those of you whe know me from the other Amazon sites know I'm no shrinkin violet.So those of you who read the 1st version..throw it out..try this! YES YES YES this is a keeper,a heat inducer, and in MY top 5. (Now let's see where did I put my new toy?",1
"No SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: This is a short story that reads like the opening chapters of an over-dramatized paranormal romance. There was some magic: magical ring, legend of werewolves come to life in a whimsical way. Overall, however, it was pretty unsatisfying.SEXUAL CONTENT: While it is labeled as ""erotic"" - there was really only one scene of lust and it was just OK. It was sexy in a desperate kind of way, but felt incomplete.PLOT & CHARACTERS: Not really much plot and the story was so short that pacing was irrelevant. Mostly this was just incomplete. It read like a vignette, not a story. The characters were undeveloped, though the man was intriguing. It might have been fun to get to know him better through a longer story.BOTTOM LINE: This story is one word: HARMLESS. Nothing really to it, but nothing terribly against it except that it was too short. If this had been developed into a real book, it might have turned out to be ""just ok.""

I downloaded this book free for Kindle. I read the reviews and was thinking I would enjoy this book. Boy was I ever wrong! I was so bored with this book because it didn't seem to move out of the bedroom once the main characters made it there. I decided that was enough for me and I was done. I finally deleted this book withoug ever finishing it. I only rated it one star because I could not rate it NO STARS!,0
The cover is beautiful but it is very hard to connect and very hard to release. Not like my other kindle cover for my gen2. It is a breeze to put on and take off.,0

"So maybe I have read too many m&eacute;nage stories but this just story just did not work for me, I realize it is a short story so not a lot of character development or background but to me Cassie just came off as kinda whiny and wimpy....yes you're in love with your two best friends, and yes, you see them getting it on, you obviously were not that good of friends if you ran off with no explanation or confronting them about it (or maybe I am expecting the character to do what I would do which is call them on it...not that I have ever been in love with two people equally or at the same time....) so while I normally like this author this one just did not do it for me, I guess I like my heroines a bit stronger....",0
"I liked the first two Royal Cordova Trilogy's better, but this one is good also.  The princesses were more daring with more drama.",1
"This is a book that can be read on many levels.  It is fun, humorous, and filled with a bit of magic.  Yet it develops the theme of overcoming old wounds which is one I particularly love to read.  I picked it up after reading and liking another book of hers, His Majesty Prince of Toads.The fun premise is a magical brew (a love potion)that is causing all the bachelor's to marry. The Earl of Vailmont doesn't believe the rumors, however, and is determined to prove his theory that there is no magic involved. In typical rouge fashion, he sets out to show his friends that he can associate with women without getting caught. Unfortunately, he chooses Sylvia to experiment with and becomes attracted to her. This pits Val against Sylvia in a game of pursuit as old as time.You can read this for the fun, surface story of magical love potions, lusty protagonists, and fears of marriage and really enjoy this book. You can also read this for the underlying story where both Val and Sylvia have suffered  great losses--loss that has always stood in the way of true happiness and finding love. Though they each approach their losses--betrayal, moral dilemmas, death, in different ways it is that approach and that desire to find love that is for me the real conflict in this story and what puts it above many others in this genre.",1
I definitely feel for Mercedes but I did not like the ending at all. I hate  when books just stop with no real ending.,0
I first picked this up from Harlequin when they rolled out Harlequin Mini.  I really liked being able to pick up a romantic short story...sometimes a quick read is the perfect pick me up.  I enjoyed this quick read by Jane Porter.  I found the pace kept me interested in the every moment of Estrella and Carlo's romance.,1

"Looking at the cover of this book, I wasn't really sure what I was going to find inside. I was both thrilled with the contents and impressed by this author's ability to transport his reader to another world and make you forget yourself while reading his work. This story is amazing. Steve Peek has a unique talent for building believable characters that you can't help but identify with. This story is very complex and has a lot of elements that I had not seen before, and was not at all what I had expected.If you like books that will keep you at the edge of your seat for the entire experience, this is the book to choose. I was particularly fascinated with the way his characters reacted to things. The suspense he manages to build through their uncertainty and terror leaves you half afraid to turn the page, but half afraid not to. This is the type of book that could be adapted into a very exciting movie. The author's descriptions are detailed and bring the book to life before your eyes as though you are watching a film. Here is an example of his descriptive writing:""The house looked as if it had never seen a coat of paint. The gray planks warped and strained against the rusty nails, which bled dark-red streaks from years of rain."" Rather than telling the reader everything that is going to happen step by step, Steve Peek allows us to connect the dots and reveals his story through the actions of his characters.There was no extra fluff or poorly utilized space in this novel.By the time you reach the middle of this book, the pages turn furiously. I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next, but at the same time I hated to see this book be over with. Steve Peek has a real talent for writing, and I look forward to seeing what he comes up with next. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a complex mystery with a measure of terror and truly original and unexpected twists.I received a digital copy of this book for my review. My opinions are my own.",1

I skipped to the end, thinking maybe it ended well.  Nope.  How does this have so many 5-star reviews?  I feel my 2-star rating is generous.I'm glad I got it for free, because I got what I paid for.",0
"The Good:This was a good read with super hot love scenes and a surprisingly sweet premise.  Yes, there's some stuff that's hard to swallow, like that the super handsome hero is a virigin but miraculously knows all these awesome moves, however that's a pretty small part of the story.  I liked the fact that he was sweet and shy and reluctant to approach Jenny, but as soon as he does, sparks fly!The Bad:I honestly could have done without the whole attempted rape scene because it felt forced and unrealistic, but I guess that was really just so we could see why Will ended up the way he did.Bottom line:This is the first book I've read by this author and I'll be checking out more of her work for sure!",1

Great reads. I am still working through them.  Every thing from his travels abroad to stories of his childhood.  Thoroughly entertaining reading...,1
The best thing I can say about this book is that it wasted very little of my time. This author has done better. She would do well to skip the trash talk and the over done sex scenes and focus on the character development and dialogue. The good thing is she does get better than this effort shows.,0
"I decided to give McKenna another try, regardless of my disappointment with Two Sighted. Main reasons, I loved the characters of Jon and TJ from the first book, and, of course, the menage angle is pretty intriguing. I enjoyed the story for this book a lot more than the first. The characters were not as strong as I normally prefer, but the book was a good read and I'm glad I picked it up; although, its priced a bit high for only 100 pgs.",1
"Martha is an empath and because of this a recluse. She buys an antique mirror with strange symbols on it and learns it is not all it appears to be, it leads her to the man of her dreams. Silas is a Scottish wolf shifter who spies Martha and recognizing her as his mate he convinces her to stay with him, then proceeds to capture her heart.The author writes a decent sentence the storyline is cohesive and the dialogue smooth. The steamy scenes were abundant, detailed, and sizzling, but I had some major problems with this book.First, I really don't like when a book goes from zero to one hundred in the first few pages. Martha and Silas were having sex before you even knew anything about their personalities or could form any kind of emotional attachment. Silas remains pretty two dimensional throughout. There was no build up, no flirting, no draw to help you feel the chemistry between them it was disappointing, and there were so many steamy scenes in the beginning that I started skipping through to get to the meat of the story.Second, Silas is described as the usual alpha male big, buff, and bad, most women's ideal fantasy man. Then Martha is described and she is plain and over weight.....now just hear me out. I understand that we all come in different shapes and sizes I am not perfect either but this is fantasy, so when I read I am visualizing the scene as the author describes it, why would I want to fantasize about a beautiful man having sex with an over weight unattractive woman. I want to leave the reality outside of my books, authors never design the lead man as scrawny, plain, and timid....that's because women wouldn't like it. I get that she is trying to appeal to the audience by saying here is a hot guy going for the everyday women, but throughout the book Martha is describing herself, an introvert with plain looks, hair, and an over weight figure and coming to terms with the fact that Silas doesn't care, but to me it disturbs the romance of the book....it's a turn off. I felt as though Martha really didn't like herself, so guess what I had a hard time liking her as well. If you are going to have a character described as less than ideal I would accept it much better if she were confident with what she has, not insecure. Make her big, sassy, and proud.Lastly, there really wasn't much to the book other than steamy scenes and that became tiresome if you took those out it would be a very short novella, so if you want an unemotional erotic romance then this book is for you. This is my first read by this author so maybe her other books are different, better? I got this for free and would be hard pressed to purchase any of her other books or continue this series. Enjoy!",0
Steal Me is a short story with an exciting beginning and continues to thrill the reader with sensual actions and adventures.  The characters are strangers that intrigue each other and the chase is on.  The conflict she is independent and is not easily sway by the charms of a dark handsome delicious male species until he turns the tables and schemes to captured her attention. In all an enjoyable read that tingles the senses and stimulates the mind.,1
"At the time that I started purchased this series directly from Ellora's Cave starting back in 2008 - I would have given most of the novels in this series a 5* but considering that the author never finished the series - I really would not recommend to even start.This is actually the last full novel in the series.Jaid Black started doing &#34;side&#34; short stories giving them a .5 number.  Just like the book that is now listed as #6 in the series - originally was 1.5 short story.  Novel #6 was supposed to be about Kyra's younger sister (Kara) - the missing sister that Kyra's daughter is named after and the continuation of the hunt for the missing girls.  Even before the author stopped writing in this series - she had switched to only publishing novella's that were side stories and not part of the ongoing story.  I would definitely not recommend that anyone purchase what is now listed as #7 - Never A Slave because it does not add anything to the unfinished series.The novels are okay but go into it with your eyes wide open and with the understanding that there will be no resolution to the mystery or the missing girls after the 5th book.  Also, the novellas are totally overpriced and can be skipped.",0
"I was misled to believe that there would be gay content in this book. There was none. Sure, the erotic plots were hot but there was no M/M. Found out that the M/M part appeared in the third book; not this one.",0
Not a bad quick read but nothing special.  Still ok for a quick fun shifter story with a good dose of steamy sex,0
"Here I am again, reviewing another of Lanyon's novella-length stories and once again, I can't express strongly enough my appreciation for his technical skill, his intelligence and wit with a plot and characters, and his ability to draw me into the world with strong, believable happenstance. And in The Dickens With Love, Lanyon shines especially bright for adding a surprising amount of depth and backstory to the lead character, James Winter. Novella's are often hampered by their very nature, but in this, Lanyon rose above those limitations to provide an exceptionally well rounded character. His romantic lead, a Mr. Sedgwick Crisparkle, was perhaps NOT so fully defined and fleshed out, but was still superior to many two dimensional characters in novella-length stories.Add in a sweet holiday melancholy and yearnings for respectability once had and now lost and a measure of growth for James' character, and this lovely tale just shines like one of those starburst or starlight drinks Sedge favors so much. Which sounded delicious by the way...if a bit monsterously strong. The ""excerpts"" from the ""Christmas Cake"" were charming little surprises that lent an air of reality to the story as well. As I've said in a previous review of a novella-length Lanyon story, the only critique I truly have is that the romantic aspects of this m/m holiday romance don't quite touch me on as deep an emotional level as I'd hoped, but I still believe that's more due to the limiting nature of the length of the story than any failure on Lanyon's part. I admit...I'm cynical and don't believe in love developing within days or hours, so when the story spans such a time, it's hard for me to buy into a love-at-first-Dickens whirlwind romance.But top-notch storytelling, as always, for Lanyon.",1
This one although based in a different part of the state carried the theme along and was another that held my attention all the way through.,1
"I  thought a book was more than 10 pages long.  At best this was a interesting short story. I guess I had better check more closely before ordering, what I expected to be, a book. I'm almost afraid to order Beyond Justice.",0
"Very rare do I find myself not finishing a book. Unfortunately I decided that this one just didn't hold my attention. I did however do my best and read up to 92% but while searching Amazon I found that there was other books I'd rather read, so I put this one down & have decided I'm in no hurry to pick it back up and finish that last 8% anytime soon.There was allot of pages that were filled with just.......useless story telling. a few little stories all in there that just didn't mesh together. Like she had 100 different ideas and used them all but had no real thought to why they should go together. You can try and put chemistry and romance in a book but for a reader to actually feel it....well Lori missed it on this on!!",0
"I really enjoyed reading book two about Jane Porter, Antonio Villereal & Santos as well as Lily Tyler & Jan Jacqueas at the big birthday bash at the mansion that Antonio's step-brother Dirk through for him. Jane and Lily are business partners in an event planning company called R.S.V.P., and they are helping host the big lavish massacred/BDSM weekend. Lily is the on-call girl for the weekend but Jane is required to help out before each event takes place, assuming she is not other wise engaged. It seems that the birthday boy Antonio has snagged her attention along with his BFF santos and they are keeping her completely distracted, so much so that she misses the breakfast brunch and the dinner sit-down. Read this book because just like the first book it's a scorcher. You will be wet from start to finish, and you won't want to miss reading book 3 or 4.",1
"Plot/Story/Characters: 2 StarsThis is a very short story. It felt more like the first couple of chapters of a book rather than a complete story.  It was all about setting up the background for a good yarn, and then it cut short. There was no resolution, the climactic scene was a girl-fight including hair pulling, and there was no character development or growth. Readers were introduced to Zyra and her arch nemesis, then left hanging. It feels like an unfinished story, not a cliffhanger, just not finished. The quest was not completed, no portion of the quest was completed.Writing Style:  4 StarsThe language used was normal for a science fiction novel. It flowed well, and was easily understandable.Overall 3 stars, I wish there had been more to the story it felt so lacking.This book was previously rated at redadeptreviews.com",0
"NO SPOILERS or plot summaries.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 in a sci-fi erotica series set in Earth's relatively near future. This book shows no respect for women whatsoever. While there were definitely some very hot scenes, this was an irritating story. It was very well written, but it was well written garbage. Unfortunately, the ENTIRE plot sequence was based on the inability of the main characters to have an adult conversation. Every single thing that went wrong could have been avoided if they sat down and TALKED. And I was unable to enjoy the fabulous sex scenes because it basically amounted to rape: NO MEANS NO, even if there are pheromones involved that cause unwanted arousal. I just wanted to cry every time they started fooling around because all I could think of was how desperately Olivia DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH HIM.CHARACTERS: Told from both characters' first person perspective, we got to know them both pretty well. One saving grace to this story is that Baird, the male lead, was actually a very sympathetic character when I was reading his perspective- even if he was an arrogant idiot- but from her perspective, he was awful. I really wanted to like him, but his complete inability to respect Olivia's wishes and talk to her like an adult just made me want to beat the crap out of him. Olivia was also almost likeable, except that she was also unable to just address things head on with Baird. One example: Baird decided to FORBID Olivia from leaving the room, rather than just bloody explaining to her the dangers of going out without him, and Olivia just acted sarcastic and rebellious instead of bothering to ASK WHY. For goodness sakes, people, Darwin's Law applies here.PLOT: Decent enough set up for a sci-fi erotica and would have made for a fantastic story if it had been handled differently. Instead of two rational adults- who could have acknowledged their attraction and then tried to find a way to make it work- we ended up with selfish, immature fools who spent their time fighting and alternately lying to each other and teasing each other. Also, there was absolutely NO ROOM made in the plot for Baird to make any compromises to accommodate Olivia- it was all about Olivia sacrificing her entire life for him. He was just supposed to convince her it was a good idea. Yeah- I guess the concept women's liberation never made it into our future.BOTTOM LINE: This was infuriating at best and offensive at worst. In fact, I'd call this book a travesty mainly because the author clearly has serious writing talent. The writing itself was very well done- the sex was very erotic, the characters very sympathetic- but because the actions and events were based on STUPIDITY it just made it painful to read. If you're the kind of person who likes a story about a woman who finds a man who is willing to worship her physically and you're not worried about whether she manages to maintain her own life, then you might like this. But if you're the kind of person who thinks keeping a woman locked up in the bedroom for the rest of her life is offensive, avoid this like the plague.",0

"This book was not as good as Where There's A Will....  I finished it but got bored with Maggie being so stubborn and insisting to be included in the investigation.  Her reasons given to be included were lame.  I really thought this would be a good series to follow, and good books/author to read, but not so.  I'm not sure I'll buy more books from this author... especially about Maggie.",0
"I love On the Edge! Meeting Brett, Leo and Lisa through the out of the box series made me want to know soo much more about these characters. If you haven't read the out of the box set, On the edge is a great introduction to what you will get a whole lot more of in the rest of the series. HOT scenes between the trio, and the different combinations of duos too. I just reread the story again, and the second time around it is still as good as the first... now seriously thinking about reading the rest of them again too :P I love the personalities, and they all play off of each other in great ways. Thanks Kallysten for continuing to keep me aroused, entertained, and eagerly awaiting what ever series instalment you have coming out next. :)",1
"There are twenty-nine stories in this collection. These Indian tales resemble the stories that flourished in Europe, such as the tales by the Brothers Grimm and by Aesop, although they have an Indian flavor. The collector of these stories contends that they are very old, older than the legends and folk-tales that later flourished in Europe. He believes that India was the originator of this genre and the stories were possibly brought to Europe by the crusaders or other travelers that passed through India.For example, the tale The Lion and the Crane is well-known. A lion was eating an animal when a bone got stuck in its throat. A crane offered to help if the lion promises not to eat it. The lion agrees. The crane protects itself by placing a stick in the lion's mouth to keep it open while he is inside the lion's mouth removing the bone. As soon as the crane removes the bone, it pushes out the stick and flies off to a high tree. Later, the crane asks the lion what the lion will give it for saving the lion's life. The lion responds that it already gave the crane a gift by not eating it. The Indian version ends by speaking about the transmigration of souls, a belief of many Indians. The lion and the crane were people in another life.How the Raja's Son Won the Princess Labam is another example of a familiar tale, although known in the west under other names. A prince goes in search for a beautiful princess. While journeying, he takes out his food and finds an ant in it. He places it on the ground for other ants to come and finish it. The ant Raja arrives and tells him that since he fed the ants, if he needs help in the future all he need do is think of them and they will come to help him. He leaves and continues searching for the princess. He comes across a tiger with a thorn in its paw. He helps the tiger who tells the prince that if he needs help in the future, he should think of him, and he and his wife will come and help him. The prince continues his search and comes across four fakirs with four magic items: a bag that give food whenever it is requested to do so, a bowl that offers water, a bed that flies and can take the prince where he wants to go, and a stick that will beat any group that tries to harm him. He takes the four items from the fakirs. He uses the bed to go to the princess. He uses the bag and bowl for food and drink. He then uses the ants and tigers and the bed when the princess' father insists that he performs tasks before he will give up his daughter. The final fourth task that the father insists that he perform is one that none of his friends or magical items can help him with. But the princess tells him how to do the task. The story ends by stating that the two lived happily and never needed to use the magic stick.",1
"I usually don't write ""I hated it"" reviews, but I'm a little stunned that I could be so misled by several reviewers that I usually trust. I'm angry that I spent money on something so sloppy, and that others have rated it so well.This book is horribly written, and even more badly edited. The plot is full of holes and improbabilities and the dialog is often cringe-worthy. The characterizations are one-dimensionally flat and largely unlikeable. I've read far better from Glenn.Needless to say, I will not be reading any more in this series, and I will be much more careful trusting others' reviews.",0
"This is a nice little read, and it's at a great price.  :O)Jim gets an e-mail from someone he went to school with and she thinks someone is stalking her, and has sent her threatening e-mails. She contacts Jim for help, but before he can respond, she's killed.  He feels he needs to find out who killed her, and why. As the story unfolds, Jim learns that someone is killing people from his High School, and he has to find out who the other targets are and why.  Jim soon finds a connection, then the killer sets his sights on Jim.I really liked the characters of Jim and his biker friend, Buck. They both seem down to earth and life life. This also has other wonderful characters.I really liked the writing style. The author has a nice style that keep the story moving at a steady pace and not to much fluff.",1
"Described as ""a collection of short stories told from a different character's involvement and point of view,"" this is actually a linnear novella in which the POV changes from chapter to chapter. None of it was particularly great. Just a very surface description of some bloody conflict between the seelie and unseelie courts during a fancy ball, with almost no background, engaging characterizations, or engaging dialogue.I acquired this some months ago, and in the meantime Farrell has released a novel based on it, entitled Soul. I believe it was only after the publication of Soul that this shorter work began to be listed as a ""Prequel companion"", and it's not exactly that, as the events described in it mirror events that take place in Soul.In my opinion, having now read two novels and two ""short story collections"" (one of which actually was a short story collection!) by Farrell, as well as the first chapter of Soul, perhaps Farrell should stick to novels. The longer format provides the obviously-needed room to develop interesting characters. One Night with the Fae lacks in this area, and pretty much reads like an author's outline for a longer work.",0
"In Chicago, her five overly protective older brothers and her Italian parents are driving Lottie Santori crazy as they leave her with no breathing room.  Being the only female and the youngest, she enjoys any opportunity to escape from their constant vigil.  Thus she looks forward to her out of town work in Trouble, Pennsylvania to conduct on site research into a serial killer who owned Seaton House though she doubts she will find any sexual relief in the small town.At Seaton House, Lottie meets new owner Simon Lebeaux, who inherited the old hotel from his late uncle.  She immediately revises her thoughts that Trouble means abstinence.  However, several accidents occur including some near fatal ones as if someone wants to prevent Lottie from completing her assignment.  Simon thinks the hotel is haunted, but Lottie believes a mortal person wants her stopped.The sequel to the amusing contemporary HERE COMES TROUBLE is a delightful investigative romance in which the lead couple explores the haunting of the hotel and their hearts.  The story line contains plenty of action, but it is the lead couple who keeps it focused and entertaining as she knows what she wants (sex not a lasting love) and he knows she is trouble (he has enough tsuris without her).  The trouble with this novel is that Leslie Kelly will keep her audience up late reading in one sitting.Harriet Klausner",1
"I throughly enjoyed The Selection series, but thought this novella was a bit of a letdown even though you have a glimpse into the restrictive life of the Prince as seen through his eyes. In this story Maxon's relationship with Daphne seems to be all one-sided, although the story does give a further glimpse into his relationship with his manipulative father and his view on love and finding a wife. The story's only redeeming quality was to reveal Maxon's stifling lifestyle and his need to gain control over his own life. This was probably most apparent in his perception of the Selection, his meeting with America and his need to review the candidate files. I don't think you need to read the novella to understand the Prince, although it was entertaining.",0
Wonderful story. Short but sweet. It is so nice how they meet again. A small lie of ones name can mean something big to someone. A good read even if it was too short.,1

"The novel may be missing sections in the kindle edition.  Characters are put into play without clear introduction and the story jumps without transitions.  On one page she is leaving to go to Gran's, the next she is in bed having sex with her ex.  I gave up a third of the way into the book.  I was not interested in the characters and the story wasn't engaging enough to warrant a greater investment of time.",0
"So disappointing.  Of course the title should have been a dead give-away but I took a chance on it anyway.  This time, it didn't pay off for me.  I didn't get very far into the ""story"" before I said, ""That's it, I'm done"".  I immediately dumped it!!!  Even free, it wasn't worth putting that kind of junk in my mind.  I think I missed the warning on the information page, because I went back and just saw it.  Two strangers immediately jump into bed and have sex, that was so explicit!!  Come on where was the story?

"Yes.  I knew this was a short romance story when I bought it for 99 cents. Sorry,  but this story was too short.  I would hardly call this a romance.  It was missing sooo much.  Also some of the things they said we're very stupid. Ugh,  What a waste.",0
"Jake McBride is a self-made millionaire and womanizer extraordinaire. Emily Taylor is his efficient, smart, mousy, oh-so-uptight personal assistant.They have the perfect working relationship. Jake depends on Emily for everything, and Emily pretends to respect him. But then the unthinkable happens. Emily decides to branch out into the world of dating (as only the efficient, practical, and pragmatic would ever dream of doing) and somehow, Jake notices Emily is actually a woman. Not only does he notice, but it appears that every guy around has taken notice as well and Jake decides that he has to save Emily from herself and all the horny men of New York, who are all too willing to take advantage of his naive assistant.When Ms Marton gets it right, there is no Harlequin author better. How she is able to make these two characters (with their personalities) believable and engaging is beyond me. That she also manages to make them relatable and likable is a feat worthy of praise. I loved Jake, I loved Emily, and I loved all their little quirks and idiosyncrasies.I loved even more that I was able to laugh, get turned on, and get choked up all in 184 pages. By the last page I couldn't help but hold a hand to my chest and go 'Awww'. It's everything these short, quick reads are supposed to be. Thoroughly entertaining.",1
Save the world...This is the story of Count who has been gifted a magical shield in order that he can save humankind.  The various characters throughout the book are all well done.

"At first I thought I would really enjoy this novel and there are elements about it which weren't too bad - the magical parts - but the heroine spoiled most of it for me. She comes across as shallow and a real twit.I know she had to get into the woods to fulfil the story but getting drunk, deliberately running out in the middle of the night and getting chased by The Beast was just plain silly. It was reminiscent of those old-time movies where the ""feisty"" girl reporter is told not to go into the cellar and of course, the first thing she does is just that. Izzy, told not to go into the woods by just about everyone she meets, does just that too.The characters were not ""fleshed out"" sufficiently for me to have much sympathy for them - we know next to nothing about Feathers, the son, Connor, or his father, Joe (who turns out to be an elf) or the abusive ex-boyfriend/husband/partner. His threats and leaving mutilated animals on her doorstep is not taken very seriously by the police.There is no back story to speak of which would explain the circumstances of Izzy's life - a few letters to her rellies is all the reader gets. The ending was abrupt and the last chapter jumps forward a year without explaining what's going on with Izzy, Feathers and Connor. It's as though the author couldn't decide how to finish it and opted for the easiest way out.I abhore novels where animals are killed so that made me very distressed. It is not necessary and seems to indicate that the author has no problem with animal abuse. I may be being unfair to her here, but that's the way it came across to me.I would not recommend this novel for that reason alone.",0
"Despite what the blurb would have you believe, this story does not tell of a flirtation or romance that occurred before Maxon's Selection. There is a very brief beginning in which a young French royal friend of Maxon's (what? I thought he had no friends? Whatever.) sort of throws herself at Maxon and he declines. The story immediately moves to the beginning of the Selection and into familiar territory. All we really read is Maxon's perspective of that familiar story and his interaction with the girls. The only interesting bit in my opinion was getting to see why he sent some of the girl's home during the breakfast ceremony. We also see his first interactions with Kriss, and I guess that was kinda interesting. I still can't give it three stars because I feel that the blurb was very misleading and teased the buyer with something it didn't deliver. Asking us to pay a few more dollars for basically the same exact story told through Maxon's eyes felt cheap and disrespectful. I had planned to buy The Queen but if it is really just a retelling of The One through Queen Amberly's eyes then I might read it, but I sure won't pay for it.Buyer Beware.",0
"After reading the other reviews I purchased this title and was disappointed.  This isn't a different story and the characters were poorly developed.  The slaves at Cascade (and in this society), don't ""choose"" to be slaves in the sense that they have options.  Generally, in this society if you don't have a job or training you become a slave.  Alex, is an anomaly in that he one of the few who chooses slavery because of his specific sexual needs and he is older-47 years old.  He has a trade, makes a living but his submissive nature calls him to slavery.  His situation is very different than most of the other slaves we meet:  Noah, Jackson, and Gavin.  Gavin's experience as a slave led him to refuse to even consider owning a slave until Alex comes along.  And this is a huge problem in the continuity of the character development of Gavin.  Alex is the first slave he's trained who is actually choosing to become a slave when he has more attractive alternatives (from Gavin's point of view).  As a result, he's overprotective, holds back and goes ""easy"" on Alex while trying to convince him that slavery is the wrong choice for him.  None of this makes sense-why does Gavin choose to help out the one person who is looking forward to becoming a slave and would happily go with any of the men who take him for a test drive-the rougher the better.  One would think that he would have chosen, before this point,  to help out someone in dire straits-terrified, young, no options, but not Gavin he waits until someone comes to him who has options, is old enough to make a decision and indeed has thought about it and is only offering a 6 month contract so if this gig doesn't work out he can go back to his trade.  Very different than many of the other slaves we meet who have years of slavery to look forward to-again it would make more sense to help one of those people out.I did enjoy the relationship between Sam and Gavin, it was friendly and loving but given that they both had dominant natures I found it very odd, and hard to believe, that they didn't have a third in their relationship, someone very submissive to offset their dominance.  Sure, for the most part Sam let Gavin dominate him, but he wasn't really satisfied with that-as we see in the scene with Jackson when Demetri says ""how have you lived without this""?  I think, as readers, we're supposed to understand that this has been missing from Sam and Gavin's relationship and Alex's presence in their home would provide this. But again, that person did not have to be a slave. Alex would have been happy to go to Michael, Demetri even Brian and Rhys.  He wasn't looking for love, he wanted to be hurt and any of those men would have been happy to provide that.  I thought it was hilarious when they called Alex ""boy"" he was 47 years old for crying out loud!So the big conflict-Gavin not wanting to own a slave because he hated his time in slavery made no sense because Alex wanted to be a slave and Gavin worked as a fricking slave trainer, he had no problem, no conflict with his job.  And he was acting like an owner because he was totally ignoring Alex's desires.  Sam's arguments in favor of Alex making his own choices were good ones, but he was a fricking slave owner.  He only stopped owning slaves when he hooked up with Gavin-he had no problem using slaves whether or not they choose to be in the situation or not.  I felt like the author was trying to write Sam and Gavin as empathic and fair and totally missed the mark-they were poorly fleshed out and delusional.However, Alex was consistent and well developed.  The character of Demetri was fascinating.",0

"I think the writer will improve in time, but she rushed to publish.It is apparent, due to the massive typos and long-winded paragraphs.There is action, full force, nearly each sentence.The story is all over the place and fails to make any type of plotline stick out in the reader's mind.In short, this book has potential, but it simply wasn't ready for publication.Yes, there is a girl in a love triangle, but that is so over-done.The attempt at creating a fantasy world was the best thing this author had going for the story.There were all types of creatures, interacting and causing drama, but the main Heroine Rae~just couldn't fill the necessary duties as Protagonist for me.Again, I do believe this writer will improve in time.  She should keep right on writing!",0
"Heather Killough-Walden is a very creative and daring writer. She makes great dialogue, unexpected twists, memorable and lovable characters (even the antagonists), and all her plots are very well written.  I've been following her for years, along with other fans who discovered her in some of the first websites she contributed to.  Like many of them, and those who have found her through recommendations, she has quickly became the top ""favorite"" and to me the main reason why I kept on going back to those websites, waiting for the next installments to her stories which are always in the fantasy or sci-fi realm, although sometimes they were also very sensual.The Chosen One is one of her fantasy novels, and it's full of dark magic, mystery and suspense.  You will fall in love with the characters, and it will keep you wishing that there is more to the story and that you will get to know the other minor characters more.  (Maybe in the next books then. Right, Heather?) It's exciting, provocative, thrilling, and over-all it's a hell of a ride.  Enjoy it, and along with the rest of us, keep on bugging the author to produce more stories like this especially those about the characters that we already fell in love with.Keep them coming Heather!",1
I really enjoyed this account of the sinking of the titanic. My heart really went out to the people on the ship and what they had to go through and experience. I especially enjoyed the accounts of people who were there and their thoughts and fears and their emotions as they were going through the trauma and they were trying to make sense of what was going on. I can't imagine having such an awful experience. My heart broke for the women who had to leave their husbands not knowing if they would ever see them again. I do wish more was said about the people on the lower decks but I suppose that maybe not much is known about what happened to them and maybe no one really wants to remember or address that issue. This was a very interesting book to read and I did enjoy it.,1
"This book is the third in the Rachel Myers series.  The author develops Rachel even further, giving readers a better understanding of her.  Once again, the descriptions of the mountains, Rachel's gardens, the woods, rivers and all of the surroundings are so beautiful and refreshing.  Although the books in this series are all mysteries and have murder in them, the focus of the books is on the characters and the area, not on the violence. Rachel's love interest in Detective Barnett moves forward.  I am really enjoying this series, and I highly recommend these books.  The only thing that makes me happy when I finish a book is the knowledge that the next in the series awaits me.",1
"I love this short novel about Blake West and Willow Gregory.  My only complaint is that I wish it had been longer!  The story is complete, but  I enjoyed getting to know these characters so much that I didn't want it to end.I loved Blake in his earlier appearances in Lorelei James' Rough Riders series.  He seemed like a genuinely nice guy and this book reinforces that.  Blake is sweet, charming and seriously HOT!!  He's at loose ends and helping out a buddy by looking after his bar while he takes some time off.  He isn't sure what he wants to do with the rest of his life.  He meets Willow, the former Miss Firecracker, when she gets &#34;cherry-bombed&#34; and does some damage to his bar.  She works in the family construction business and thinks of herself more as one of the guys than as an attractive, sexy woman.  The two click instantly and...you'll just have to read it yourself to find out what happens next!",1
"Aislinn's story is a touching one, full of hope and pain, high aspirations and sweet romance.  This book follows her trials as she fights to become a female knight, the first in her kingdom.  Though she meets her share of bullies, those on her side are loyal friends who help her through it all (when she'll let them).  Aislinn is a strong little girl, determined, and willing to do whatever it takes to become a lady knight.Zoltack creates a vibrant world that allows the reader to forget what century they're living in.  The kingdom and castle were made very real to the reader.",1
I have yet to be disappointed by Ms. Andrews.  I enjoyed this world and its sister story silver shark.  Mostly because I like reading a series of connected stories that tie in with each others characters and worlds.,1
"This reminded me of a cross between Dave Barry's Big Trouble and It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.  Don't be mistaken, Alan Hutcheson has his own brand of talent and shows it off in Boomerang.  This is a funny, convoluted tale of mystery and mayhem.  It's a mad dash to see who can get to the boomerang first.  Why?  The Boomerang contains detrimental CIA secrets.  I'll try to sum it up:  Ted is a jazz musician but his guitar, Sarah, is in the window of a pawn store. In order to get some cash to spring her Ted teams up with Jerry for an assignment from the AABC an unofficial branch of the government.  The assignment is to get the boomerang... but so many things can go wrong with such a simple assignment.  Things like a crazy pair of Australian sisters, an insane assassin who carries a crossbow, a cheerleader who rarely wears clothes, and a senator or two.  I strongly recommend you follow Ted and Jerry (I kept wanting to say Tom and Jerry!) on this adventure.  You will laugh the whole way.",1
It is rare that I purchase a book and then give up on it. REALLY rare. This is one of those very few examples. Her style of writing frustrated me no end and I wanted to give up a long time before I finally did. Never again!,0
"suprised by the effect of this book. I like reading about these three. there were some really hot scenes about the two guys  and then of them with her but, also one about rejection of affections. pretty strange how they shared all of the responsibilities of the business and house. I find it hard to believe you could share your lover but, I like reading about it!",1
"Rating 4 1/2 starsI received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated in any way.Brett Andrews has an apartment above his club.  And Lisa is waiting for him.  This is a great way to start off this story.  Leo is an old friend of Lisa&#8217;s that&#8217;s come to the club.  The ending will leave you wanting to read more about this trio and having more of the club experience.Kallysten feeds on her reader&#8217;s need for a sexy vampire &#8211; especially for those of us that are female.  She paints a great picture of what happens when new meets old.  There&#8217;s nothing dark or sinister about what this group has.  If you&#8217;ve never read this author before, why not try this series.  If you love sexy, erotic, vampire short stories you can&#8217;t go wrong by reading Kallysten.  She&#8217;s a great author that knows how to pack a lot in just a few pages.  She never disappoints her readers.",1
"the story is so worth reading.  it has humor, saddiness, anger and on.  Tom n Nora fall in love, with its biggest behind them.  I only wish is to see what happen in the future. l can only imagine lots of spanking, and mostly love.  hugs",1
"This was a cool little story.  It was engaging, interesting, and pretty original.  But I also found it seriously lacking an authentic voice.  Meaning that the author writes the story as a narration alternating between all of the characters, the main characters being two ten-year-olds, and one five-year-old, and the thought process of all three are just not believable.  I thought many times as I was reading that it seemed more like an adult reminiscing about his childhood, and projecting logic and maturity onto the characters that would simply not be possible at their ages.  I was also pretty disappointed with the ending, as the author seems to just get bored with the story, and ends it without much care.  Overall it was a fun, quick read, but I'm very glad I got it for free.",0
I liked that the H stuck to his gun and was serious about getting back with his wife.  Worth it.,0
"With an ingenious plot and sympathetic characters, Falling in Love Again is an entertaining light read.  There's a dash of humor, a strong romance, and a nicely woven plot with good tension between the protagonists.Mallory and John meet on their wedding day.  Mallory is only sixteen and John just a few years older, they are uncertain of each other and resentful as their parents have arranged their marriage.  John must marry Mallory so she can keep her beloved castle and John marries Mallory out of duty (he does not want to see her lose her home) and out of a need to please his father, a man who publicly claims John but privately eschews him because he is not really his flesh and blood.The day after the wedding John leaves and joins the military determined to forge his own destiny and not the one dictated by his father.  Over the years he sends Mallory funds through his uncle but basically lives his own life without laying eyes on his wife.  He returns to England and is a sought after lover and quite the man about town.Mallory finds John in London, in his mistress's house no less, demanding a divorce.  She has lost her home to creditors and she is infuriated at her husband.  John is astounded to see Mallory and even more surprised to learn that she has no home and that he is deeply in debt.  Seems his uncle has been siphoning off his funds and even worse loan sharks are circling him.  John knows he could go to debtor's prison if he does not find his uncle who has conveniently skipped town.  As his wife, Mallory could suffer the same fate so they now are on the run.John's friend lands them a job on one of his family estates, John will become a steward while his friend hunts down his uncle.  Mallory agrees to this plan mostly because she feels she has no choice, she wants to avoid prison.At first it was almost impossible to like John; he was selfish and irresponsible.  Mallory is completely justified in her feelings.  Their time as estate managers brings out the best of both characters and also their insecurities.  John realizes he is self centered and thoughtless; Mallory confronts her lonely life and takes a hard look at her reserved manner with commoners.  John is likable, smooth and smart and best of all sincere, when he feels something he does not hold back.  Mallory is more cautious, after all she was the abandoned one in the marriage and she is also uncertain in social situations, she lacks John's natural charm.  She gets beyond these hindrances and grows into a much more confident woman.  As she understands her husband her heart opens to him more each day.  This is a sweet romance about discovery, the leads not only discover how much they love each other but they also discover how to become better people too.",1
It was a good easy reading book it held my attention very well i love horror books and mystery books,0
"This is a cute story. Characters are interesting. It would have been nice to have had a few of them more filled out, such as Charlene, Myrtle and Gary.  I would have liked to learn more of Debra and Maddox's background. Bottom line what bothered me most was way too little story for way too much money.",1
"Nice story. Nice characters. The problem is that too much of the story is told passively. Rather than experience things actively through the characters we are told about it in declarative sentences, leaving everything at something of a distance.It's a nice book, but far from St. John's best. Better works of hers includes Joe's Wife and Land of Dreams.",0
"Delightful, refreshing reading -- nothing lurid, just relaxing reading. Written in a time different than today, but still fascinating in its simplicity.",1
"Stephanie Bond has definitely impressed me with her writing and particularly her character development. I fall in love with her characters almost immediately, and this book was no exception. Enjoying a laugh while wondering just how the main characters would solve their work and personal dilemmas was icing on the cake. Although the title might steer non-Southerners from feeling compelled to read it, the small town flavor of this book could reflect life in any small town in America.",1
I read all three books and they were entertaining but very slow to develop.  Once you get where your being led you not suprised.  I lost Intrest several times and had to leave it and come back.  The good new is that it was no charge.  I guess you get what you pay for,0
"There is more to Brittany than meets the eye and Charlie is going to be lucky enough to see it...if Brittany will let him.  Brittany has a past that holds her back from anything more than meaningless flings.  Charlie wants to see past Brittany's appearance but she's holding back.After winning the lottery Brittany and he two best friends hire Charles to help manage their winnings.  After going on a few shopping sprees, Brittany has decided to take a chance and do something good with her money.  Charlie is thrilled until she starts asking questions about his sex life.  After a hot meeting in his office, neither of them can stop thinking about the other.  Will Brittany be able to let go and let Charlie love her or will she walk away from what could be true love?This is the first in a three book series and I love it.  We get to meet Brittany and her two best friends after they won the lottery.  They have hired Charlie to help but soon Charlie and Brittany have a passionate interlude that leaves them both wanting more.  This story is hot, hot, hot!  Be warned (personally it's a good warning if you're like me) this is erotica and there is lots of hot, well described sex in this book.  But the most important thing is that there is romance and a good plot as well.  I love the switch between POV.  I always enjoy knowing what both characters are thinking.  There is a HEA here so you don't have to worry about that.  Lol  You might as well buy books two and three when you get this one because you are definitely going to want to read those immediately after finishing this one.",1
"this is a great short story about Ava and Luke, Ava is best friends with Luke's sister Jen and has been in love with him since high school but thinks he would never like her. Luke has wanted Ava just as long but neither has said anything. When the truth comes out about how they feel about each other there's no looking back. This is how a short story should be written the story line and pace worked great for this novella and though not long I cared about everyone in the book. The Ending of this book was great, I would defiantly read books from Anne Rainey again.",1
This is such a great read. Ms Hill wrote such a great story mixing  service to humanity and Christian values without getting preachy.Very exciting and holding your attention until the very end. Just loved this story.,1
"I was not sure I was going to like this book, but it was great! The characters are complex,and the story has many twists. I found Sara to be fascinating. It was a wonderful read.",1
"This story would have been a much better story without all the cursing, I would not recommend this story to anyone and its not a Christian book!!!",0
"I like books that keep you on your toes but this is ridiculous!  I mean come on at least be a little realistic.  First of all people no matter how nice they are aren't that trusting.  And the back and forth between Jesse and Sarah just made my head hurt not want for more.  But even with all the switches between hating each other and being in love I could have like this book if I had known what the auther was saying.  Even having a dictionary on the kindle doesn't make it easy to look up all the different words used, in the end I just made up my own meanings for the words.  I really think that if the auther used less language came back down to earth and remembered the words used by everyday people he/she could write a really good book.",0
"The story begins with an accident and a man working to save some people. He loses two but manages to help a boy and the woman he had promised to protect. We head to the hospital and find out that Dr. Wes Atherton and Katherine were on a date despite her being affianced to a man awaiting her in the states. Wes calls her mother and despite that he has fallen for Katherine he even calls her fianc&eacute; who is apparently cheating on her. After some time and some news, Katherine ends things with her fianc&eacute; and stays with Wes in his home in London while she continues to recover. Things progress to where she and Wes fall in love, but it seems the fates want to keep them separated or kill one of them.The story follows through a few near death experiences while Wes comes to terms in believing two siblings (Jennifer and Will) about some paranormal reaper. He has to allow his mind to accept that although he is a psychiatrist by trade, not all things are as finite as he thought. The story is well written and keeps you hooked. Between your happiness in some cases, fear in other, sadness for loss in a few, and joy for the ending; you can't help but read it through to the end. Definitely give it a go.",1
"This 8,000 worded thriller, tackled by two authors no less, completely took me by surprise. In reading, that is always a good thing. Not only is the premise fresh, quick and straight to the action; it compels you to read faster.The story is simple. Your elders always said don't pick up strangers, they may be psycho's. They also said don't get in to any stranger's car. They may be wacko's as well. But what happens when two killers meet, thinking that the other one is their next intended victim. Well, I don't know about you, but I think that makes for a great Hitchcockian thriller and a feast for the avid reader's eyes. And if you know me by know, you very well know that I am hopelessly addicted to reading.Of course, it was free. But the story was worth a good 5 dollars at least.I give this tale a solid five stars for originality, pacing and it's length.",1
"I decided to buy this book because I had seen come up a few times on my recommended author list.  It was just too short, too boring and didn't really capture my attention.  I guess there wasn't enough heat between the two main characters and the 'love' seemed shallow.  I was disappointed.",0
"I couldn't finish it, after the 2nd story I was so tired of lower case I's, lower cases after periods and lower cases on people's names!!My six year old son can write better than this!",0
Another great set of stories. I almost fall for these guys myself. She makes them unbelievably perfect. Always a smile for how silly princes can be about falling in love.,1
"Short but sweet - has a Victorian widow meet a Wyoming sheriff and instinctively understand that he, like her previous husband, is a dom, and she is a very happy sub. Of course the Sherriff is not as sure as she is, and some tension ensues, but it all works out in the end. This is a light bdsm novel,  but does have some explicit scenes.One thing I'm still stumbling on is how 130 kb translates into page length, but I don't think it's very long at all, this is a short story, not even a novella, but the story is so coherent in itself that I was happy to read it and happy to pay $2.39 for it, but it really reads like an extended magazine article and took maybe 30 mins tops to read. (even if they gave word count, I'd have a better idea of what I was buying.... maybe I'll suggest that next!)",0
"I finished this book in record time.  I enjoyed the first Peacekeeper book very much and this one more.  Even though I went right from book 1 to book 2 I appreciated the synopsis of the book 1 at the beginning.  However,I hate to say it, I didn't enjoy the ""coming attractions"" at the beginning of the book as much.  Even though it didn't give away any of the surprises in the book, I like going from page to page not knowing what's coming next. I've alrleady started book 3 and knew to skim quickly through this part. That said, the characters continued to grow on me and I enjoyed meeting the new peacekeepers, too.  I found myself biting my nails, cheering and crying at different times while reading.  I even snuck in a few pages while at work because I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  I think I've even got my husband hooked!  Now, my only worry is what I'll do when I finish book 5; I've already bought them all (I must read more slowly).",1
"I've never read any of the Quatermain stories, and decided to download this one.  Sure glad I did.  Old-fashioned adventure that turned out to be a real page-turner.  Can't wait to read the earlier stories.",1
"They both actually cheated on their fiance. Even though they were not thrilled of the arranged marriage.Ana and Eric both enjoyed being with their lover..not wanting the lover to know they were engaged.I enjoyed the book, the travel and tourism....a little adventure before the big wedding.",1
"No wonder author claims to have written 250+ books. The thing is a tenth the size of a proper book. The plot is ludicrous, Spoiler (it doesnt spoil anything) the main character is a researcher turns slave arena warrior turned slave brood-cow for alien. Later is rescued by her friends (who tracked her through a sex tape of the alien sex) but told she has been, deemed no longer human, and shoved off to be an official brood crow for the alien race she was previously bred too, in hopes of .... Breeding alien/human hybrids. She accepts this with essentially no protest!!!Guess who she falls for in the end?The first alien she was forced on in the first place.Ok. The plots pretty bad. But I've read worse.  Hard to believe.  at least this did have a plot ...What I'm truly upset about is that I looked forward to reading all the books she says she's written. I was giddy with the idea of 30 new books in a series. And having read this one representative sample I've had to mentally chuck all her works in the OMG crap bin.Somebody write something !",0
"To be old school this book isn't really Paranormal it was more Urban Fantasy. Which isn't a bad thing. I find it hard to judge this book one way or another.  Scott Nicholson writes a great short story. You find that few and far between with writers, so on that point  the books a 5 star. I love short storys. My biggest problem and the one a can't let go of, is each story had to teach us a daily lifes lesson. I found that very irritating. Not the kind of storys I was looking for. The first story what a great idea, but it fell flat because of the daily lifes lesson. I also got sick of ""Mother Natures"" {thats my name for them} kids. I don't want to scare you off if you want a good read and those things don't bother you  read the book. As I said he's a great short sory writer.",0
It was ok. Not enough erotica but had some passion. I'm glad it was free. Would be upset if I paid for it.,0
I have a Kindle DX and the text to speech keeps stopping with a message that the text to speech is malfunctioning. Please fix.,0
This bundle is all three of the Bakery sisters series by Susan Mallery. You will love all three books. It's a good set of books that show the authors talent. Love everything I have read from her.,1
"Leotine and Cyprian's story is a great little novella.  She is sent to kill him and ends up falling for him.  Great new perspective, I just which they had their own full novel.",1
"Woman meets man, man meet woman, man does not know woman?  Ahh, she thought she knew everything, boy was she in for a surprise, but not has big as finding out the father of your child is dead, but his name is not.  This was so cute and the story was even better with each turn of the page.  I have to admit some areas were very predictable, but overall, everything comes together nicely to provide a good read with some nice heart warming moments sprinkled throughout.",1
"I enjoyed the story up to a certain point, but when plausibility took a nose dive so did my interest. It was too much of a hackneyed deus ex machina plot device when what amounts to an invulnerable ground-skimming flying attack vehicle with everything INCLUDING the kitchen sink was introduced.",0
"Started out hot then went downhill fast. She seems so feisty and willing to go after what she wants, then when she gets him all of a sudden she's pulling an about face and declaring he needs someone better. I hate Tstl heroines. Such a shame. Could have been a great story.",0
"I realise I'm in the minority here, but I really didn't enjoy this book. Admittedly, I was expecting a novel, I didn't realise it was a short story until I was finished with it.However, the sex scenes were rushed (I know the author meant for them to be passionate, but they came across like she just didn't put any time into reading them) and the characterisation was poor.There was no subtlety in the writing, everything was explained to the reader, as though the author couldn't figure out how to weave details and information into the story in a less in-your-face way.Having said that, I'm in the minority here, I do realise, and most people seemed to enjoy this book. It just didn't do anything for me personally.",0
"This book was lacking a number of quotes that I expected.  Since I am of an older generation, many of those quoted were unfamiliar to me.",0
Well written and a good story.  The book works on several levels.  One is the mystery and the second is a widow working through her feelings about relationships and her feelings about starting over and her faith.It was easy to connect with the characters though I would have given it a five it Lew has been a little better developed.  I thought the other characters were more three dimensional.I would certainly welcome a third book in this series though given the publication dates of the two books and the authors lack of other books under this pen name I think the two may be all that are forthcoming.,1
I'm going to keep this short and just say I really enjoyed this book.  I'm looking forward to the next one and will buy it the minute it comes out!  Keep the stories coming and keep all your new fans happy!  :),1
This was too short of a story for the real horror to have the shock effect that it deserved! Would make a great story if it had been longer.,0
I RATED THIS BOOK THE LOWEST LOWEST  BECAUSE  OF THE LANGUAGE  AND THE SEXUAL NATURE. I FEEL ONE CAN WRITE A GOOD STORY WITH OUT THOSE THINGS ION IT.,0
I liked this book. It was sad and sweet but sexy too. An enjoyable read. Well written book. Good characters.,1
Bella Andre shares an amazing trio of stories about three best friends' surrender to love during a weekend trip to the Napa Valley wine country. Each story was individual as each character. Yet the stories spoke to a need we each have for a love designed to satisfy our individual heart's desire. Carrie and Tyson. Rose and Jack. Vanessa and Sam. You should read this book for yourself and determine which comes closet to resembling your own story or the one you long for. Hmm good.,1
I liked it.  I liked the characters and the story.  The heroine was tough.  The hero was delectable.  I liked it all and want to read the rest of the series.,1
There was some kind of moral to this story there somewhere I guess. It is a pleasant one-day reading experience.,0
not well-written... no plot. characters cliched. and the whole fat/chubby thing could have been SO well written... and bad descriptives just made the issue icky instead of luscious and REAL. save your money...,0
This was an interesting turn to the classic vampire story.  I liked that the vampire was a good guy and that he proved to be better than the humans who had trained the hunter.  Good read.  Two thumbs up.,1
"Sorry, hate the book.  It was too flowery and gushy for me. It did not appeal to me in anyway. I could write a book on why I didn't like.  There were others who did so maybe it was just me, found it too sappy!",0
Shara Azod delivers another good book. I loved the characters but I wish there was more! It was to short to me because there were some things that needed better explination and I was left waiting and wanting.  The sex in this book was great but at times not believable (at least to me.)I recomend this book to anyone and everyone who loves to roead interracial books as much as I do.,1
"This is a pretty nasty book. Honestly, I think some orifices are not meant to be filled.I came back to read the description to see if I had inadvertently downloaded a book that is clearly porn. Not the case. The description does not foreshadow the nastiness within. Rather it suggests it's a run-of-the mill romance.",0
"The book is strangely light for being as dark as it is. I had a good time reading it, and liked the characters. I really wanted to get into Snapdragon Alley with them!",1
Cute book. Quick read. reads more like a kids book but I wouldn't say it is for kids with the language and off color jokes. No meat to the story.. but cute eough,0
"These stories were written in a rough tone and have an unpolished feel to them.

Mankind's Worst Fear is a book you should read. I had verry har time to put it down and I mean hard time. I lost sleep reading this. I read the book in 2 days. You will love this book.,1
Love the cover and the short story is just what I was looking for.  Sometimes you just want a little fun lunch time read.  This was it!,1
for me this didn't have much of a storyline. just scenes and scenes of them doing it and nOthing else.... disappointing.This is the first book of the series so the writing may have gotten better,0
I did not want to finish this. I prefer cleaner Christian books. This is too fleshy for Christian reading. Sorry.,0
"Chocolatier Mariah Hughes barely remembers the night of drunken revelry that led to her and her two best friends making wishes as they tied on wish bracelets during their vacation cruise a year ago, let alone what she'd wished for. Fortunately for her, the United Wish Federation keeps exceptional video records, and when her UWF agent shows up to grant her wish, a disbelieving Mariah is given proof even she can't deny.That still doesn't mean she remembers her wish.It's only with her friend's help that her memory is jogged. And when it is, it's hard to believe she'd ever wish for anything else. Six years ago she'd had a magical night with a young guy named I.C. Tucker. It was the best night of her life and Tucker had fueled her hottest fantasies ever since. She would love another chance with the now famous professional poker player.When her newest client turns out to be the soon-to-be-married bride of Tucker's best friend, and Mariah comes face to face with Tucker again after six long years, Mariah realizes two things. One, the man still draws her on every level, and two...her wish has been granted. And Mariah has no intention of letting the opportunity go to waste.Problem is, their connection is so intense and her emotions so quickly involved, that having their entire relationship based on nothing but some silly wish - something with a definitive expiration date - no longer appeals. Mariah wants a happily ever after with the man of her dreams...and hottest fantasies. To get that, though, she'll have to do the one thing that may push Tucker away from her forever.~*~So this is what you get when you take a little magic and a little chocolate, add a dash of humor and a bunch of hot sex, and stir with a surprising depth of emotional connection. Wow!All Inis an erotic PNR novella that thoroughly satisfies.Lately the most consistent issue I've had with the romances I've been reading is that too many are plenty heavy on the lust but not so big on the deeper interpersonal relationships and downright light on love, with entire relationships based solely on the horizontal...or vertical....or upside down, for the kinksters out there...mambo. And I'm not talking about the erotic romances, either. So to actually read an erotic romance that manages to blend the hot sex with a solid romance between two likable characters quite obviously made for each other was a special treat that I won't soon forget.There's plenty of hot sex, sure, but I adored how Willoughby had a plausible backstory for her characters that laid the groundwork for the romance that developed, so it didn't feel unrealistically fast when the relationship start getting emotionally significant for the characters. Mariah and Tucker were wonderfully into each other for more than just physical pleasure, and that romance is as sweet as the chocolate delicacies Mariah sells. It's a great balance.The paranormal elements were fun. Davina was a hoot and she stole every scene she was in. I didn't buy how quickly Mariah wrapped her mind around the whole wish granting thing, though, even with the proof she got (which was awesome in its own right), and I found Tucker's reactions later in the book to be even more of a stretch. Those were minor grievances, however, when compared to the strength of the rest of the story and my appreciation for an erotic romance that gave as much attention to the ""romance"" as it did the ""erotic."" I liked this one a lot.Disclosure: A copy of this novella was provided to me by the author for an honest review. This rating, review, and all included thoughts and comments are my own.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",1
"A very short story by two authors who wrote about two different persons with sadistic murder fantasies. Definitely not for those who have nervous disorders, heart ailments, gastric problems and those who are very sensitive, since this short story reveals how some people get wild pleasure and horrific thrill in killing a person slowly and painfully using some of the most deadly methods and instruments to kill.The basic underlying warning from the authors is about hitch-hiking (getting a free-drive  on the highways and expressways, from un-known persons).Two short stories, one with Donaldson (an elderly freelance courier man) and another Lucy (a young female guitarist). The first picks-up young boys and girls looking for a ride on the highway, ensures an isolated place and kills them most brutally after raping them. The murder is so horrendous that the victim is made to suffer the slow death by chopping off his/her vital organs one by one. Donaldson enjoys the screams and pain of the victim while doing so. Finally he burns the remains of the dead victim to keep the police clue-less. Similarly another young girl Lucy chooses cars on the highway for a lift/ride and uses a different strategy of injecting a slow poison in the drinks of her co-travelers. Later, she handcuffs the hands and ankles of her victims and ties them to their car with a rope. Then she enjoys the ride by brutally dragging them along the highway, first slowly and later at high speed, eroding them of their skin, flesh and bones one by one, until the point that only part of their skeletons are left.Absolutely no idea why the authors chose to write these stories, but I feel that they are one angle, inciting fresh sadistic and cruel ideas into the minds of the readers through such works. Any sensitive person might get heart stroke or nauseating effect while reading those parts of the book where the hunters enjoy the brutal murder process through their innocent victim&#8217;s extreme sufferings. Hope such people like Donaldson and Lucy do not exist in this world.Coming to the positive part of the short story, it is an indirect warning to road travelers on the following points from the authors.1: Don&#8217;t go hitchhiking, because the driver who picks you up could be certifiably crazy.2: Don&#8217;t pick up hitchhikers, because the traveler you pick up could be certifiably crazy.My rating is 2.5/5",0
"Paul's one act of youthful self-indulgence was to marry Jo, only to be persuaded to give her up for her own safety and allow her to think him dead, but when his sacrifice fails to keep her safe six years later, he forces his way back into her life determined to keep her this time. I wasn't always sure I liked Paul, but I didn't dislike him, so I found myself willing to give him a chance based on Jo's past regard for him. Jo, I loved! She had crawled out from her grief and became an amazingly strong female character, as a deputy marshal, able to hold her own amongst the military world that Paul drug her into. She was no damsel waiting for her knight to save her. I found the mystical attraction between Jo and Paul a bit over the top, but didn't think it detracted from the story too much. I enjoyed the interaction between Jo and her guards. The ending almost seems to invite a sequel and I wouldn't mind reading Nolan or Tait's story. All in all, good read!",1
My children weren't receptive to this book at all. In fact it didn't hold their interest and the plot wasn't interesting to them or me.I wouldn't recommend this book.,0
I bought this book after watching the movie League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I found the characters in the movie to be fascinating and wanted to learn more about their history.,1
It had potential but never got there. I'm glad I didn't pay for this. Just an essay so the author can promote her other books. Unfortunately due to the lack of being able to hold my interest in this essay I don't think I will be reading anything by this author anytime soon.,0
"It started off a bit slow, but managed to spark lots of interest.  It isn't her best work (I've read most of the Charlie Parker series),",1

Enough Good News was a o.k.read for me. I just couldn't get into the book. I kept putting it down I finally finished it I will not be reading book 2.I will attempt to other books by this author..,0
I got this book hoping that my kids would like it and when I opened it and they say it they were not impressed.,0
The book looks at both sides of a zombie outbreak while giving the zombie side intelligence rather than the usual mindless wanderings you see in other books.  The book was well written with few grammatical errors. The human side was well done and more realistic as the characters were not prepared and were not ex-military in any way.  This in itself led to somewhat believable situations (As believable in a situation where zombies are real).  For free read it you will like it.,1
"Several of these stories are fond favorites from the past, if your a H. Beam Piper fan this one is a must.",1
"This is a fun book, but how it got listed as a mystery is beyond me.  A little too much sex for my taste, but it's not graphic or explicit sex, and you can skip over most of it and not miss a thing.",0
"The story was well thought of. The author could have used a few good proof readers, but otherwise well worth the effort of reading it. The characters were enjoyable.",1
"I enjoy erotic BDSM stories; however, Releasing Kate goes way beyond what I normally read.  This book has hardcore moments that some people might take exception.  The story has an added paranormal twist that explains the brutality.  I enjoyed the story and I'm looking forward to book 2.",0
"This is Twain's satire of contemporary religious mores. It was the last fiction he published in his lifetime, and like much of his later work, it's slightly cynical and very sarcastic, although more upbeat than, for example, _Letters from the Earth_ -- mankind comes across as looking fairly silly overall, but on the whole positive.Probably of most interest to Twain fans who want to read everything of his that they can, or to scholars writing on Twain's religious views, more than to casual Twain readers. It's mildly amusing throughout, but no more than that, and Twain certainly wrote many other works that were more entertaining and more insightful.It's a fairly short read, at 630 kindle ""locations"".",1
"It was more a 3.5 stars but once I finished the book, I found that I was quite fond of the guys, in different ways, so I'll give it 4.I liked Ryan because, even if he knew he was risking his career, he was not willing to search for a compromise. I liked Josh because he was very practical and he found the way to get Ryan and himself out of trouble, showing that he might not be rich, but he was resourceful.The secondary characters were interesting and I liked Ryan's friend, Bill, who is the voice of reason in a very stressful situation. The bad guy behind the tabloid pictures was given a strong homophobic connotation and I thought it was unbelievable that Ryan accepted all the name calling without reacting.The angst was never too much, even in the most difficult moments, because the two characters trusted each other. I think that the chemistry between Josh and Ryan was more told than shown and that's why I wasn't really impressed while reading the book.",1

"I read about 25% now, and there's still no hint of any romantic interest from any main character. Other than that major disappointment, it's too mundane and slow most of the time, with too much redundancies and things that go without saying, as if written for slow-wits.",0
not what I expected from Maya Banks.  It was ok but pt was more about trust and having faith in your spouse no matter what happens.  hard lesson.,0
"Terrible, a child could tell  better creepy stories, just really bad story lines, almost amateurish in a way, camp fire spooky tales that are made up.",0
"This story was over before it started. The story starts off with this queen who has so many traitors in her midst and the guy is on top of that list. He quickly seduces her into a boring, too quick sex romp and then the story is over. This story took about 7 minutes, but the excerpts from countless of other stories they want you to buy took much longer, about what this book should have been.",0
"I did not expect much from this book. But at times, it seemed like I was reading the script for a really bad porn movie. Also the heroine was an idiot. She knew she was destined fo this life yet she still acted like a petulant child.",0

"I am upset i read this series out of order for book 1 is the best novella in this series! The sex scenes were hot!! I adored Robert and Celia was a great match for him! I think though that this novella could have been a full length novel for the plot was unique. Nevertheless it was a satisfying read, even if there wasnt much mystery this is one adventure I truly enjoyed!",1
"I ""bought"" this quickly and didn't realize it was a romance so I was taken aback at first by the language. This could have been interesting if it were longer. It felt like an abridged version of a longer story. Reading reviews now and finding it's a prequel novella to a trilogy makes sense but it wasn't enough to get me interested in the trilogy. It's like the author rushed this out b/c her editor told her to.",0
"I'm two for two.  Volume 1 was great.  Volume two is a bit different, but very good.  Told in a different way... You know who did it. The story is in how they're caught.",1
"Originally published as an e-book coinciding with the release of the novel Tatooine Ghost, Troy Denning's A Forest Apart is a short story following Chewbacca, his wife Mallatobuck, and his son Lumpy on a adventure into the bowels of Coruscant. Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue. It's always enjoyable seeing Chewbacca in action, and even though this story doesn't really add anything significant to the larger saga, it's an entertaining diversion.",0
The series is good and moves at a pleasant pace.  The description and life in Palm Springs is very clear,1
I didn't realize this was short stories.  I did not like it at all.  Had I known it was the type of book it was I would not have paid for it!,0
"I may have misunderstood the age group this book is directed at... I may have enjoyed these stories when I was 10, however probably not. They were very short, and had very little sustenance to them. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was definately let down. I didn't even venture into the extended preview at the end solely Bc I was that disappointed. Not worth the $0 I spent. My apologies if this offends the author.",0

"So after I finished reading Burn for Me, the first book in Ilona Andrews&#8217; new and AMAZING Hidden Legacy series, I got to talking with another Ilona fan, who had been told that the world-building in Burn for Me was similar to the worlds in the Kinsmen series and the novella, Of Swine and Roses.And I was like, &#8220;Huh. I can see that.&#8221; But it&#8217;d been years since my early OMG-I-LOVE-Ilona binge, so I decided a reread was in order.And here we are.Some time in the indeterminate future, when space colonization was the new Big Thing, humans began to genetically enhance themselves. They needed to be stronger, faster, heartier, more versatile. Some of these enhancements were tech-based, effecting only the individual, and some were biological, being inherited by offspring.&#34;It was quickly realized that the advantage of these biological enhancements lay in their exclusivity. Thus, the biologically enhanced united and shut down all further biological modification.&#34;And consolidated their power. They were called the Kinsmen, and to maintain both the potency and exclusivity of their enhanced blood, the families arranged marriages for their children based on bloodlines and business alliances.This is why Meli Galdes was betrothed to Celino Carvanna when she was 10 years old and he was 16.While neither of them was happy with the arrangement, Meli accepted it, but Celino did NOT. He worked the next 6 years to make himself indispensable to his family, and worth more as an individual than the alliance with the Galdes family.And he succeeded.But where did that leave Meli?An excellent question. And one you will only get the answer to by . . . wait for it . . . yes, that&#8217;s right&#8212;READING the book. *winsome face*Verdict: a quick, fun, and SEXY read. Yes, I know it&#8217;s Ilona Andrews, and yes, I know that fabulous as she is, she&#8217;s not particularly well known for sexy times, but there&#8217;s a first for everything, right? Highly recommended.",1
"Toni Blake is one of my favorite authors; great stories, well developed, likable characters, with some good sizzling sex scenes- they have always been a hit with me. This story is about Aunt Millie from ""Letters to a Secret Lover"" it was very short, 35 pages, a cute, sweet read. It reminded me of the Grease era, Johnny with his ducktail hairdo and leather jacket- very reminiscent of Danny, Millie- the sheltered, virginal Sandy. The story is about how they meet and fall in love. Since it is so short, there wasn't much detail and over development, but it still worked- a good love at first sight story that takes 30 minutes to read.",1

"It as just okay, short and to the point. i  would like to have seen it go a little futher.",0
I have enjoyed all the Henry Wright mysteries. The plots are good and they are well written. I would recommend it.,1
"This story tried way, too hard to be clever and shocking.  Also, the amount of profanity and vulgarity was not necessay.  Eventhough this book was free, it seemed like such a waste!",0
"To be honest, I only got it because it was free. I suspected from the cover that this book was going to be a pill, because the majority of X-mas books I have read usually are. And this cover is on so many books that aren't any good. But it was free, so I figured i would kill a few minutes reading it. My suspicions were confirmed from the very first page, when it described Elf as being a graying, and very crusty old woman. I just knew that it was going to be a boring story.And a very boring story it was. I had to finish it, so that I could honestly review it. To spite that I was having a hard time flipping to the next page.Not a book I would recommend, not even for the free price tag. Though it was well written, there were a lot of parts that dragged, and it really had nothing going for it to keep a persons interest.",0
"It was a bit predictable in some small ways.  A bit too much coincidence and unbelievable timing for the story, but well written and very readable.",0
"Sex Idol Shelley Munro.ARC provided via Netgalley.With all the reality shows that currently dominate TV ( and they're the reason I spend so much time reading and don't watch TV) I thought this sounded fun. I get the impression from many of the current programmes that what they really want is to push the sex angle as far as they can without getting banned or reprimanded, so this seemed like something possible at some time in the future. Though I think current TV is dire, this would really kill it for may of us who want programmes designed for those who think and use imagination and don't need to be spoon fed :)Still, the book. Well, as I said I thought this would be fun. A bit of sexy, spicy, erotica wrapped up in an interesting story. Sadly I was wrong, and what this consists of in my opinion is simply page after page after page of sex, self pleasure, with a partner or with multiple partners, with a flimsy, feeble story as an excuse for carrying it. The plot is thin, really poorly put together, (for instance landlords of commercial properties don't call round for a cheque days after a rent rise...it's all BACS transactions..) with the sex part being so repetitive its actually a turn off. I ended up skim reading pages just to see what happened, and get to the end. It certainly wasn't erotic for me :( Its sad really because I think its a novel idea, and could have been really fun and erotic if done in a different way.If you really like this sort of thing you'll find the price of 1.01 for 230 pages/369kb a bargain but for me...no - quickly deleted from my kindle.Stars: sorry but just one.",0
"Weekend Pick Me Up - Surviving The Fog by Stan MorrisSometimes you get a book or one is recommended to you and you read the synopsis and you cringe and you just don't want to tell the person that--&#34;No, this book just really is not for me. Thanks, anyway.&#34; You probably feel guilty or pained because it means a lot to the person and it really would make them happy for you to show an interest in the thing that they enjoy, but try as you might, you just can't imagine this book in your lifetime, or for that fact, the next one either. This book had no true blaring faults when I read the synopsis, but when I read it I worried I might be having that feeling because it would be a &#34;boy-centric&#34; Sci-fi. BUT I WAS WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! It was sort of &#34;boy-centric&#34;story but I totally got into this book and loved it hard.Stan Morris's Surviving The Fog begins with a group of youths between the ripe ages of twelve and eighteen spending a three week stay at a summer camp retreat in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California for an abstinence camp. They are there to learn about different birth control methods but ultimately to make a pact when faced with a sexual situation to take the high road and abstain. But shortly into their stay the Admin of the camp and the Counselors go lost and never return leaving roughly fifty youths with one counselor whose mental stability quickly devolves leaving them all alone. Knowing something very wrong has occurred thirteen year old Mike and his friend sixteen year old John attempt to make contact with the outside. When this fails they spearhead taking control of the camp before things get out of hand. It takes a while before a hierarchy is established but when it does, it is thirteen year old Mike who is the &#34;Chief&#34; of those left in the camp.When I started the book I had the odd feeling I was dealing with the set up of a 1980's slasher film. The young adults, isolated with the ominous feeling of impending suspenseful doom. Danger awaiting them and always a threat. After a couple of threats that feeling disappeared and something reminiscent of a happy telling of Lord of the Flies came to mind. Once it really got rolling I wanted more and more to keep going. I really didn't want to put it down.A whole lot happens in this book from point 'A' to 'B' and a good deal of detailed steps that add many dimensions to the large cast of young adult characters. Eventually, they come into contact with more people and their camp becomes the village of Petersburg--named for one of the founding members who helped establish peace at the camp at the start of the story. The happenings during the expansion will disturb many readers brought up in the black and white societal view delineating when a child becomes an adult. Also probably rural and urban upbringing will see the relationships that occur in this book differently as well. Many people will be offended or have argument with the later portion of the story.This story is a rather romantic view of communal living as a best possible outcome. Stan Morris's character's faith in human goodness and their ability to do what is best for one another in the face of a crisis is the vehicle that carries the story. For the most part the encounters with inhumanity that occur within the book are met with swift and severe punishment. It's the very definition of dura lex sed lex, the law is hard, but it is the law. However, in a times when humanity is tested, inhumanity will gather its forces. I really felt that there should have been a great deal more grief and strife. More uprising and usurping of power. The history of man does not really show a history of peace. Most of man's time on earth has been spent in bloodshed and a thirst for domination.The book had many issues which need a tune up. As good as the novel is it is just a little too long; it needed to be edited down just a bit so it wasn't so heavy to shoulder. I had no real beef with the simple writing style. Many might complain that Stan Morris's writing is too basic or undeveloped but for this book. The narrative being that of a thirteen year old boy, I truly thought he hit the nail on the head. The novel was too male centric and desperately needed to be balanced by more active respected female characters. I also felt that despite the pairing of couples that there never seemed to be any rhyme or reason for those relationships. I think he could have worked on developing a better psychological connection between them so it wasn't as dry and clinical as it came across.I wish I knew of books to compare this too but in my mind it really stands alone. I do recommend it and I'm suggesting it as a Weekend Pick Me Up but this one is one for a snowy or rainy weekend where you need to be taken away and forget this world for a little time. (This review was written for my blog All The Things Inbetween at Alicrean.com)Kathy's Synopsis:Kathy&#8217;s Recollections is about a group of teenagers attending a camp in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The camp was designed to preach abstinence and teach methods of birth control.  After a week, the cell phones are not connecting, and the mail has not been delivered, so the camp administrator and most of the counselors leave for a short visit to a nearby convenience store.  They never return.  After another week it become clear to one boy that something has gone seriously wrong in the world.  Then the campers discover that they are surrounded by a mysterious brown fog that appears to cover the earth below 6,700 feet.  The story is narrated by fourteen year old Kathy.  She focuses on their efforts to survive the elements, outsiders, and each other.",1

"The first half seems more suitable for teenage readers but I've started the second half and the story is becoming more interesting.  So far, the writing is descriptive in an interesting way and the love interest is developing but I have a feeling the ending is predictable.  The story is written in a wholesome way, not trashy.",0
"This review is of the updated and re-edited version, and is one-star only because 'no-star' isn't an option.This work is almost unreadable.  There may be a sentence structure or grammatical error that the author didn't make, but I think he managed to hit them all.  The author has no idea where to use a comma - he doesn't have them where they're supposed to be, and apparently inserts them completely at random elsewhere, as I could detect no pattern. He also throws in the occasional semicolon just to expand the range of punctuation marks he uses incorrectly.He uses almost no contractions, which makes the narrative and dialog even more  stilted, contrived and clunky.When he's not using cliches, his original descriptive phrases are astonishing in their badness: 'The homeless man slowly put one uneasy foot in front of the other...', a zombie's wrist broke 'with a thunderous crunching sound', and a building had 'outside entrances, almost like a massive cancerous duplex gone wrong.'Really?The characters are without exception cartoony and one-dimensional, the character development non existent, and the action sequences contrived and unrealistic.The zombies retain self-awareness and rational thought, possess magic zombie-vision, have many vampire-like traits, and can pass for normal humans.I was ready to quit at 25%, but I read through the whole thing to see if it would eventually get better - or at least less bad.  It never did, and in the end it just got 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' stupid.If the author wants to write a series, he'd be well advised to take several high school level English grammar and composition courses, a creative writing course, and get himself a copy of Strunk & White.  Otherwise, he may wish to consider taking up golf or bird watching.",0
"Here is another of Elizabeth's wonderful love stories.  The books take you into another world of love, lots of money and the good life that not everyone is privey to.  Enjoyed this book very much.",1
"I bought this because I liked the idea of the street kid and upstanding man going on with it. The first part of the book is pretty good, before anything sexual got involved in it. Then once masturbation and sex is introduced... its just not appealing. I think the authors favorite word is ""rammed"" when from the top of my head I can list a number of alternatives. Maybe it was to describe something rough, but instead it just gives the impression of painful and just... no. From some of the other reviews, Rhone had no prior inkling of being gay, which is true, but there were hints of an attraction to Adam that could have been expanded on. By the end Rhone was very much repeating, ""I don't know why by I'm so attracted to you"" (roughly). By then I was just done with the story. I liked Kasey and Rhone's brother when they interacted, but let me just mildly warn you there is one super-weird scene between Kasey and Adam. It started part way through and I was super put off by the abruptness and randomness of it. This book could have been written better.",0
"I LOVE shifter stories of any kind, but wolves are dear to my heart. The alpha dominance; gorgeous, primal beasts of men that long for their mate and then love her beyond comprehension once they find her--yep that totally does it for me. Add in a deaf heroine that's learned to stand on her own and not take any crap and I'm sold.My biggest complaint is the book moved a little fast. A bit more depth in the scenes and length in the plot would have given room for more conflict that wasn't resolved so quickly and without any loss or trauma. Some things were a bit over the top, but I enjoyed the story.",0

He is uninhibited in the bedroom -- a woman's dream!Elle Kennedy's descriptions of the interactions are scalding!  She has a gift. I love how she is introducing the full cast of characters slowly so the reader can keep track and continues to develop the characters.  Garrett, Shelby, Carson, Holly-- and introduction to Will.  I can't wait to read his story.  He is serious and somewhat gruff.This is another novella- quick read but completely worth it!",1

"This is the third book in Lila Dubois's Monster in Hollywood romance series.  I read the first book,Lights, Camera...Monsters: Monsters in Hollywood, Book 1but skipped the second bookMy Fair Monster: Monsters in Hollywood, Book 2.  I don't think I missed anything important to the plot of this book by skipping the second book, though I'm not sure if book three could be a stand alone, without book one setting up the monsters and everything.Runako, the male lead in this book was the villain in the first book.  He is angry at humans because they tortured and killed his twin sister, and so he doesn't want the Monster movie to be made.  However, after losing a battle with Luke, Runako is forced to change into human form.  There is instant attraction between Runako and Margo, the producer for the Monster movie.  This book starts with Runako abducting Margo off of the street, and taking her to a ""Captives Cave"" in the Rockies.  At the start, Margo is very much Runako's prisoner, and he chains her to a rock alter in the cave.  Runako has a great sense of smell in his monster form, so he can tell that Margo is attracted to him, and enjoys what he does to her, even if her words tell a different story.  Runako definitely has issues, he is still very upset about the death of his twin sister, and human nature.  Margo has some body and control issues.  Runako and Margo work to help each other overcome these issues.This book has more action than the first book in the series.  I enjoy reading thrillers, so I loved the action scenes.  The reader may have to let go a bit of reality to find the action scenes believable, but you're already reading a book about monster/human love, so it shouldn't be hard to just let a little more go.  This book also introduces additional monsters, as well as showing more about monster life, since location is primarily by Runako's home in the Rockies.  Like the other books in the series, this also includes a lot of monster/human sex.Overall, I'm happy with the decision to purchase the third book in the series.",1
"I was a bit skeptical about reading this book. The book description was iffy.  But it had such promising reviews. This book was boring to read. I struggled with it a good amount of the time. I had to finish it cause of O.C.D. I am just that way... I have to finish what I start, even if I don't like it.I spent a few days reading this. Due to it being so long and boring! The end was okay but it didn't make up for  the time I lost reading this book. I was disappointed. The title and picture made me want to read it. Good reviews as well as recommendations.I regretted it though. I learned that I should go ahead and read a few pages if possible, before I buy a book next time. You would have thought I learned my lesson by now, but no. I should have looked into things a little more. Go with my gut about how I feel about a book. I didn't. Don't make the same mistake I did, try and read a few page before.",0
"If you adore a good dragon shifter romance this is it. Edge of Craving an excellent romantic dragon shifter story. The dragon shifter is strong, alpha & so masculine. Alia is sweet, shy and strong. I get a feeling of softness when I read about Alia's character but also a strong feeling. The suspense, action & romance are well worth reading.Dragon shifter romance readers this is a great book to read.",1
"&#34;Lucky girl &#34;  not enough to hold a story together, just felt like a watered down version to fill in for the other stories that were already written the &#34;Crimzon & Clover&#34;  was the author around in the 60's seriously? besides the title the stories were really weak and I just did not like them and could not finish the book I tried but could only get three quarters  of the way through.",0
"A really good story, which surprised me. Usually, this subject matter isn't something I'd enjoy; two people usually do just fine.  But the reasoning behind the whys and wherefores were believable, all the way through.  Even the ending would work, I guess.",1
Dragon Knights is a world where Knights ride dragons and not slay them.  Wings of Change (I Dream of Dragons I) is a Novella that can be read before FireDrake or after.  It give some backgroung and insite into Helos and the Gryphons.  It does not advance the story line but does enhance it.  Another enjoyable read in the Dragon Knight relm.,1
This story has to be one of the worst I have read this year. The story is short and boring. The characters were not developed and the author was all of the place with the story. There where too many characters to follow and I'm still trying to figure out what was the point of the book.,0
"i started the bloodrunners series by reading book 4, unbeknownst to me.  i had no idea what the book was truly about but decided to read it anyway.  i fell in love with the story so much i had to research and find out what else might be with this book... then purchased and read the &#34;bundle&#34;...i absolutely love this &#34;bloodrunners&#34; series...and to keep it straight in my mind i reread #4 again and am now on #5!  this was all done in less than one week!  my breaks and lunches at work are spent reading!  i have already pre-ordered #6 and can't wait for it to come out!  this is a fabulous set of stories!i am so glad to have found this author and this series and look forward to seeing what is added to the series in the future!",1
"Yes, it is a very short story with graphic sex and is sweet without being too saccharine.  It does not have a lot of details or story line but for a quick free read it was worth the time.Chloe is a very shy introvert that is set up by her sister with Mark, wealthy(of course) but with scars.  They have sex, fall in love, separate because of misunderstandings and then, of course, HEA.Not much to it as others reviewers have mentioned but I did enjoy reading the book unlike some other short, free reads I have downloaded.  I really did not have high expectations especialy based on the length of the book but it did give me a sample of the writing style of the author and I may give one of her longer books a try.If your looking for something with a lot of plot and ""meat"" to it - pass on this book.  While this book is not what I would consider a keeper, it was enjoyable for a quick free fix.",0
"Lark Manning and Taran Lloyd were raised together after the death of her parents, Lark has always loved Taran but he thinks of her as a cousin. She wants him to see her as a woman but doesn't know how to get his attention, so she just gets on with her life. But when she is in a club where Taran is conducting an investigation, their lives collide in a big way and Taran has to watch Lark closly in order to save her life.I enjoyed this story but I didn't connect with the characters, I enjoyed the read but the resolution wasn't concise. This is a continuation of the story from Ready to Run but there was little mention of the gang of European shifters who were abducting women. I would think the case would be given more attention by now. I look forward to the next story having more involvement with the bad guys.",1
"This book was very well written and had an interesting plot in the first 1/3 of the book. THEN: the big ""secret"" is revealed about the hero- and it all goes down hill from there.  I've read many time-travel romance books, and this one had a lot going for it, until it went in a totally weird and skin-crawling icky direction.  I won't post a spoiler in my review- but lets just say that the hero misleads the girl and by the time the ""secret"" is revealed, you will be grossed out.  I was so disgusted, I couldn't read anymore.",0
"Plot/Storyline: 2 StarsThe novel started with a storline that was reminiscent of modern day Lord of the Flies, by William Golding. Unfortunately, that small similarity of teens building their own society is pretty much it for likeness.The premise is faulty from the beginning. A bunch of young kids are camping. I'm not certain of the youngest, but the oldest camper is seventeen. I know at least one is as young as thirteen. Then, when communication is cut off with the outside world, five of the six counselors leave the sixth and youngest counselor, a twenty-year old alone with all those teenagers. I cannot imagine any adults making such a decision.Then, out of all those kids and the one counselor, only one teen decides to try to find out what happened. I would have thought several would have wanted to hike down the mountain to find some adults, but the rest almost immediately start deciding what to do about winter, just assuming they will be there still.Any sense of suspense is ruined constantly by little remarks thrown in referring to things way into the future. The author seemed intent on making sure the reader knew that the kids would never be `rescued' from the very beginning. The kids certainly don't seem very concerned about being rescued with all of them willing to pretty much blindly follow one of the youngest boys in the group.The plot has very little to do with the fog or its origins. It simply focused completely on these kids creating a little society of their own. I will say that it was obvious that a lot of thought and planning went into the storyline. But, the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying.Character Development: 1 StarThe characters were flat and lifeless. The author was disinclined to give any back story on the main characters, so the reader must draw their own conclusions as to the kids' personalities and how they came to be.Writing Style: 2 StarsWhereas the subject matter may not be appropriate for young teens, the writing style was of that type of simplicity. Not only was the sentence structure coarse and unrefined, but the flow came in staccato bursts that was just exhausting to read. The time flow explanations were confusing, too.The descriptions were so sparse that I could not picture a character or a scene during the entire novel. The dialogue was decent in some places, but mostly stilted and uninteresting.Editing/Formatting: 4 1/2 StarsThere were a few editing errors throughout, but not enough to be a big issue. The formatting was of professional quality.Rating: PG-17 for Violence, Rape, and Adult Situations",0

"Wow, okay, I sense an Amazon.com equivalent of an egging or a TP party coming on, because if I am to honestly review Demonfire, it's not going to be NEARLY as flattering as the majority of other reviewers. Paranormal romance and urban fantasy are my two favorite book genres. I read and I review a lot of them. I've come to realize that I'm usually pretty forgiving of minor issues or singular issues - for example, if it's a decent story but not technically all that well told, I may give it a three stars, but explain in my review what the critical aspects are. I understand and accept that I hold my favorite genres to a higher standard - rightly or wrongly - than other genres and that ultimately I want to be entertained. I believe that if I'm not entertained given that the genre predisposes me to being entertained, then there's a big problem somewhere.I was NOT entertained by Demonfire.My apologies to Kate Douglas, who I've enjoyed as an erotic paranormal romance author, but frankly, I found the characters in Demonfire to be two-dimensional and the narrative to be repetitive, inexplicable, and at times heavy-handed. Eddy and Dax seemed cardboard and flat, and unfortunately, so did the entire impetus behind their relationship. The abrupt way they were thrown together felt too contrived and put a heavy strain on my suspension of disbelief (not even Dax could understand how he got into Eddy's shed from the portal he came through, so how could I?). When those issues combined with the perplexing mythology of the Lemurians to explain Altan's character and presence, the first quarter of the book felt like a cross between a snore and a quagmire of implausibility. To be honest, the pitbull/poodle mixed-breed canine was more fleshed out with a more believable and sympathetic backstory than two thirds of the book's main characters, and that's a problem.Dax is a former demon (now reincarnated/reanimated/newly de-demonized-sorta/former soldier boy) with a tattoo on his body that will come back to bite him...or try to again and again and again. Eddy is a human reporter who is willing to toss her job and fight demons she didn't even believe in yesterday. No convincing and little to no explanation needed. She finds out her touch soothes Dax's demonic curse...with no explanation and little to no coherent reason given. Altan is the ancient Lemurian who gave up his millennia-old and immortal life in the caverns of a currently inactive volcano (or other dimension...I wasn't too clear on that - could be both, I suppose, though I'm not sure why the volcano would exist in both dimensions). The parts of the story concerning that race and Altan's decision was anorexic in plot and very nebulous in the narrative, and I had a big problem with Altan's excellent grasp of modern American vernacular, technology, and cultural references, considering the written mythology. Toss in the dog Bumper, a will-o'-wisp tinkerbell-sort Willow (my favorite character through most of the book), and Ed, Eddy's father (by far the most interesting and believable character) and you have the core group that fights the big bad demons...who really aren't so big or bad, given that they're animating garden gnomes and other kitschy lawn statuary...except for the gargoyle - but you'll have to read THAT for yourself.The problems with the book aren't just in the characters. The world Douglas is trying to create here never really snapped into solid focus for me. Too many shifting descriptives and inexplicable happenstance. The book's main conflict, the threats of the big bad and smaller baddies was bizarrely non-threatening (you could've had a ""no humans were hurt during the writing of this book"" disclaimer). And then there was the repetition.Dax was given a human (sorta) body for one week to fight the demons slipping from Abyss. After the protagonists get together, the book counts down the rest of Dax's seven days and at some point in each one of those remaining days the fact he's only got six... five... four... three... two days left is given a lot of room in the story to explain in mind-numbing detail just how sucky it is for all concerned that Dax only has that much time left. And this melodrama went on each and every day, over and over and over again. Repetitively.I don't think that's compelling plot, nor do I feel that it engenders any sense of true tension, because as the reader I know going IN that it's a paranormal romance and Dax and Eddy are going to get their HEA. Otherwise it'd be called SHAKESPEARE. Lamenting for page after page about them being separated for eternity just becomes tedious and (dare I be repetitive?) repetitive. I've read excellent paranormal romance series that deal with this subject and it's always the ingenuity and originality of HOW the leads get their HEA that impresses me. I already KNOW they're going to. So by the end, when I was at least hoping for a glimmer of originality in the WAY Eddy and Dax stay together, I was ultimately disappointed again. I won't give spoilers...but it was just...not well done.So why the two stars, given how much it sounds like I hated it? Because I DIDN'T hate it. Maybe I was too ambivalent about it to hate it. Maybe that's worse. But mostly the two stars are because there were a few tiny glimmers of hope. Kate Douglas does write reasonably sensual sex scenes, and what little chemistry there was between Dax and Eddy shined brightest during them. I think it's hard sometimes to go from writing erotic novels to toning down the sex for a mass market audience, and I think that Demonfire was well represented in that regard. I think some people are going to think it was TOO graphic or explicit, but I'm not one of them. I also sort of ended up liking Altan. I still don't get why he talked in such a modern and culturally human fashion, but I thought he was sort of endearing with the sword that refused to speak to him and the crush he gets on Ginny. And THAT is why I will give Kate Douglas another chance. The second book in this series is due out later this year, and according to the sneak peak, Altan is off to Sedona where he sent Ginny to save her from what was going on...only to get a call that things in Sedona are even worse, as live animals are being possessed by demons and attacking their owners and neighbors and the like. And Ginny is stubbornly aware of Altan's machinations with mind control, despite Altan's best efforts. I think it sounds fun. And Ginny, for her few minutes of face time in the book, struck me as a more layered and spunky character than Eddy ever did. I'm looking forward to reading about them. We'll see.",0
"Lost and found love. WOW. I really enjoyed this book, even though it is short. I loved the idea that they both harbored feelings for each other in High School and now they can act on them. It was wonderful to see that they wanted to be a family and that it wasn't about just sex and living a unique lifestyle. I would read more of her work. The samples at the end have me intrigued to see if other works are as entertaining.",1
"I cannot believe the author had the audacity to charge for this piece of crap. All it is, is a fantasy of the erotic kind and a horrible way to end Prophecy's story. I will have to take a vow to read reviews before I purchase again. If this woman has any decency she would return the money I wasted on her crappy chapter. I hated it.",0
"Fans of the ""with"" series should recognise the overall wold in this short story.  While this could be read as an unofficial prequel to the series, as these characters are mentioned briefly (though not by name) in Without Reservations, if you are unfamiliar with these novels I would read it after the first full novel.  I enjoyed this one and didn't find Laine irritating like some others did; not everyone can be perfect and it was a nice change from some other shorts I've read.  If you enjoy the series you'll probably like this addition to it as well, I did.",1
"I really was looking for more of a tribute to the lost lives but this just seemed to be a searching for love in all the wrong places type book.The brutality toward the main character close to the end of the book, it just seemed exaggerated and taken out of an old movie or something.Too many lose ends and just matter of fact emotions.",0
Really sexy shifter tale! The underlying plot could have been more solid. Nice tale and I am interested in reading more. Hot Menage!!Really hot and steamy scenes. Nice romance as well!Cover Art - Beautiful,1
"While the male character was somewhat believable, the female character was NOT.  A thirty y/o woman who has had only 1 relationship, who has the insecurities described in the book, whose parents have died, and who spent time taking care of an ill parent may have the fantasies that Annabelle Lee has, but the way she would speak and act are completely different.  Her character would not be nearly as shallow and wanton as this female character.  Additionally, there was NO character development - these two characters ""fall madly in love"" after 2 weeks of having sex, and without any kind of acquaintance before their first introduction.  As IF!  Romance novels do have the ability to be well written with excellent plots that are bolstered by the development of the relationship between the characters.  THIS one is absolutely NOT one of them.",0
"I can't give it 5 stars because I felt there was no need to make a series.  There seems to no longer be stand alone books.  The author could have cut out half of the other chapters so that there could have been an ending.  There were typos but not to the point where it made it unbearable.I now want to know how this series end,  but can we start stopping at ONE book from now on?!",1
"I just couldn't get into this one very much. The protagonist was too far out. Wondering what she would have done if she'd had to get into a fist fight....but of course, guns were always the answer.",0

"Serial Killers and truck stops just seem to go together.  There's something about these latenite sleazy islands off the interstates that attracts the worst of our society.  Two of the nastiest serial killers ever dreamed up meet by off chance.  Jack Daniels, the famed police lieutenant, stops in at the truck stop for some coffee.  As you might have guessed, it's getting mighty crowded there and with that much adrenalin flowing, something's bound to happen and does.  A good solid thriller from the team of Konrath and Kilborn, who interview each other in a lengthy interview after the story.  Talk about split personalities. This book does not come with a warning label and it should.  If you are looking for Nancy Drew type fiction, maybe this ain't for you.  There's violence - a bit.  But it's great writing and you wont be able to put it down.  Five stars indeed.",1
"I'm a fan of Gena Showalter's. I've read a little of the books in this series, but my favorite is the Lords of the Underworld series.

I'm just really waiting for the next Lords book.",1

"J. L. Langley created a wonderful world of werewolves and mates and love and romance, and With Love is a fun tale indeed.Devlin is visiting another town, looking for a place for he and his business partner to move their construction company to. He's sizing up the local werewolf pack, introducing himself so he can scope out the feasibility of moving here. What he finds is a ruthless pack Alpha who is abusing his Omega, a werewolf named Laine, and terrorizing the rest of the pack. One thing about werewolves.... they recognize their mate instantly, that special person that Fate has chosen for him, and the omega Laine is Devlin's mate. He quickly claims Laine as his, and now must work to dispatch the Alpha and remove him from his post so the town can be in peace again and he and his Laine can live happily ever after.The erotic nature is wonderfully sexy, it's romantic, it's funny, it's witty, and it's all-around good fun. The pace is swift, though the danger presented within the pages seems to be dispelled too easily to make for any real suspense. Still, it's a totally fun and engrossing story.I heartily recommend it, and especially recommend ""Without Reservations"" and ""With Caution"" (in that order), two more stories set in the same universe (the characters in this book have been mentioned in Without Reservations). While I enjoy the other two books more, this is still a wonderful and entertaining tale.",1
I love a good romance but this is just to damn unreal ....sorry but I can't enjoy a unrealistic story like this.,0
"I would have given this book a 4.5 just for the editing problems but gave it a five instead of a four out of frustration at the negative reviews. I had this book sitting on my kindle for a week or so not bothering to read it because some of the reviews made it sound only mediocre. I sat down and read this through in one sitting. It was great. It did have quite a few typos, and misprints but for crying out loud its a self published book THATS FREE!I would love it if the author was able to make the book $3.00 and get some money for his work so that he could write a second. For a debut novel which I believe this is, it was a stellar performance. The character development was great. I could have used a little more antagonist descriptions ( its good to also get to know the bad guys we don't like), but the good guys were very knowable lovable. Sure parts were a little far fetched but its fantasy fiction?This book is chock full of heroism, good characters making common sense decisions honorably and humor.I would really like to see the story develop more, and a great way to do it would be to write it from the perspective of other survivors and give more ""alien"" information. HINT HINT.I would buy a book two for anything under $5.00 (my usual kindle cap) without hesitation.The language and sexuality and violence would all be rated about a soft PG-13. The sexuality in the book is just verbal discussions about sex not actual descriptions. I will recommend this to my older teen not my younger one yet.",1
I loved the characters and story line.  The romance and love that happens in each of the stories is great.,1
"Below you will see my review for the old Kindle app which I rated one star.  I am now upping it to three stars.  I canceled the paper with the old app because it was too incomplete.  This version has more of what is in the paper.  Sadly you can no longer buy a single addition proving yet again that the Times does not have much respect for the consumer, but I will subscribe to this when I am away from the paper version and cancel when I am in an area with access to the real paper.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I have had the Kindle version of the paper for a year or so and have enjoyed having it on the road.  However, it is an extremely abridged version of the paper.  So if you need some information like theater schedules, you need to use the online version.  The Kindle version is particularly bad since it has very little of the actual paper information.  It also is far inferior to the online version.  I finally had to give it up since it really is inadequate and woefully overpriced at nearly double other papers.  I suggest getting the free BBC app and USA today free version (not that I particularly like USA today).  But the combination of these two free services is far superior to the NYT Kindle version.  Or subscribe to just the NYT online version which has a full news experience though it is very cluttered compared to some of the cleaner more modern news apps.",0
I gave this book 4stars because the ending actualy suprised me and that does not hapen often. This is a great book if you want a emotional read. Have a box of tissue ready because the ending will make you cry because even though you no its coming you dont realy no the impact its going to have on the story or you. So b warned if you dont want to cry dont read this book.,1
It was a great read and could not put the book down.. Very good Arthur great story line.  must read,1

"3.5 stars.I wanted to like this book more, but I'm a bit disappointed by the way it ends.What I liked:* Will, the human protagonist. I really cared and ached for him. The story of his abuse by his partners made me hurt so much, especially because Will is a caring, witty and lovely man. He also seems pretty honest to himself. There is a point in the middle of the book where he compares being hurt physically and being hurt emotionally and I really had to stop reading for a while, the emotion was so deep it seemed impossible for me to recover.I liked the slices we get of his job as a radio host. I would have liked to see something more, the phone callings he got were interesting.What I didn't like:* Will and Cobalt had each their set of problems. While Cobalt's resolution was completely satisfying, Will's resolution was perplexing to say the least, both regarding what leads to it and what the real consequences are. It sounded improbable.* In comparison to Will, Cobalt's character is more superficial, one-dimensional. On the other hand I felt that one of the secondary characters, Uriskel, with his bad reputation and dangerous mission, was far more interesting and I think I would appreciate him even more when I'll re-read the book. It's one of those characters that strips themselves page after page until you get to the core.I wish the half star would show!",0

A nice romance with a little mystery thrown in. I loved the characters and story line. I would hope that there would be a followup.,0
this was my first book from this author and I quite enjoyed it.  The sexual tension between the 2 characters and his friend was hot.  The sex was hot.  You just fall in love with the characters from the start.  It was a short story but it was a great one.,1
I love this book it was a very enjoyable read. I couldn't stop reading to find out what happened in the end. Stacy attitude became kinda at times throughout the book. It's NASCAR you have to love NASCAR.,1
"I found the writer was very good at portraying people and places. There are lots of twists and turns before the story is revealed. I would have given it 3,5 stars. There is nothing inherently wrong with the book. I just found it too drawn out and a bit repetitive. She kept going over the same ground and same people. The end was a bit abrupt and I did find her constant denials about magic becoming irritating. But it was an interesting book and I am sure many people will enjoy it.",0
"I've changed my mind. Mirandia is officially the most oblivious character I've ever seen. I knew from the very first sentence what the ""twist"" in this book was. Though I suppose one can hardly call it a twist, when everybody but the main character knows what happened. Now I'm not sure if it was ever meant to be a twist...Despite wanting to scream in frustration every time she lamented her husband's disappearance, I really enjoyed this book. The book was very well written. There are no big action scenes. There are no epic battles. It's just the story of a woman trying to find out what happened to her husband. Yet I could not set the book down.I loved the world the book is set in. It could easily have taken place in the real world, a few centuries ago. The way the world is set up made me think very much of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell...just not on as grand of a scale.The characters were written well. I never had to stop to figure out why a certain character acted a certain way - everybody was developed enough, and had clear enough personalities, despite not being mentioned for more than a paragraph or two. Even the side characters had clear motivations. It was nice to read a book where everything was put in place for a reason, and all plots get tied up.The only problem I had with this book was the whole Miranda not figuring out what happened bit. For as smart as she was, she really should have caught on sooner...or if not caught on, she should have at least started questioning things. Every time something new got pointed out, I just wanted to scream when she didn't think twice about her observations. But, aside from that, this was a very enjoyable read.[Though I do question that...semi-bestiality? Near the end. After reading descriptions of the change...why? Just...just why?](Follow my book reviews at: [...])",1
"Dominant Species spends a few pages introducing us to a Marine major and his crack team of specialists and then drops them on a rebellious mining world to break open a fuel depot for an incoming invasion force. Which goes really well until they fall down a mine shaft into a deep cavern occupied by a mysterious, ancient ship. The book follows their race for survival against odds that only continue to mount against them....In short, you pick up this book and once you get past the first couple of chapters' worth of set-up, you don't put it down until the characters are safe at the other side. This is great military SF: non-stop action, great tech (there was some serious thought put into their power armor) and an unexpected plot to boot. The author has a pretty impressive background, too; seriously, his other available book is The Emergency Responder's Guide to Terrorism. That's not fiction, mind.I read some of the reviews left about this book and was puzzled by them. Some people complained there wasn't enough character development, and I wondered: good Lord, in what time? People who are trying desperately not to die don't exactly have time for deep conversations about their feelings. This book is solid action from beginning to end: you read it for the same reason you get on a roller coaster, for the adrenaline high. Dominant Species definitely delivers.I did have a couple of quibbles: the author confuses ""it's"" and ""its,"" which is tiresome if you're sensitive to grammar; years of reading forum posts have inoculated me against outrage so it didn't bother me. There were also some wordos (the author liked to use the word ""prosaic"" when he really meant ""poetic"" for instance). And the title is a little misleading given the plot. Otherwise, I found it quite enjoyable.If you're looking for a novel that reads like a summer blockbuster action flick, complete with awesome gadgets and cool extrapolations of future tech, you have got to pick this one up. You can sample it and see if you like it. The whole book's only $1.99. Cup of coffee or several hundred pages of explosions... doesn't seem like a hard choice to me. :)",0
"Wow! Part of this would be a dream come true for me! Super-hot muscular construction workers getting all sweaty while working next door. All of them want to drive Kate through ultimate pleasures. What I was surprised at was the amount of m/m action. There wasn&#8217;t much character development so it was a little hard to keep up with who had whose where, but the action is still steamy. I will definitely be looking into this author some more.My favorite quote, that I will be adding to my favorites list:&#8220; Everyone lusts. Everyone Fantasizes. When your lover respects you, you should feel free to explore your desires. No matter how extreme.&#8221;",1
An awesome story from start to finish! The books just keep getting better and better. I am a collector of the series and am never disappointed and once again totally enamored with the characters. Keep 'em coming!,1
"What a disappointment. I thought it would be a nice Christmas romance, but it turned out to be disjointed, with underdeveloped characters, and an unrealistic storyline. The chemistry between the two characters wasn't even believable, but even that was ruined by the crude description of what develops between the two of them. It was like two teenagers in heat. I found myself wondering what happens in the end, there was no closure to the psycho ex- boyfriend. The content was lousy. Thank goodness this book was free. It was an hour read at best, with no real beginning, middle, or end. Major diservice to the visibly challeneged in that he's seen as weak and needy.",0
"Diana Bold has written the story of Dylan, the younger son of a lord and Lady Natalia, the only child of a wealthy duke. It all starts as a wager he must win -- to get two dances from the haughty heroine. Part 2 is the story of his brother, Michael and a wealthy American heiress. The character that I want to know more about is Clarice.",0
"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence, no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But, while some of the formatting flaws add to the story, there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything.",0
"I never got past the first or second chapter.  I'm not in to real gory stuff.  But if you are, this is the book for you.",0
"NO SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 of a trilogy, Vampire-themed Urban Fantasy/Romance. Overall pretty entertaining- story pulled me in, I liked the characters. Vampire mythology standard, but intricately described- politics between ""Houses"" is important. Note this is pure vampire, so you don't have any human perspective- they are predators, pure and simple. While romance was a constant theme, it was not the central plot and there is no sex. Violence is fast and bloody, but not overly gruesome. BE WARNED: Cliffhanger ending. You have to read book two for the rest of the story! (I haven't yet, but hear it's an even better book.)PLOT: Fast paced, excellently set up. I was really into the story until the last 25%. Things started out very well done, but fell apart at the end. The characters were thrown together and ran all over Europe in a romantic adventure, but eventually you had to ask ... when were they going to get some SOLID INTEL? Going into the last battle, we STILL didn't know who we were fighting or why. It was unsettling and bizarre and it led to the cliffhanger ending. It was ALMOST a great book, but reading to a cliffhanger when even you as the reader knew there was a problem is just f-ing frustrating. (See? It even made me swear!) This story arc could have used a little extra thought.CHARACTERS: Although slightly wooden, I really liked both Valentine and Prophecy. I attributed their slightly wooden natures to the fact that they were highly vampiric and not human at all. Despite that, they were very sympathetic. It was heart wrenching and thrilling to watch them grow close and ride out their emotional turmoil. Very well done on that front. Romance is teasingly light with barely a kiss, making the next book all that much more important!BOTTOM LINE: DESPITE my annoyance with the holes in the plot, I really did enjoy most of this book. I fully intend to continue to read this series and I notice Heaton has written other books set in the same ""realm,"" so I'll eat those up too!RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Katie Salidas'Immortalis Carpe Noctem- girl is turned after an attack and then tries to adapt and cope with a little bit of guidance from a sexy vampiric savior2. Jocelyn Drake's vampire/were/demon centric series full of grit:Nightwalker (Dark Days, Book 1)3. H.P. Mallory'sFire Burn and Cauldron Bubble: The Jolie Wilkins Series, Book 1- poor young woman accidentally discovers creatively drawn world of fae, vampires, weres and more. Weaker female character, but still well written4. Jeaniene Frost's vamp mystery packed with actionHalfway to the Grave (Night Huntress, Book 1)- sexier, more erotic, but also lighter & funnier",0
Well written excellent plotline. Likeable hero and heroine and a great supporting cast of characters! Can't c.f. wait to read the rest of the series!,1
"Joe loves his life as he has a great job building bridges around the world, lives in a wonderful house in Saltburn by the sea, and has no dangling relationships.  However, being away a lot, Joe needs a house sitter to walk Wolf, but she must respect his quiet.  He advertises in the Cleveland Gazette.  London manicurist Tess applies for the position.  She arrives for the interview with her eighteen month old daughter Em.  Although he wants no noisy children and does not like the fact she never mentioned Em, Joe gives her the job temporarily mostly because she likes the garden.Joe and Tess forge a tentative relationship, but he finds it odd that she fears beaches.  As they begin to open up to one another, Joe learns Em's dad is Dick an irresponsible singer while Tess finds out why he relishes bridge building.  As their threat of leaving abates, an attraction grows between them, but though he reaches out into the darkness with a need to be a Friend and Lover to her and a father to Em, her fears cripple her from crossing the bridge.Although the reason for Tess' trauma seems a bit weak, fans will appreciate this contemporary romance starring a reclusive male and a neurotic female.  The support cast to include Em and Tess' BFF Tamison and sister Claire are bridges to the story line as they anchor past and present.  Readers will enjoy this engaging tale of a traumatized single mom finding love but contentment is much harder to achieve.Harriet Klausner",1
"I really like this short story, but it was too short. It would have been nice if it was longer and I would have enjoyed it much more. The characters are were defined, but I would have loved to see how it all actually played out. Kind of hoping that maybe the author will write an extended version.It does make a good short story though.",0
"I am really not a fan of this series..which surprises me 'cause I love Lora Leigh.  She did not write this book..or most of the Bound Heart books for the masses.  I dare say, only a select few will enjoy these books.",0
Was listed in the Graphic Novel section yet it's not a graphic novel. It's a flat out book. Pass on it.,0
"Argus is in a dead-end job, with a crappy living situation and an uneventful life. He is largely absent from the world, choosing not to interact with his many roommates, and having little experience with quality human interaction. That is, this is Argus' life until now. A mysterious encounter with a stranger leaves Argus with a strange box filled with seemingly unrelated artifacts. He doesn't know what it all means, and, with an absent family and no real friends, he doesn't have anyone to ask. When one of his roommates reaches out to him in kindness one night and notices the odd collection, the roommates set out on an adventure to discover the meaning behind the mystery.Tom Lichtenberg has written a short novel that is both appealing and spellbinding as you discover clues right along with Argus. The desire to figure out the meaning behind the box of items keeps you reading until the end. That ending, however, felt somewhat abrupt and rushed, and was a bit of a disappointment after the path of discoveries. It is hinted that this experience has left Argus changed, and I would have liked a little more information about that change and what impact it might have. I wanted to know more about what happened to the other characters at the end as well. I wanted a little more, and I would be interested in further stories in this same vein.The writing style is unique, but well-suited to this type of unconventional story. The character of Argus is fairly well-developed. He is a very insular man who has very few authentic interactions with others, preferring to spend endless hours alone with his own thoughts. There is just enough information given to make you wonder more about Argus' family, as well as his experiences with others growing up. Some of this backstory may well be included in ""Snapdragon Alley,"" a prequel of sorts to this book, where Argus' older brother holds center stage. I also want to know much more about the character of Fulsom. How did he end up needing to be ""in charge"" of the situation presented at the end?MotherLode blog",0
"I enjoyed this story because the H was so alpha and he had absolutely no idea that he was in love with the h. It was quite sweet actually and although he did some stupid stuff, the reader felt sure that his actions were motivated by love. I also enjoyed the secondary characters. This book is recommended!",1
ENJOYABLE read. Love happy endings. Must read more books from Ruth Ann Norton. If you like historical romance books I think you would enjoy this book.PB,1

Simon wastes no time once he knows Becky was his.  I do wish Ms. Bell would have explored how Becky knew about the ringing because I would have been interested to see more and have an explanation as to why it was happening.  It was a cute way to break the tension and caused for me to laugh, so it works out in the end.I am Joyfully Recommending Sweet Dreams because it made me laugh and kept me on my toes.  I can't wait for book three.Jambreareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
"This book was more of a thriller-drama. I felt it lacked in the romance department. The first 3/4 th of the book was all action with adventure, and getting to know the characters. It seemed drawn out more than it needed to be. It is the last part of the book that was the best finally having romance and just when you think the story is is living up to expectations you're left hanging which I guess is to be expected since it's a trilogy. So, yes I recommend this based on that understanding.",0
"I exected something a little bitter. The first part was kind of enjoyable, but th second have was awful. The hero, Simon, flirted with the older woman, Cynthia, to keep her in a good mood. But, liked are heroine. If its a romance novel, than the hero should only pay attention to the heroine and not some bags of bones. The writer should just give up writting and never write another book, ever.",0
"This book is not one of my faviourties, but that may be because I was not expecting the unexpected, I did read the whole book and enjoyed the story line and some of the quirky lines, and the story flowed.sorry it is me not you.",0

Great characters & sweet story.Keep in mind that this is an erotic fluff romance.  4.5* of 5*",1
"Although I skimmed through some difficult toread overly discriptive and obtuse passages, overall the story was a fun read.  As others have pointed out the dialogue could have been a little less wooden and stereotypical.  However I really want to see what happens next and I am certainly ready to buy the next book in a series...",1
"This book should come packaged with a thud pillow and something to bite on. If you love mm romance, and especially if you love a little bdsm, you will LOVE this story. If you're like me and you tend to avoid cowboy stories because they seem to cliche, fear not, the story is fantastic, and the love scenes are so hot. The bondage stuff isn't heavy but there is enough to enjoy sinking your teeth into. ;)",1
"This series of books is so much fun!  I love the characters, and the author's imagination in coming up with this storyline is phenomenal!  Highly recommend!",1
it was a book that i could not put down. but it ended with them running off into the woods and i liked that. the only thing i did not like is that there was pause or anything between story end and excerts from the next books.,1
I recieved this book for free and tried reading it but just could not get into the storyline. The author is great though.,0
It was a fast read but it seemed as though it went by too fast. Not enough meat in the story...like it was written in a hurry. But that's just my opinion.,0
I'm sure plenty of ppl might hate my review....too bad..but I am SOO SICK of this type of menages like this....I want one where both men love the woman and ONLY WANT HER!!!I DO NOT find it sexy or romantic that they are having sex with her one minute andwith each other the next!!! if that what you like ..I can't say i get it but  ok..whats romantic aboutsharing your Man with another man? but at least warn me soo I can avoid it and waste my money on it..off to hit hit DELETE!!!!! NOT SEXY OR ROMANTIC!!! was starting to love it until i saw the men wanted each other too :(,0
This book was entirely too boring.  The characters were not developed well and there was no chemistry between them.  The sex scenes were a complete snooze.  I am glad that this was a free book.,0
"I've never said this of a book before.  The author appears ignorant of basic English writing skills. For example, a conversation back and forth between two people is jammed together in a single paragraph, making it hard to read. The writing is so incredibly terrible that I found it impossible to actually read the book.",0
"1.5 stars (rounded up to 2 stars, because the book had a plot - too bad it was buried under all the non-stop, mind-numbing sex)Nuff said.",0
This story was just too weirded out for me and she was just hungry for sex all the time. Just not my type of story.,0
"A different type of western, well written.  Have read four of these books and each one is a very interesting read.  Hard to stop once you start the book.  Who would think a world renowned pianest playing honky tonk music in a saloon would be quick on the draw?  Yes, a little different, interesting western.  I liked all four that I read.  I'd give all four of'em five stars.",1

"I've been reading Dane's books for a couple of years now and just when I think I've read everything she's written I stumble on rare little gems like this story. I loved Caitlin and Eamon's love journey and who can resist a hot Irishman! I would've loved a little revenge scene with her ex but that's just my petty bitchiness coming out. I did wonder a bit about Caitlin's sad friend Amy and her love troubles and it even seemed like it might've been a spin-off to another story. If anyone knows if it resulted in another Lauren Dane masterpiece, please let this fan know!",1
"It felt rushed as if there was no time for them to actually get to know each other. Plus, only a few sex scenes which failed to impress. A bore.",0
"There's quite a bit of unnecessary info, and although I try to avoid doing so, had to skip quite a few pages throughout. They were really, REALLY boring. The rest of the book, however, was really pretty good. I'm not usually into religious stuff, and I only read this because I thought it was about the antichrist, but I still enjoyed it.",1
When I checked how long the book I was surprised. I got it for only 1.99 and it has over 1000 printed pages. I downloaded it on my Android and have read most of the first story. I never cared much for Max Brand but as I read I think it will be better than I remembered.,1
"This was a decent read for the money. I felt like the story ended mid-swing so to speak however. I would have liked a more solid end instead of just the abrupt end it has. Still, it's worth the read...",1
Wow what great read. Characters were well written and came you guessing on the plot. Loved the ending & look forward to reading her other series.,1
"This story was good enough to keep me involved until the end, however it could have been a great story with better writing.  The author needs to remove every ""had"" in the book and then go back and edit it.  It seems that most of it is written in the past tense, sometimes switching to present tense, then back to past tense.  I am glad this was a free read.",0
"This book dashes in circles, always relying on the same, redundant information to keep readers reading. I was so bored at the end, I sped read and didn't actually care about whodunit. I didn't feel like the characters were developed nearly enough.",0
"A long time ago...wait it was only exactly 2 years ago, I bought a book about frosting. Reading it, I fell in love with the author's style, but wanted to read longer stories. Speed up a 2 years later and I have read every book she has written that I can find. Lissa Matthew's came out with a book called Masked and mentioned on her blog that one of the main characters, Thor, was in this book. So after I finished Masked, I pulled this book out of the archives to read it once again.Aidn is a much sought after Dominant in a local club called Abyss. After a traumatic split with a submissive years ago, he only takes on trainees and one-night submissives. But he has come to realize he is bored with the same things and vanilla just isn't for him any more. Unfortunately, he has a hard time reconciling this with himself.Bailey is coming into her own. After not being able to work out her marriage, she has divorced and started her own bakery business. She knows Aidn from causal meetings at the Abyss, but never thought of him seriously knowing his reputation. When he approaches her outside of the lotion shop she can't believe he wants to have sex with her. She is comfortable with herself, but she knows not everyone is into larger women.They have a steamy afternoon in her place above the bakery. From the counter-top to the bed, they both believe this is just a one time affair, but Aidn gets the feeling she is the submissive for him and runs in fear. This is the theme for the story. She is ready to accept her submissive side and knows Aidn is the one, but Aidn can't let go of the past and continues to leave her several times during the course of this novella.While I understood why he had a hard time with what happened with his ex, it is no different from someone who gets a divorce. Eventually you have to get back up and if it falls in  your lap, you deal with it. He always seemed to be running and using Bailey and he knew it. I liked his character though. He struggled and eventually realized he needed to let go of the past. Bailey...I adore this woman and I want her frosting recipe. I can just imagine sitting down and eating a whole bowl of it. It's a dream of mine to own a bakery like hers...but it is only a dream for me since I can't make anything but a standard store-bought cake. That's just another reason I love this book. It speaks to my dreams.The characters are hot! The supporting characters flint in and out of the book quickly. It's a fun quick read!",1
"Day of Sacrifice: The Prophecy (Day of Sacrifice Stories #1) by S. W. Benefiel(Discloser: I received this eBook free in order to write a review)Summary:Flora is approaching her twenty first birthday.  That is normally an exciting time for a young woman, but Flora isn't normal.  She is the first born in her family and, therefore, is the family sacrifice to the Gods.  Her entire life has lead up to the day of her death.  Her sacrifice ensures the Gods blessings on her family.  Flora is a bit of a rebelled but she knows her duty.  She pushes the limits to the fullest extent but she knows what will happen on her birthday.  Her pure body (she's a virgin) will be sacrificed to the Gods.My thoughts: (Some spoilers)For a short story, this novella was packed with a lot of story.  An entire background was given for a society that contains supernatural beings (witches, werewolves, and vampires) as well as lowly humans.  Included with the background for the story, a short tale was included.  While I think that the background information was well done, I'm not sure that the characters were as well developed.  The story happened very fast and I was unclear why chances were taken.  Some of it seemed very convenient to the story.  The idea of sacrifices was clearly disliked by many characters in the story but it seems that it has gone on for quite a few years.  Such ingrained tradition doesn't get challenged on a whim.  There just wasn't enough story invested to make any kind of changes.  Clearly, I am implying that there is a challenge to the idea but I won't say any more about it.Personally, the book was too graphic with too many uses of the F word but if those things don't bother you, then you may like this book.  With all that said, I give this novella a 2 out of 5.",0
"This was a different ""end of the world"" synopsis. No zombies, pandemic, or virus. You can guess- it is a fog. The  children grow up as young adults in this book, which I found wonderful! A refreshing read. You will see the endurance of the human spirit and can easily see what could happen in these circumstances. Not the ""fog"", but if any children were left to their own devises for a long period of time.Several people have made negative statements about a kid of 16 pairing with another, about age 27 years old. That would not be uncommon in this type of setting. The amount of people in this story are limited. Also, sexual desires often takes precedence over what would be considered normal. I never make comments of editing. I know any author is doing the best he can afford at the time.",1
"Entertaining but predictable book.  It's a good one to read on a cold night with a cup of hot chocolate, I'm thinking.  The story takes off immediately, no waiting for the exciting parts, but some of the character development creates a very predictable story line. It was just the right amount of scary to put the paranoia in the reader when the night falls.",1
"For some reason I have the impression that Geena has changed editors. I have read many of her books, but this one is not remotely like the ones I used to like. The way she writes is sloppy with unusual indifferent lines. The story is short and is hardly a story at all. I must agree with another reviewer who 'finds herself frustrated with the lack of an imaginative story line behind all the adult scenes and foreplay.'I must give it 'only' a two star because the 5star reviews are deceptive for someone searching for a good book. I know Geena can do a lot better than this.",0
"This is a short story focused on Darth Maul's role in helping the Trade Federation gain a mining colony. It's not bad, but it's also nothing exceptional. It's fairly short so we don't really get to see any characters develop. The few events that do happen seem to go by quickly, including what should have been major battles. The story is included in the novelShadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul), which is worth reading, so don't bother to buy this one separately.",1
A little over the top. The characters seem shallow. I didn't think it was that great. It just stopped abruptly at the end.,0
I bought this book for the cultural experience of learning what other cultures grow up hearing. I have enjoyed my experience reading this book and would certantly recommend it.,1
"The cover, title and blurb led me to believe this was going to be a true romance with an HEA. Unfortunately, there was very, very little romance and nothing in the way of what I would consider an HEA. This book left a depressing, bitter taste in my mouth. It would be nearly impossible to give a summary without spoiling it, so I wont do that here. I wouldnt recommend this book, but since its a freebie, it may give you a taste for the author's writing style.",0
"In fact not worth reading. Longwinded, autistic, not credible, not the Irish humour I expected. Excellent to fall asleep over.",0
Great book. I now understand more about the Indian perspective and why they attacked the wagon trains and collected coup. Their sense of family was so caring and their protection of their hunting grounds was so important to their way of life. Highly recommended read.,1
"Seven Days From Sundayby M. H. Sargent (Kindle version as of 6/10/10) has enough rough edges that I stopped reading at 10%. There are some annoying typos in the Kindle version. Also, there are a few grammatical errors. The writing style is fairly basic, probably at a high school or early college level. Furthermore, the content seems to be limited in odd ways. To the point I've read, the characters and plot seem rather flat.Here are a couple of quotes to illustrate the peculiar style and content.""He had been on these CIA jets a few times over the years and it never failed to amaze him how fast the luxurious airplane could fly.""""McKay had noticed that the flat machine was connected to an IBM notepad computer by a thin cable.""If these two sentences satisfy you, perhaps you will like the book. I find these and many others to be weak in both style and content. If you consider the subject matter (including some violence) suitable for late teens, or you enjoy reading books with a simple style, I would add an extra star to the rating.",0
I didn't enjoy the writing.  The story was decent but not compelling enough to recommend. I almost stopped reading altogether when the story finally ended.My advice: pass.,0
"I did not read the first three books but it didn't seem to matter. This book was exciting, suspenseful and addicting. The characters are rich and well planned out. The plot is exciting and had me glued to the book until I finished it. I plan on reading the first three books and any other books by Frank Tuttle. Bravo!",1
"The book had 1764 locations on my kindle. The book was about a 26 year old woman, named Alicia and a 30 something year old man, named Adam. Alicia was very responsible and had been financially taking care of her mother and sister for several years.She was strong in some ways, but emotionally weak. Adam was very wealthy, handsome, jealous, ruthless and determined man. He also had trust issues, due to his past. He took, whatever, whomever he wanted and he wanted Alicia. She was accused of stealing money from his company and he blackmailed her into becoming his mistress.  The book contained very tame sex scenes, in my opinion, but overall this was a 4 four me. BUYER BEWARE, if you do not like a take charge, overbearing male. who makes every decision for the heroine, this is not the book for you.",1
"These series is for those that enjoy non-stop action military fiction. I enjoy these book, although nobody ever dies, they just keep changing helicopters, once, twice, three times in just the first two books. But then again, these are FICTION stories. Anyway, try one of the series and you will get hooked.",1
"For those who want a really violent and gory read, this would be it! Right from the beginning to the very end. I really think it could have been enhanced a great deal by the authors making it a bit longer and providing more insight into the two characters, what made them what they have become, how their minds are working.",0
"The story was going so well. I loved Raphael and Aleric, the pages just sizzled whenever they were together. But the story ended suddenly and I was shocked. I was expecting more, especially since it was obvious they needed to resolve issues with the head vampire and whatnot. Overall, good, intriguing and sexy but the ending is not a satisfying one for I felt there was still more to their journey before they can actually be at peace.",0

"I got this book based on a vague memory from childhood of stories I'd read about a &#34;Doc Smith&#34; (I thought).  Turned out these are not the stories I remembered.  I tried reading a few of the stories and found them not for me, but that's not the book's fault.",0

"This story (s) was so great!  Each chapter you learn something new about the characters that keep you wanting more.  Each chapter gives you a great story where you find out more about the characters.  Every chapter is easy to read and it leaves you wanting to know more of the happenings of Lord Winstril and Kern, not to mention Sir Knobby.",1
I enjoyed this Christmas romance.  I have it on my Kindle so I can revisit it anytime I want a re-read.,1
Get this book! It is an amazing read and you will not regret purchasing it. You will not be able to put it down once you do!,1
This short work is very disjunct and hard to read.  Much of the story is left to your imagination to fill in.  I prefer a more straight forward story line.  It needs some polishing.,0
"The first half of this story reads like an early Greg Egan, posing questions on topic ranging from the nature of our experiences, ethics of euthanasia to politics of drug control. Despite some part of exposition being somewhat flat, mostly delivered through monologues, the reader does get drawn into considering those problems*. The end, sadly, devolves into a plain vanilla cloak and dagger story of megalomania and corporate greed, but does leave the protagonist, and the reader with him, with a tough if a touch contrived dilemma at the end.Unlike some other reviewers, I did not have problems with pacing of the narrative. The plot does hinge too much on coincidences, but the characters are believable, reasonably well developed within the confines of the short form, and mostly free from stereotypes.I certainly hope Ms. Stein will provide us with a full length collection of works in this vein soon.*) As Edwin Schlossberg said, ""The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think.""",1
"Henry is a &#34;hero&#34; of the senior citizen group! Excitement, drama and a surprising ending. Thoroughly good time reading this one.",1

I hated this book it had no storyline just sex. A worthless piece of garbage.  I want the time I wasted back. Straight up trash . I want my money back NOW,0
"This is more like a chapter than even a novella. There's no plot, no sex, no animals, ... I don't get it- it must be a ""preview"", though I don't remember seeing that in the description.  I wouldn't buy the book, either, if this is a preview.  It's a high school-drama book.",0
"2 star, quality of writing okay, story okay, female character, if you can call it a character, is horrid.  2/3 through book and I know she has freckles, brown hair, has the same ugly brown dress on, and is angry.

"I really wanted to love this book, but it was very hard to do so.  I was an enjoyable enough book, i really like the plot.  However, i couldn't relate to the main characters, it felt like they were lacking something. It was a good story, so if you want something quick this is your book.",0
"In this present world I guess it would be nice to escape from the realities of life and live in a fantasy.  However, God does not work through fantasy but through good and bad times in the lives of real people. Not only did I not particularly like this story, I thought it was not well written.  It would have been better without its ""spiritual"" aspect.  God works througth reality and answers real prayers.  He is not a genie in a bottle!  Dumb story and a waste of time!",0

"I am an avid reader and a huge fan of Leah Brooke. Her books was the first erotic books I ever read and I placed her on my top ten author list for erotic novels. As far as I am concerned she is as good as Maya Banks, Lauren Dane, Shayla Black, Lora Leigh ect. However, this book, I am not sure what went wrong but this is one of her worst. The story feels incomplete like everything in the book was just thrown together haphazardly. I did not like Elizabeth, I thought she was selfish, unforgiving and a proud woman who made stupid choices as a child and then proceeded to blame others for her own mistakes. Her daughter although really cute was just so undisciplined and spoilt and her mother had no control. I liked Chandler but could not find a liking for Hayden (although I loved the names). What could have been a great book just flopped all around.What attracted me to Ms. Brooks books was the way she develops the relationships between her characters. She took her time with each character and you get to know them, you relate to them. I also loved the way she develops her characters romantically, sexually, mentally and emotionally and that's what attracts me to her writing and her books. This is not the norm for Ms. Brooks. I believe ALL authors have a few books that are not going to be good and I believe this is one for Ms. Brooks. I hope to continue reading her books in the future. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book.",0
"I thought this was a good book and the writing was very good. If I have a criticism, it is that some authors like to make their main characters suffer a little too much and this author is one of them. Other than that, it is a very good read.",1
"This third book of the trilogy doesn't disappoint.More action... rushing against a timetable to find a balance for the magic so that people aren't destroyed. Trying to bring all the different species to an accord, and keeping the magic balanced is a hard act, even for a Delver who has experienced many things and grown much.There are love stories mixed in with war and battles.The characters are still interesting and this world is still most believable. This book is a great finishing touch to a great story!I highly recommend that anyone who likes a Fantasy... read this Fantasy trilogy. It's a great, epic story.",1
"Silly me, I didn't realize that this was just a quick look into the background story before what will take place in the yet to be released My Soul To Take.It was interesting and got me hooked, but then it was over.  I still had questions about Kaylee and Lydia and I'm not sure if those questions will be answered in the next book, but I will probably purchase it and find out.It's free, so nothing to lose, but just be aware that it is just a teaser to get you hooked into the series.",1
"This is a sweet story covering the challenges facing a girl's unique journey to knighthood...and more. The book covers Aislinn's years from 1155 to 1169 AD.Aislinn is a determined young girl of 8 when she seeks permission to train to become a lady knight. The King agrees to a probational two year period and her work and struggles against prejudice begins. The King allows another young girl, a street ""rat"" to train too. Instead of helping each other the girls are jealous and distrustful. Unlike the other outgoing girl, Aislinn, who has some reading and math skills already, has few friends among the boys.  She is lucky to get Geoffrey, a friend of Caelan, as a mentor and Prince Caelan himself as a silent watcher/companion.As the pages grow to squires they grow closer together and Aislinn finds others to help her with the areas that she needs help with. The ""brain"" helps her with math. The stable master tries to help her when she is assigned a beautiful horse who just won't respond to the reins. She figures out that she needs to start from scratch to train Dream Rider without saddle trappings and finally she makes head way.  Aislinn even takes secret weapon training from a mysterious Shadow Warrior, Ryu.  These warriors are not trusted by either Arnhems or Speicans and had something to do with the war between the two nations.Slowly the other pages and teachers learn to respect Aislinn for her unyielding determination in tackling her challenges.  Aislinn struggles with her emotions as well as her mental and physical training. As she matures she also has to struggle with conflicting desires between her dream to be a lady knight and her growing feelings and friendship with Prince Caelan who is destined to be married for political and royal position.Prince Caelan is quiet and intense. It is clear he likes Aislinn from the beginning even if they seem to quarrel and set each other on edge. He admires her and tries to help when her stubbornness will let her accept help. But he is the Prince and is well trained to understand his duties which will include marriage as arranged by his parents. He struggles with his clear feelings for Aislinn which conflict with the duty to his position.This book is the author's debut novel. Although I feel the writing could use a little more depth, which I think will come with experience, the story concept, plot and action are sound. Also the book seemed well researched offering some interesting insight in the life of pages and squires. It is an easy going story with sweet primary characters, harsh villains, plenty of action, emotional stress, dangerous enemies, battles and magical mysteries. At the end of the book there are still open questions to be further explored in the next story in the series which I am confidant will be another lovely read.",1
"This book ended quite unexpectedly for me. I'll admit to it being a good story with characters you were interested in and points of view you might never have considered, indeed the writing was at an even pace that made you want to turn the page. And in a style that expected you to make your own mind up about events and conclusions, it was an interesting read ...and yet it lacked any credible answers or explanations as though it were only part one of an incredible story, and that part two would follow to tie up any loose ends.  The end therefore was disappointing, but I think the premise was good.",0

"A girl and her 3 guy pals, just jump into it. Charli finds herself on a decidedly decadent shore excursion, playing ""The Race Erotic"". With each sexy challenge, it becomes clearer that down deep, she desires not one, not two, but all three of her remaining single buddies. She definitely wins the race.I wish this was stretched out more.  Scenes of erotic sex seemed a bit fast, and rushed.  Slowed down and expanded this would be a more wonderful romantic story.  It pushes my boundaries when she writes about the Man-on-man scenes but they are romantic, sexy, and in a menage situation, and very well done.",1
"I liked this book a lot the first time I read it, but the second time through, I am not quite as dazzled by it. It seems strange to me now that Nick is such an extrovert, even during the period of time that he is being raped repeatedly by 2 different people. He has one guy raping him on the way home from work, and another waiting to rape him once he gets home. He has a happy-go-lucky personality as if nothing bad happens in the world, even while the worst things in the world all seem to be happening to him. Unrealistic. Meanwhile, Brandon feels unworthy because Nick is in college, and Brandon's a high school drop out, no job, no prospects. He wonders why Nick would want to be with him. I started to wonder myself, after all that whining. Brandon really has nothing to offer in this relationship.Also, once Nick and Brandon actually meet face to face and fall in love at first sight, so many bad things happen to them all within a week or two, it's unbelievable.The story is told in flashbacks, switching from the present to the past, and while in the present, they also talk a bit about what happened in the ""middle."" It's the little snippets about the middle part of the story that frustrated me. I guess reading pieces of 3 different time periods is just not my cup of tea.It's still a good read, when I want to suspend my disbelief and experience an emotional story about a star-crossed kind of relationship where everything is stacked against them, and they try to overcome it. But I'd give it 5 stars if my disbelief were easily suspended by the story, without so much effort.",0
"This is the sort of cheesy vanilla* imaginary-boyfriend type porn where the guy says things about ""telling you what's been in my heart for years"" and then goes down on you.  You know-- ""Oh, I must look terrible, I've been crying and I have bedhead and I'm forty!""  ""You're always beautiful to me, my darling, and I don't mind if you weep for I shall comfort you in my warm muscular manly arms!""  Like that.  There's lots of sex, and even some language, but it's kind of forced-sounding in context, like this is the kind of lady who would normally say ""winky"" and ""hooha.""The dialogue is pretty awful-- ""I'd like to [blank] you until we're completely spent, Kayla"" is a fair sample-- and so is the narration (""As much as he wanted to continue, he also believed in respecting a woman's wishes"").Not one-star egregiously awful, but definitely not my thing.*Ew, that sounds really gross.",0

"This is Jules Verne's classic tale of undersea adventure, as best I can tell based on the 1873 translation by Lewis Mercier. Since that's been the standard English translation for over a hundred years, it's probably the one you remember reading way back when, and the edition you'll be familiar with.Re-reading this as an adult, and an adult who's spent twenty-plus years since then reading science fiction, I did have to remind myself more than once how amazing the then-future technologies Verne describes, like electric rifles, undersea diving suits, electric motors, etc., would have been to his contemporary readers; the book was first published in 1869, a mere five years after the Confederate submarine Hunley became the first submarine to sink an enemy warship (and sank itself in the process).  At times I found myself mentally substituting ""outer space"" for ""under sea,"" just to help me analogize the situation. Despite that,  the plot and action were as riveting now as they were when I first read it twenty years ago. I did find myself, now as then, skimming over much of Verne's extensive scientific descriptions of undersea flora and fauna, etc., but that might be my own failing as a reader -- when I did take the time to read Verne's descriptions, I did sometimes catch the same sense of aquatic wonder I remember from watching films like _The Life Aquatic_.From what I've read, the Mercier translation this is based on contains a number of translation errors, cuts out about 20% of the text, etc. Corrected, completed, updated ebook editions of this classic are available on Amazon, but they cost money -- I've been unable to find an out-of-copyright, corrected, complete, and free edition. For readers on a budget, though, this is probably the version you remember, and if read in the right way -- keeping in mind the era in which it was written, and skimming whenever the science gets too dry or detailed for you -- it's still quite entertaining.Verne did write a sequel, _The Mysterious Island_, also available in the kindle free store; the better translation is available here:The Mysterious Island.",1
This book is a compilation of short stories. To me when stories are short the plot should be developed quickly.At times this book lost my interest.,0
"This was an easy read - I finished it in an afternoon. A sweet story with very few twists to the plot, it was exactly what I was in the mood to read - light with a  predictable ending (which isn't a bad thing!) and everyone got what they justly deserved.The reason for the three stars is the explicit descriptions of sexual encounters that seemed to go on for much too long and seemed out of place in a story that is built around an angel, her angel guide and their mission to save someone's mortal soul. This isn't a preachy book - couldn't be considered ""Christian"" in theme, but the sexual explicitness tarnished the sweetness of the story for me. I skipped over a great number of the pages in  order to get to the next scene.There are characters mentioned in the story that were not as fully developed as I would have liked to see. For example, a maid was mentioned as having played an important role in the mortal's childhood experience, but then just disappeared with any resolution.Still an OK read for a lazy summer afternoon! I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to review it.",0
Badly formatted and some grammatical errors towards the end. disliked the jarring pov and setting changes... the characterization was very weak and boring.,0

"~ 1.5 Kidnaping Stars ~Kidnapping Casey is book two in the Zorn Warriors series by Laurann Dohner. If your a fan of forced seduction then this book will work for you. I did not enjoy it. To close to rape for my liking.Unlike the first book Ral&#8217;s Woman where Ral shows a genuine affection and protective concern for his human, Argernon dose not show these qualities for Casey until much much later in the book. Argernon is entirely shellfish and demands that Casey stay; because he can&#8217;t live without her. He gives her no choice. The same seduction techniques that Argernon uses are just like her ex who was trying to forcer her, and she should have told Argernon and he should have backed off and gotten to know her without the bondage. It felt like a broken record with the seduction your body wants me ergo your heart does too. Around 30% into the book we get some action outside the bedroom which was a change, but other then that it&#8217;s all about Argernon not letting Casey go.If you like to read a series in order then I recommend this book, but in general if your into overbearing alien men who don&#8217;t have a clue about women&#8217;s rights and like to use sex as a weapon to get what they want then you&#8217;ll like this, otherwise I would not recommend this one.",0
"This was not what I expected.  The first 3 books are tales of Mary, the mother of Jesus that depict her as having miraculous abilities such as Jesus had. They are almost dublicates of each other purportedly written by different writers, maybe copies of an original.  They don't agree with the Gospels, which is why they are not part of the Bible.",0
"I've read many books from Stormy Glenn. While hardly literary masterpieces, I hold them to an admittedly lower standard than I do other novels. They're fun and sexy and are very light, but entertaining, reads. While I normally rate her books between three and four stars, I gave this one a five star review because it did evoke some heartfelt emotions.Ryce and Saul are mated werewolves. They're deeply in love with each other. The only blemish on their relationship is that Saul heads into town every Friday night to seemingly ""sow his oats"". This slowly eats away at Ryce, and their relationship is gradually going down the tubes, even though Ryce is still hopelessly in love with Saul.When Ryce's frustration reaches epic proportions, he decides to head into town too to see if he can have some fun. There, he runs into Cary and recognizes Cary as his mate. Cary is a tri-omega, a werewolf assigned two mates to help keep them grounded. Once claimed by one mate though, a tri-omega must be claimed by the other in the near future, or die. Even after claimed by both, they must be continually claimed every few days or they whither away. Ryce knows a bit about tri-omegas. He knows that fate doesn't assign a tri-omega two mates without those two mates being assigned to each other. Since he and Saul are mates, Saul must also be Cary's mate, so Ryce goes and claims Cary. When Saul comes home though and finds Cary and Ryce asleep together, he's heartbroken and feels betrayed, even though he knows he's been putting Ryce through the same thing. Cary leaves Ryce asleep in the bed and comes downstairs to meet Saul, but the drunken heartbroken Saul is so jealous and angry, he sends Cary away.The is one of the better stories of the series. There's a lot of emotional angst. We have Cary feeling the elation of discovering his two mates and finally being mated, only to be thrown out by Saul and knowing that he'll die soon without them. We have Ryce who cannot abide by Saul's cheating excursions into town anymore, but still is madly in love with him. We have Saul feeling great self-shame over what he does every week and the fact that it hurts Ryce so much. And then we have the growing realization that whatever it is that Saul does every week, it's not cheating, it's forced upon him, and he must keep his mouth shut and let everyone think he's a scumbag for their own protection.There's some nicely heartfelt scenes in the story that surprise. Such as an argument between Saul and Ryce that turns into lovemaking, but during the lovemaking, it becomes apparent to Ryce that this is Saul's goodbye. Another piece of dialog that tugs the heart is a conversation with Micah, another tri-omega that can sense emotions. While everyone is sure Saul is cheating, Micah informs them that whatever Saul is doing, he's not cheating. Micah can feel Saul's love for Ryce, and it almost fully consumes every other emotion and is the driving force behind Saul. These touches at heartfelt romance to the story, elevating it above just normal erotica.It's a pretty complex tale that is sexy, romantic, exciting, and intriguing. It's one of Ms. Glenn's better stories in the series. I normally wouldn't give a five-star review to light tales like this, but since it does rise above the others, I passed on an extra star to it.",1
"Another hot story. Once again it centers more on dom than sex. I like more sex in mine. There are a lot of sexual things that lead up to the sex however which makes it hot. And once again she uses her size 18 female and the girl on the cover is no way a size 18. Good story, but I find I did not like the way she portraits the females reactions in both this one and A Spanking for Valentine. She made them a little too child like in some of their reactions. Anyway still good if you want a quick hot book.",1
"WELL WRITTEN AND A GREAT STORY LINE.  IT COULD HAVE USED A LITTLE MORE INTERACTION WITH THE CREATURES OR ENTITIES FROM THE FOG, BUT OTHER THAT IT WAS VERY ENTERTAINING TO READ",1
It was a great book and I was impressed.  A creative perspective on the way the other side thinks while still continuing a good story. A real page turner and I couldn't put it down.  Si bueno as Juan would say,1
"This book is a reissue of an old one; the author was born in 1910. It's of the era of, say, Nero Wolfe. The introduction was quite interesting, explaining who the author was and why he's been forgotten; I'd never heard of him.The language is a little dated at times, like calling a gun a &#34;heater.&#34;  I also made good use of my Fire's dictionary to look up words like &#34;deshabille&#34; and &#34;Canarsie.&#34; Still, it was well worth a look-see.",1
"Unfortunately did not like this book at all.  I found the plot to be dumb, and the writing was sub-par.  The ending was better than the first 3/4 of the book, but not worth the money paid.  Sorry Rhyannon!  Normally I love your books, but this one should have been scrapped.",0
"This is my fault,  I read the reviews,  I knew it was dicey,  but I so liked the concept,  gay doctor,  straight cowboy,  baby... surely such good ingredients should make something delicious... Well, sadly no.  It's flat, boring,  has no character development or time line.  It's so choppy,  like blog entries strung together,  there is no coherent story or time line there, characters come and disappear (Zelda? Steven?) and it's really badly written.  So even for $3,  it's a poor investment.  Save yourself the time and money,  find something better.",0

I would recommend trying Albert Simon's mysteries.",1
"Story wise it was a bit unbelievable,  She was expecting a &#34;toy&#34; party and ended up in a room with two men who rubbed her down, shaved her and placed &#34;goop&#34; in places they shouldn't have touched nor did she make any effort to really leave even after they took her down to the dungeon,  after all the times she screamed to be released what Dom would have kept her and then she continued to let him touch her. This Dom didn't give her a safe word nor did he release her when she was screaming to leave... Come on get real at least make the story believable.

"The week before she has to marry, in order for her family to buy a new roof, Bridget embarks on a last adventure. Dressed as a boy, she travels with her groom's representant, Ian, to Doom's castle. She soon discovers a smuggle operation, a plan to kill french refugies, escapes (twice) from rape, gets sick, shot at, kidnapped, thrown from a cliff and so on...Amazingly, she still has time to fall in love and is almost (all but) seduced by Ian.I've noticed that the christian litterature reference was removed. I can only wonder why it was ever there. For a well-brought virgin, Bridget is certainly fast, to say the least. There are no christian value anywhere in this novel, from begining to end.Dont't get too excited about the prospect of sexy scenes. Yes, they are frequent, but really boring.The dialogue is so bad, it's actually very funny which is why I gave it three stars. I couldn't wait to see what ridiculous thing Bridget would think, say or do. Taken as a joke, this book is quite entertaining. Otherwise, give it a pass.",0

"I like the book and will read the others but the word usage and constant typos are distracting. At least someone should proof the manuscript before it gets this far. In the way distant past these people were called editors.Seriously, the errors come so often that it is actually difficult to follow the story sometimes. You find yourself looking for the next misuse of a word like ""there"" instead of the proper ""they're."" I mean this is pretty bonehead stuff and either show someone really just typing instead of writing or someone who is displaying a real lack of education. This happens pretty much every page.",0
Gena Showalter is one of my favorite authors.  This was a great story even though it is too short.You rock Gena!,1
"I'm fairly new to the angel thing, but after having read and reviewed 2 other angel book before (and loving them), I jumped at the chance to read another.Serenity is a witch who somehow calls forth an angel (Apollyon) to seek revenge on her unfaithful ex-boyfriend. Great premise. The execution, however, left me wanting.I'm usually quick to accept the love at first sight thing when supernatural/other worldly forces are involved (angels/demons/vampires/werewolves/etc), but this wasn't a case of love at first sight, mating, or any other supernatural love-mojo. Yes, they were attracted to each other, but it wasn't love and he continued to insist (in his thoughts) that he didn't know why his fellow angels would fall for human women.They were only together for a day until they were bumping uglies (which isn't entirely unheard of - several people engage in overnight relationships) and ""in love"". That part was a little too difficult for me to accept, despite the angel & witch aspect.And the revenge that she wanted against her cheating jerk of an ex-boyfriend? Was just to make him jealous by going to a club and dancing provocatively with her angel. Felt a little too much like high school to me.I didn't feel the chemistry between the characters, and while I understand that this is a novella (which means word count restrictions), I didn't feel that the story was fleshed out enough. Maybe if it had been longer and the characters given more time to get to know each other (or have a supernatural force pulling them together like the werewolves' mating instinct) I might've liked it better.",0

They only feel regret over they are proven entirely wrong, and only then seek to find her? I can't recommend this. It is one of the worst things I have ever read, and it came from Maya Banks? They left their dying, raped mate to die? No. You want this to be the conflict, you better offer some legitimate resolution, not some half-assed tail between the legs bs. I am furious after finishing this. If I hadn't read anything of hers prior to this, I would never read anything further by her. What went across her mind when she published this? Challenging the reader to have less than perfect heroes? They are the villains! They are almost as bad as the hunters that raped her in the first place. There was nothing romantic about this story. I don't know if I can any more emphatically urge you not to read it.",0

"I couldn't even come anywhere close to finishing this book it is so bad.  I'm a huge Jane Eyre fan and was looking forward to reading this. What a disappointment.I felt a premonition at the very first sentence of the preface: ""Dear Reader, do you remember me?"" Then came a recital of the events in Jane Eyre. One of the most famous novels in the world doesn't need a recap. The fact that the author almost injures herself trying to imitate the tone of the novel doesn't help. And it is painful to read it is so awkward.It quickly becomes clear that the Jane in this sequel has a very low opinion of Mr. Rochester and an inflated opinion of herself: ""I was pleased to see my generous nature was influencing my companion's tendency towards pettiness, and the marriage ceremony only ten minutes old!""She gets mean on their wedding night, blowing hot and cold for no reason. Then, after 4 months of marriage she becomes a resentful shrew who feels that her husband is selfish and though she has gone out of her way to serve him without his asking her to be a slave (she even tastes his cherries before he does to make sure they're not too tart!) feels put upon, feels that he has nervous fancies and is ""not cruel, but merely conjectured my service to him was a pleasure."" Then she gets ticked off if he takes any time away from her. Sheesh.Finally after treating the poor man to a series of mood swings and pettiness (she's even upset that marriage doesn't improve England's climate for her) that cause him to withdraw she says: ""What his struggle was that took his attention from me I could not ascertain by a survey of his pagan mien.""!!!That's it. 12% into the book and I couldn't take this crap anymore. Because the rest is surely as bad or worse.  I wasted 30 minutes of my life that I will never get back.",0
"This is my first Lori Foster book(s) - great story about 4 brothers - haven't finished reading about Jordan yet but decided to give a review.  Romantic, good story and great characters with lots of humour.  Think my Kindle will be checking out some more of Lori's books.",1
"Adrian is such a damn goofball, ""but my mate is inside."" He ran his hand over her bottom. ""Hmm, a thong? I love thongs."" He sighed happily."" Like Max and Simon he's a possessive one when it comes to his woman, ""mine,"" he growled, spilling inside her, his teeth clamping down on his mark once more."" Although I liked this book I have to say I liked Max and Simon's more.",1
In a fantasy land where vampires help humans to defeat an enemy from another dimension.  There's plenty of fighting action along with romance between vampire and human.  The characters were well developed so you could understand their relationships and emotions. This book is a great beginning to a series!,1
Ok the first review with a two star rating had nothing to do with the story so let me tell you why I am giving this book a two star rating. First there isnt enough of a character development for me. Also the usage of sighs and giggls along with the word methinks got annoying. The characters were always sighing for this or sighing for that; it was in every chapter as well as giggling at the wrong moments and methinks were used way too much. Also as that reason sounded a little bit redundant so did some of the story when the characters would explain something they sometimes do it twice but worded it slightly different as if the authors forgot they already had it in the story causing the story to drag. Also the actions of the characters didn't make since to me either.....spoil alert.... the parents of the heroine jump to conclusions and don't believe her when she had been forced upon by her cousins intended calling her a whore.  Also she is seen unchaperoned by multiple people with the hero when they were hiding their relationship where I might add there was no romance development... anyways she was seen and even recognized by the king himself but never becomes ruined even when her father finds out. Instead he beats her in the street for all to see and apologizes later in the story like he isn't a bad guy and she accepts his apology!!!! Oh and when they run off to elope it takes a while for it to happen instead of eloping right away?? There were just way too many issues with this book for me. I don't recommend it.,0
"PJVs QUICKIE POV: A smoking hot threesome packed full of vamps, determined heroines and two not just one sexy men.REVIEW: Set in the year 2069, in this futuristic world vampires frolic in all types of sensory explicit behavior at clubs called Midnight Playgrounds. The London club has been calling to Nissa ever since she found out about them. Determined to gain entrance to the club and maybe one day even into the ranks of the undead, Nissa finally makes a contact that gets her invited.On her fist night at the club, Nissa is intent of full-filling her most darkest fantasies - and the Midnight Playground is just the place to do so. Drawn to the upper floors Nissa comes upon Hex and his maker Aleron. Lovers and friends for 10 years they have had no desire to add to their ranks - only to have fun with the humans that visit the club.Nissa immediately strikes them as different thought. Intelligent, sensual and beautiful, Hex is drawn to her like no other - and while he has shared The Seeking Kiss, blood exchange between a vampire and their human lover, with others, he has had no inclination to share the Turning Kiss with one, until now.Interesting and sexy, I did enjoy this one and hope to read more from Ms. Bradley. I found Hex & Aleron's relationship very sexy and a change from the usual - buddies sharing a chick - which is what I've read before in menage erotica.Another short read, and a very cheap listing, on amazon.com for $2.80 here. I love a good book deal!RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, this is a smut fest, erotica novel. Vampires, threesomes and a lot of slaps and tickles.",0
Yet another book that is marketed as BDSM yet you need a magnifying glass to find the kink in this one.It's a sweet little fluffy tale but so implausible that I can't really recommend it. If you want a 30 minute read that doesn't strain your brain then this is the short for you. If you like a believable plot; decent character development; & a realistic development of the relationship; this isn't the book for you. Not dreadful but definitely forgettable.Originally posted on Goodreads.com,0
One of the weirdest SHORT stories I've ever read.  The whole thing reads like a drug induced hallucination.  I shan't read anything else by this author.,0
"I bought this charger for my Kindle 2, since the plastic around the wire of the original charger just keeps shredding.  It works well, although my kindle frequently resets itself when I plug it in.  This may have more to do with the age and use of my kindle, rather than the charger.",1
"this book is very touching as in you knew that deep down that the charcters loved each other, no matter what because overall love conquers all in the end. I wished the males could have been detailed more of their back ground but all in all good book. idk it felt like it was missing something from somewhere but maybe thats just me, it started from a different place especially of this kind genre, which i liked alot, like some of the others wrote you don't really read about the ups and downs during arelationship over the years. all in all good book",1
This may be a gfood book. I don't know there are too many editing errors for me to read it. If updated I will read and give a nother review.,0
"THIS is why I love my Kindle...three great books for the price of one.  After reading the reviews I thought the Julia Grey trilogy would be worth reading, and for $10 I was willing to gamble on the omnibus edition.  It was a good bet.The Julia Grey books are hybrid mystery-romances set in the Victorian period, best suited to readers who enjoy both genres.  Mystery is the dominant element in each book, but the romance between Julia Grey and Nicholas Brisbane is the backbone to the trilogy.  The slow, methodical development of the mysteries is nicely counterbalanced by the tempestuous relationship that develops between Julia and Brisbane.  The writing is elegant and rich, and it was a real pleasure to immerse myself in it.The omnibus contains all three books in the trilogy:SILENT IN THE GRAVE - This introduces us to our heroine, Lady Julia Grey, and begins with her husband's murder.  As the winning first line of the novel tells us: ""To say that I met Nicholas Brisbane over my husband's dead body is not entirely accurate. Edward, it should be noted, was still twitching upon the floor.""  Julia had been quiet, obedient, and dull all her life - the freedom of widowhood sparks a journey of self-discovery.  When Julia realizes her husband was murdered, more than a year after he died, she is determined to find the killer - no matter how cold the trail.  To succeed, she needs the help of Nicholas Brisbane, the private investigator her late husband hired before his death to investigate a series of ominous threats.SILENT IN THE SANCTUARY - This second book takes place at the family seat in Sussex, a converted abbey in the dead of winter.  The novel is richly atmospheric - a holiday party is trapped inside the fantastical gothic structure during a terrible snowstorm.  One among them is murdered, and another must be the culprit.  There are gypsies, ghosts roaming the stone-flagged halls, secret passages, impecunious relatives and a talking raven named Grim.  But SILENT IN THE SANCTUARY turns these gothic cliches on their heads as Julia and Brisbane race against time to find the murderer before the snow melts.SILENT IN THE MOORS - Like the second book, this one picks up - and transforms - a cliche: a dark, ominous, half-ruined estate in the northern moors of Yorkshire, capped by a rotting manor house, where dark family secrets fester.  Brisbane has acquired the estate, and his letters back to London indicate that something is very wrong - although he won't say exactly what.  Julia makes the journey north to investigate her relationship with Brisbane, and provide what help she can.  She's soon caught up in a proper mystery, featuring a family of aristocrats ruined by pride and a pair of mummified corpses hidden in a monk's hole.I devoured the trilogy.  The atmosphere of each book is wonderfully distinct and Raybourn does a wonderful job setting the scene - it's full of rich period detail, and everyone has a story to tell.  The whole cast of characters is magnificent, including every single member of Julia Grey's rather large family - she's one of ten children.  Although I sometimes solved the whodunit a little early in the story, Raybourn usually isn't content with just one crime: there's usually a tangle of them, and always had to wait for the end to see every detail unraveled.Brisbane is a dark, dangerous, mysterious sort of hero - easy to fall for, but terribly frustrating.  Sexy as he is, at times I really wondered if he was worth the trouble.  The romance is stretched out over all three volumes, and Julia and Brisbane's relationship is at least nominally professional - readers will be panting after the cracks in their professional facade.  At the end of the day, I still wished Brisbane had been a little warmer - and I am usually a big fan of brusque, brooding heroes.I started the trilogy expecting something along the lines of Dorothy Sayers, but the homage was really towards the Bronte sisters, Gothic mysteries, and maybe a dash of Sherlock Holmes.  All in all, highly recommended.",1
"This one is an odd one for me to review. The book was good. The story was a little off (for me) for some reason. After thinking about it for awhile I think it was because we do not really learn a lot about Will until the end and so he seems off center just a little. He was a very sweet loving guy and honestly with this story you would not want him any other way. Jenny was a very realistic character in her insecurities and as a survivor. I feel the author did an excellent job in describing the rape scene. I was devastated for her, it was very realistic in comparison to others that I have read and it made me feel as if I was there.",1
I would recommend if you are trying to tie knots. All of the common knots are in here and some more unusual.,1
"I like a bit of erotica with my coffee but this left me cold.  Poor characters, no plot and humdrum sex.  No thank you.",0
"In a nutshell: If you loved Adam's booksThe Complete Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Trilogy of Fiveyou'll love this book!Zany twists and wry humor abound throughout.A relatively short, very fun read.",1
"After our children saw the latest movie based on Jules Verne's books, we decided to let them read the original.  The story moves a little slowly (normal for the time-frame and writing style), and there are some funny ideas about natural science, but the storyline is good adventure.",0
"Short and clearly a fanasy to be enjoyed as such, the characters were not very believable.  If you are looking for pure fun and fancy free, you should enjoy this quick and easy read.  If you are looking for a story with deep meaning, growth of characters or any cathartic experience, you should probably pass on this one.  The characters are both semi-flawed in their own ways, however, easily overcome by the characters.  The sister seems interesting but we get very little from her in the story other than to illustrate how polar opposite she is from the main character.  The hero of the story has limited dialog and you get limited insight into his thoughts or feelings.  The story could be further developed into a larger novel if a larger plot was developed.",0
Why does anal s*x have to be in or play a part of almost everything considered erotic.  I researched this book through reviews and the publisher's website.  I was so disappointed by this.  It is so hard to find great authors of this type of fiction.  I'm going to stick with Aliyah Burke and Zena Wynn.  You can create great erotic stories without anal s*x.  Because I don't want to waste my money on something I can't read.  I need a disclaimer or warning.  So I've decided to do what I wish someone had done for me.  Consider yourself warned.,0
"Well written and plotted, good world building and interesting characters.  Different story line makes for interesting reading.  Steamy relationship between the hero and heroine keeps you flipping pages on your kindle.Followed byPrimal Attraction: Pendragon Gargoyles, Book 2andPrimal Pleasure: Pendragon Gargoyles, Book 3.  All stories in the series are worth picking up.Editorial problems (proof reading errors) are minor and don't detract from reading enjoyment.Just wish there was a fourth novel about the boys sister as her story is clearly demanding to be written with the hints given throughout the trilogy.",1
"I usually enjoy books by Ms. James, but this book I found to be boring.  My attention kept drifting elsewhere.  I thought perhaps if I closed the book, and returned to it later, that this would solve the problem.  Nope...it wasn't that I wasn't focused...the story was just boring.  Even the sex scenes were blah...I skimmed them!!! I also don't understand why this is labeled as an anthology...there's only one story in the book, unless the excerpts of other works are included under the definition of an anthology.  The story ended at 88% of the kindle content.",0
"I could not stay with this one. I read the first installment and reviewed it favorably. So, I looked forward to this one with keen anticipation.Oops.Gone was the linear, cause and effect plotting that made the first book enjoyable. I couldnt follow the action in this one and found myself re-reading sections, trying to make sense of what I had read. Never a good sign when I find myself doing this.I gave up about 20% of the way through. I havent deleted the book and may come back to it and try again. I will update this review should I make it thought to the end.For now I would say that there is better vampire stuff out there and to feast on it, in lieu of this book.",0
I expected so much more for this book based off the others I've read. It felt scattered and forced and there just wasn't much of a story to it.,0
"For me I have no hesitation to give a 5. For me the only disappointment was it wasn't longer. I would have liked something like this to have been a full length novel. However that being said, I liked both characters, and situations and at no time was I able to tell who was writing what. Fluid story telling for me!5 out of 5 stars for this reader!",1
"Intriguing premise, the much-maligned and feared Helena crawls out of her coffin in the middle of her funeral; no one but her ex-daughter-in-law can see or hear her.Slapstick adventures follow.Very convoluted and totally unbelievable plot.",0
Punishment was painful but yet delightful. Not a lot to this little prequel. Lust and being forceful is the name of this game.,0
"Wasn't bad, wasn't good. It was free so I can't complain. There was a good story line but it wasn't very well written.",0
2.5 out of 5 stars. My favorite character was Eric ... he sounded like a great guy. The plot was good but didn't end up the way I wanted it to which is the reason for the low rating. I think if it ended the way I wanted then I would have given it a 4 out of 5 stars. *shrug* But if you don't mind reading a bit of m/m or m/f/m action then I think you'll be interested in this book.Review By: From Me to You ...

"It wasn't bad, and the price was attractive.  &#34;Lost&#34; is accurate, but &#34;masterpieces&#34; is a gross overstatement.Analysis:  It's not bad if you need something to read on a plane, but there is far better stuff out there in the same price range.",0
"I was a little disappointed in this book. I just kept waiting and waiting for them to discover who each other are, which they didn't until the very end of the book it was very annoying. I read in the other review how after they discover who they are ""sparks really fly"" so I was waiting and waiting reading fast so I could get to it so excited for them to find out the truth. After they did discover there was like 6 pages left of the book and 3 of those she was mad at him. I would have loved this book and given it 10 stars if they would have found out earlier and shown how their romance bloomed knowing that they were actually going to be husband and wife.",0
"It took awhile for me to purchase this book...it is EXPENSIVE!  But, I'm glad that I finally did.  It is a great addition to my Lisa Marie Rice library.  Alex was pretty hot and Caitlin was brilliant.  She distracted him beautifully and I could not put this book down.  It had some similarities to Port of Paradise, but I thought A Fine Specimen was better crafted.  I recommend this book, even with the large price-tag.",1
"I really liked the idea of this story, but I was unable to read it to find out if there was anything to it.  It started out very choppy, completely confusing, and just plain not readable. I removed it from my Kindle a little bit into the second chapter.The story starts with a lady burning a barn with animals in it. There are names of people that you have no idea who they are, and there is a thing that I think was supposed to be a ghost, but you don't get clarification on that either. The second chapter starts with more people that you don't know, and goes into attempting to kill an unborn child. At that point I quit. I did not know who or what was happening, and quite honestly I did not care to find out.Sorry to be harsh, but this was not something that I could even pretend to like.  I don't want to read about the smell of burning cows or the poisoning of pregnant ladies.  Great idea; crappy, confusing, gross and harsh presentation.",0

"There are times when I wonder how certain novels/novellas make it into print. After reading this very short novella, this is one of those times.The storyline was very dull and boring, the sex luke warm. I found the characters to be nothing special and overall, nothing in this novella stood out. The writing itself was also lacking.The best thing about this novella was the price. It was free and I can now understand why.",0
"The main character of this book spoiled the entire story for me.  She was selfish, self-absorbed and totally underserving of the hero of the novel.  She was not likable at all.  Because of her character's personality, the book just never seemed to end..... I was ready for it to be over long before the final credits.  Do something else with your time - don't read this book.  I'll give Ms. James another try but I hope her other books are more pleasant to read.",0
"I liked the creative ideas, the making and building of items.  The whole story was great...except for the killing of so many animals.  the book was written at a different time in the history of the world, the language is interesting to read and understand.  To distroy so much when now we need to save out plantet hurts  to read and think about.The book is worth the reading...as is all of this authors books.Naturally we would perfer he not kill the leading mystery man and the many life forms.The writer was a genuis.",1
"good to read,nice story have read this story line from other authors this was a very relaxing romantic book with enough intrigue to keep you interested",1
"Mm..mm..mm. Just what I needed. This is a very great book. It has comical drama, wittiness, love & hot sex. This book is a real page turner which I finished in 1-day. Tiffany you really are in tuned with what majority of us out there love to read. Excellent job! One of the reviewers had expressed disappointment about the use of strong sexual language in the book...AS IF! Come on readers this is the real world and whether some of us choose to admit it or not, strong language is used in our everyday life... both in and out of bed. This book was just being realistic about it. Tiffany did a great job at making the chemistry between the hero and heroine very perceptive....such that intimacy between them was explosive. If you love a great romance novel filled with witty characters and hot sex, then this book was written for you and me...as a result I trust you will also love the book &#34;Passion&#34; by Lisa Valdez. I like to take this opportunity to commend all you readers who take the time out to write reviews, I truly appreciate it. Shout out to those of you who in addition to your reviews also recommend great reads to others. You have the gift of sharing.",1
"Miss Firecracker is the love story of Blake West and Willow, the former Miss Firecracker.  The book begins the morning after Willow's wild night of celebrating the end of her year as Miss Firecracker, a restrictive beauty pageant title that prevented her from dating or other ""wild"" behavior.  Willow did some damage to the bar the night before, and rather than arrest her, or let her pay for it out of her pocket, the sheriff decided she must waitress at the bar, using her tip money to pay for the damages.  Blake West is visiting from out of town, and managing the bar for the owner that is on vacation.  The sparks fly between Blake and Willow from the very start of the book.  Blake sees Willow as a sexy, strong, woman and is not uncomfortable with her position as foreman for the town's construction company, unlike most of the men in town.  Blake is far away from the West/McKay part of Wyoming, so Willow knows nothing about his ""wild McKay cousins.""  Their love story goes quickly, with the conflict and resolution occurring in less than one week.This was a quick read, lasting only a couple hours.  I thought this was a fun read.  However, when comparing it to the Rough Riders books by Ms. James, the love story wasn't nearly as consuming and addictive, I think because it is told so quickly.  This could be read as a standalone, but I think the story is richer if read in the context of knowing about the McKay cousins (who star in the Rough Riders books).  In the Rough Riders books, the McKays all have roles and plots in the story line.  In this book, since Blake is in a distant town, he only mentions the McKay cousins, but you don't actually meet them.If you want some back story on Blake, I would advise reading Rough Riders book number 6, Branded as Trouble before reading Miss Firecracker.  Unlike many reviewers, I believe the Rough Riders books can be read out of sequence, because that was what I did.  I read one of the later books, fell in love with the McKay/West family and the Rough Riders series, and have since read most of the Rough Riders books.  There is another West boy story, Mistress Christmas that occurs chronologically before Miss Firecracker.  I read the West boy books out of sequence, and feel that it is fine to read Miss Firecracker without reading Mistress Christmas. Though, Mistress Christmas is so good, I think you'd enjoy reading that one.  If you would like both stories in a paper format, check out the bookWild West Boys, it contains Mistress Christmas and Miss Firecracker. I've read most of the books about the McKay/West family, so if you're curious you can read more about them in my other reviews.",1
"Quinn and DJ how perfect a couple. Sad stories of their pasts, but how they worked it out was great. A tender story that I truly enjoyed. I think Quinn is my favorite Haynes man!",1
I read one other slave narrative and enjoyed it. During the depression the government sent writers out to interview former slaves so we would not forget. I enjoyed it and finished the book. Interesting to read about slavery from former slaves/ There was not one person who claimed any abuse from former owners in this book.,0
"Although every aspect of X is described in exhausting detail - you can almost smell the odor when she urinated - I did not feel any real emotions or fundamental  connection to her. Added to that was the overt pretentiousness of the author, as she flaunts her extensive knowledge of the English language.I couldn't wait to finish the novel. The best part of the story, for me, was the twist at the end.",0
I read this book in just a few minutes and could not figure out why it was even written. Why would you write a story like this with no point? Great possibilities with no substance. It was like reading a diary with no end.I would not recommend this one to anyone.,0
"I downloaded EYE OF THE STORM by Monette Michaels which was a modern action suspense romance novel and enjoyed it so much that I went looking for more of her books and found this one.  While I have expanded my selections of reading material, my first love is Sci/Fi and this satisfied my craving.It is a fast paced Sci/Fi novel with both strong male & female Alpha characters with a lot of fights and battles.  Wulf was the ultimate Alpha male wanting to do nothing but protect his mate but having to come to term with the fact that with her experience & abilities, Melina was not going to stay on the sidelines.  While Melina is a kick-ass heroine and capable of taking down the bad guys she's not invincible and does have to deal with injuries.  Too many times in a novel, the stong Alpha female is shown overcoming the bad guys with only a few bruises to show for it.  In both novels that I have read so far by Monette Michaels, the Alpha females while able to deal with the bad guys are not invincible and are therefore more credible.The world building is fantastic and believable for a Sci/Fi novel.  As for Wulf growling - enjoyed it.  I like a growly Ultra Alpha male.The novel is more actions and a slow build up to the love scenes and I really enjoyed that part.  My problem with this novel is that I was very much wishing that this was just a start to a series and that there were other books because I really want to read more about Wulf's brothers finding their mates.  As of yet, I have not found any more in the series but I'm still looking.Update:  I found the author's web page and found that while this book appeared to be a start of a series that no more books have been published or are in the working stage.  This I found rather disappointing because at the end of this book the reader was set up for the next book regarding one of Wulf's brothers finding and dealing with his mate.  It makes me wonder whether the other book EYE OF THE STORM will suffer the same fate - a great start but no follow up.  This does not take away from the fact that I enjoyed both books but I did find it disappointing.",1
"The world Marlowe creates is imaginative and expansive, with nods towards more familiar stories.  Nicely put together and hard to put down.",1

"I've seen many Bulldog Drummond movies, but this took the gentleman adventurer much further than the Ray Milland image I had. I much prefer these stories of daring adventure and virginal maidens and an ugly but charismatic Bulldog who commands the respect of all he encounters.",1
Likeable characters and engaging story but the way the main characters suddenly became mates was a little too fast for me.  I prefer romances where characters work somewhat to get their happy endings since that aspect makes it more believable to me.  Still the characters here are very likeable and the story flowed well.  For the price of the kindle book it is a very good buy and worth keeping.  I will read the next story in the series and hope Amazon makes the third book available soon.  If not the third book is available at booksonboard.com.,1
"I like sentences with a subject and a verb--in fact, those are the two essential ingredients for a string of words to be called a sentence.  I don't mind chopped up bits in dialogue, but this book contains too many narrative passages with phrases passing as sentences.  &#34;White chocolate eyes with dark chocolate irises.&#34;  &#34;Set him down and started another.&#34;  &#34;Perfect.&#34;  These are not sentences, and every time I came across one of these it jerked me out of the story and made me wonder what sort of editing the book had received.I found the book's premise implausible as well.  Mysteries create a puzzle that must be solved with the clues that the author hides in the story.  A magic box and special powers belong in fantasy writing, not in a mystery set in modern America, unless you wish to create a magic world existing alongside or within our normal, non-magical one--like the Harry Potter books.  The author gives no rationale for magic of any kind, and it throws off the whole equation--it's a cheap way to cheat.  I didn't finish the book.",0
"I have to say that I really HATE vampire stories. I purchased this for 2 reasons; 1. I really liked Ms. Paulin's writing from works I read from elsewhere and 2. I was kind of excited to read a dragon story. I had no idea that she wrote what was basically a vampire-dragon story. It was written well enough that I read the whole thing, but I complained the whole time about the Vampire/Dragon part. I very definitely will not purchase book 2 of this series.Blood Bought (Cruentus Dragons)",0

This one did not do much for me.  I would only give it 2.5 stars but not sure how to change the rating - ha!  Quite frankly I don't feel like trying to figure it out either.  It was not a very long story so maybe there just wasn't enough character development.,0
this is pretty much smut masquerading as a romance... and it ends in another book altogether,0
"These stories were described as ""pulp"", and I would never have guessed that I'd enjoy them, but I did!  Immensely!  All 4 stories in this collection take place in the mid-1920's and have a definite 'feel' to them that is characteristic of the era.  Most of the mysteries set in this time period in Britain tend to focus more on the lives of the (usually upper-class) characters and only secondarily on the mystery.  These books put the mystery front and center, and while Drummond is definitely upper-class in terms of being comfortably off financially and without a need for 'gainful' employment, he's not nobility and he doesn't hobnob with the landed gentry.  In our day and age, he'd be considered middle-class, and this gives the stories a sense of familiarity.There's a great deal of action, and violence - but it's fistfight and rough-and-tumble violence, not blood and guts like so many modern tales.  It's the violence of a refined, genteel world that still remembers the eye-opening shock of WWI as a salutatory lesson in man's inhumanity to man.IMO, the first 3 stories were much stronger and more likeable than the 4th, which is told in a different 'tone' and 'voice, but the tales themselves are very well done and interesting.  There's a common thread running between all 4 stories in this book, so they lead one to another.  All were excellent examples of the writer's art from the time period, and still have considerable appeal today.  Highly recommended!  There is also a volume 2  with 3 or 4 more books collected to show the further adventures of Bulldog (who I must say is an extremely likeable character!).Note on Kindle formatting:  Very good.  I couldn't find any issues with the first 3 books in this collection.  The 4th wasn't anywhere near as good - there were many OCR errors, which did slow down reading somewhat, though not to the point where the book was difficult to read.",1
This was a very disappointing book.  It seemed to be more about skid row relics.  I was hoping for more of the resident's view on Katrina and that type of review.  I did not complete this read and that is something I rarely do.,0
"I do not recommend reading this author, the grammar in both of her books is about 4th grade it really makes reading her stories very difficult.  I read her first book and thought surely the second one would of been cleaned up but I was wrong.  Like they say on TV don't waste your time.",0
"I really liked the idea, and the sample pulled me in, so I bought the rest of the story. It satrted off OK but just seemed to fizzle out in the end. Not even the revenge secen seemed th have much oomph. I was actually glad to get to the end, and relieved it was a novella. There was nothing wrong with the writing style, but there was so much more the author could have done with this sotry to make it more cativiating.",0
That one word describes everything about this book.  The plot is trite and has been done to death.  Also this author has used every trite expression that exists.  Even for free I would skip this one.,0
"Quick paced, the characters learn to adapt in a crisis.Interesting story concept in a survivalist tradition.  Good character development, very believable.",1
I liked the story overall. a fan of lacey alexander so was looking forward to reading but the heroine was annoying and a total b***h. just didn't feel for her but i loved the hero. and be forewarned very explicit sex. the whole story was a very steamy read.,0
This series continues its downward spin in this poorly written book. The grammar continues to be subpar as is the plot and the story development.,0
"I MUST NOT HAVE READ THE SAME BOOK OTHERS DID  I FELT THIS BOOK MOVED SLOWLY THEN, HAD A LITTLE BURST AND THEN WENT TO A VERY SLOW PACE AGAIN  I WAS SO BORED I QUITE AT 65% AND I NEVER DO THAT!",0
"I have to agree with many other reviewers that the leading lady was a complete idiot. She was so annoying that I couldn't tolerate more nonsense after reading 27% of the book. If it hadn't been free, I'd be angry. Even though it didn't cost me anything more than time, I'm sorry I wasted that!",0
"This book had me hooked from the beginning! The characters were great, the sex was hot and I can't wait to read more from thus author!",1
"It has been a long time since I first read this in school, but I truly still love it; the nuance of the time, the language of th  time used, and all the time it took Mr. Dickens to write it. Strangely enough still see a great deal of the problems today they felt with then. I strongly advise  the reading of this book, the poor people who who always look to movies to learn a story miss so much in doing this!",1
Agatha is an old maid who loves science. Magnus is a widower who was horribly scarred in the same fire that killed his wife. When they bump into each other (quite literally) at a ball they both are startled by an attraction. When Magnus surprises Agatha with a marriage proposal without a courtship they both have to overcome their insecurities to find love. They keep misinterpreting the behavior of the other and in classic romance novel style it takes them forever to communicate their true feelings. I did like the element of mystery thrown in when it appears that someone is trying to kill Agatha.  There are some discreet love scenes within marriage but it's not explicit. Suggestive but not explicit. By the end I had forgiven the frustrating parts and smiled over the conclusion.,0
I enjoy good love stories and this one looked pretty good. It starts out slow with some promise  I kept reading to the last page and regretted all the time I put in reading hoping it would get better. Don't waste your time. It starts out slow and goes down hill from there.,0
i always knew that the story was far from what you find in the movies..i really enjoyed the book and can't wait to read to my boys,1
"I really enjoy shifter books.  This series has danger, mystery, and love ( but it is steamy not suitable for young readers.)",1
"I have just read the first half of this book.  While I like the concept, I have to agree with some of the one star reviews.  The conversation between Rick and Carolyn does seem too confusing at times.  Its like the author wrote this without realizing others besides herself would be reading it. (We're supposed to understand what's going on, even though she hasn't told us). While I can basically understand where she is going, I am often times lost in the dialogue.  I will finish reading because as I said I like where she is going with it.  The ebonics aren't bad, when you really look at how the rappers speak, it seems genuine.  For those who did not understand it, I feel for you.  With the dialogue as it is and then to throw in ebonics, I'm sure you are more confused then I am. I read books for concept.  The book is keeping me reading because of it.  I am wondering where she is going with this?? It's off to a decent, rather long start. On the concept, I give five stars, on the execution i can only give two stars, therefore I will settle for three stars.",0
"Nashville police detective Jack Riley is investigating a drug case, but changes venues to rescue mechanic Alexandra Morgan from the date from hell.  Following the murder of her brother, Alex has come to town seeking sexual freedom having worked under the close thumb of her father at his garage in Dahlia, Tennessee.Without exchanging names, Jack and Alex have incredible sex before going their separate ways.  She returns to her hometown as a good girl while he goes back undercover working the drug case.  A lead takes him to the Dahlia Speedway where his love of fast cars enables him to pretend to be a race-car driver.  When they meet up, each knows the attraction remains strong.  However, both share the same mission of finding the cold blooded killer who murdered her brother and his police partner.OUT OF CONTROL is fast-paced in the bedroom, the race track and several places in between as Jack and Alex prove the body can go from zero to ninety in nanoseconds.  The police procedural romance is filled with suspense and tension as each investigates related homicides until they team up as he fears she will be next if she remains OUT OF CONTROL; that is outside his touch.  Although the shared allure between the cop and the amateur sleuth never fully shifts into gear, readers will enjoy this heated romantic suspense.Harriet Klausner",1
"This was kind of a hit and miss book for me. There were parts that I really enjoyed, but other parts... not so much. The great part about this book is that it's sort of a story within a story. A book within a book. I loved that concept and I think it was executed quite well.As a fantasy novel there is the quest aspect of the story, and that takes us into a magical land with spirits, magicians, and an enemy of the queen who has his own minion army. One part of the book that is memorable, to me at least, was the Evil Army Recruitment Questionnaire. It just made me laugh (e.g. one of the questions was ""Do you like to play with fire?"" and the two options were ""Yes"" and ""Yes!"").Bethany, our main character, is quite young seeming and naive. She's hiding something that comes to light part way through the story and I just couldn't believe what I was reading. It actually really turned me off the book. I was enjoying the fantasy narrative, but then we found out about this secret she was hiding and it was absolutely insane. I can't be specific about it because it would be a major spoiler, but it just made me wonder where Bethany's brain was at, it was so ludicrous.Some scenes in 'Running From Secrets' seemed almost rushed through, while others were well paced and thought out. Therefore sometimes I was really into the book and wanted to see where the story was going, and other times I was a little bored. Overall I thought the book came to a pretty satisfying conclusion, and I think it's worth reading for the interesting story within a story and world creation.",0
Well woven characters and some depth. Excellent twists and turns to add interest and motivation.  This is the second time I've read this book and found it just as good the second time around.,1
Picks up where &#34;Murder on Old Main Street&#34; leaves off. Nicely written and held my interest until the last page.,1
"John Galsworthy (1867-1933) was a very popular writer at the turn of the 20th Century.  He was the son of a wealthy lawyer and studied law at Oxford. He became a solicitor in 1890 but never practiced law.  Instead he used his father's wealth to travel and learn about writing fiction from talented authors including Joseph Conrad.In the Forsyte Chronicles, Galsworthy created the history of an extended family that begins in the Victorian era in Britain in the early 1800s, extends through the Eduardian Era in the latter decades of the 1800s, and ends after World War I during the British social and economic turmoil of the 1920s.The Chronicles, now called the Forsyte Saga, is a trilogy of novels: The Man Of Property (1906), In Chancery (1920), and To Let (1921).  The fist in the series sets the stage with wealth earned through the driving motivation of land ownership by the founding fathers of the Forsyte family.  The actors on the stage have landed riches and establish social networks as cohesive as the royal family in England.  Even their relationships are governed by the limits of ownership.  Women are the property of their husbands and accept their roles with the reward of financial security.In Chancery describes the continued accumulation of wealth of the family obtained through careful management of money increasingly independent of private property. There is an unwritten family rule of 4% return on all investments. Social conventions begin to change in the story with the problems brought on by allowing outsiders into the family's closed system through marriages. The women become somewhat rebellious refusing to accept many of the subservient roles that were accepted in the early generation Forsytes.To Let traces the family's fortunes through the turn of the 20th Century as the newer generations begin to consume rather than generate family wealth. This is a time of social and legal conflicts for the family that disrupt the order of their traditional lives.  The focus gradually changes to the youngest members of the family who, because of the devastating effects of the World War, believe that there is more to life than hoarding of riches, commodities that can disappear quickly.  These Forsytes pursue artistic and social justice activities and use the family money to go their own ways. The 4% rule is not forgotten, but rather never known by the youngsters.I first read the Forsyte Chronicles paperbacks in the early 1970s as a young man just out of the U. S. Army after the Vietnam War.  I enjoyed reading and experiencing the stability of the family and social structure of British society in the novels, a real contrast to my life then in California.  I identified with the last generations of Forsytes in To Let, focusing on their individual self actualizing choices.After rereading the trilogy on my Kindle1, I now identify with the more conservative earlier generations of Forsytes described in The Man of Property and In Chancery. I appreciated the change of perspective as I approach retirement, and I gained insight through a life review by proxy. I can relate the work to other great generational novels depicting the turn of the 20th Century, such as Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks.The world is much more interactive now than it was in the Forsyte's mystical Great Britain, and social stress has taken on global proportions.  But the activities of making a living, maintaining family stability, and attempting to reach personal satisfaction remain great themes for the turn of the 21st Century.  I highly recommend the Forsyte saga to readers (especially Kindle readers) who will see that the endless cycles of social life continue and personal development is a product of these social rhythms.",1
"I loved the connection of all the brothers and cousins and how in every story one would pop up. Books/stories 134 where excellent, while 25 where just good. Still a great quick read. Full of love laughter and pain and joy.",1
this was different and new to me. it was a very good and cute story in it's own way. I won't lie it was a little bridle at parts not for the faint of heart but a good read,1
"REVISED 05-06-13: My initial inclination was to rate this set 4 or 5 stars until I realized it TOTALLY and consistently ignored Austen's use of italics in all her major works. Where Austen italicized a word for emphasis, this Bedford edition doesn't do so. Nor does it use all caps to equal italics, nor even before-and-after underlines (_like this_) the way some other editions do. When this was priced at only a dollar, some readers might have been willing to overlook this defect (if they were even aware of it), but now that the price has doubled to $1.99 (the same price as 2 superior editions in the Kindle Store), one shouldn't have to. I consider this a serious enough flaw to rate this Bedford edition only 2 stars (and as a fan of Jane Austen, I was sorely tempted to even rate it one lower).Some readers of this review may wonder why I consider this worthy of criticism. I do because Austen (whose wonderful works rate 5+ stars) was a true wordsmith; she meant precisely what she wrote and the manner in which she wrote it. The words she chose to emphasize contribute to the way she intended her stories to be read and understood. Since she is not excessive in her use of italics, when she does so it is significant to the precise nuance or witticism she is trying to put across. That's why it IS a big deal. Without italics, something of Austen is lost. Reputable print editions all have them; why not all ebook versions? Why not THIS one?Except for this defect the Bedford Park edition provides easy access to each title and to the chapters within each title. It provides the finished and unfinished novels plus a sampling of juvenilia. And the formatting is fine--except for the aforementioned lack of any indication of emphasis throughout (a defect which seriously mars an otherwise fine set).One can get virtually EVERYTHING Austen wrote for the same price ($1.99) from Delphi and from Palmera. (To see for yourself, type ""Delphi Austen"" or ""Palmera Austen"" in the Kindle Bookstore searchbox.) Delphi uses italics in 4 of the 6 major works; Palmera in 5 (so I lean toward Palmera). I did NOT recommend this Bedford edition when it was priced at only a dollar, and I do not recommend it now at twice that.",0
"Not a good book, could not even finish reading the first story, way to graphic! Would not recommend this book!",0
"I love Kallysten's stories and this one did not dissappoint. Everything was on point, cannot wait to read the rest of the series.",1
"The book has one slightly worried about the possible demise of the printed page, but it is all a bit of a lark. It would have benefitted from rigorous editing. There is some irritating sloppiness which made me consider the possibility of 2 stars only, but the plot was interesting enough to warrant 3 stars in the end.Would I recommend it to someone? Sure, if you are looking for an easy to read book that does not demand too much of you attention then this is the book for you.And keep on reading those paper print books!",0
This was a free e-book on kindle and it sounded good so I downloaded it. I haven't read anything of Pinters before so thought I would check him out. It is a very short story and apparently sets up for the next book. The author gives you a list of main characters in his other books and who they are which I found to be very helpful never having read one before. This book leaves you hanging but I am very interested in starting from the beginning of the series and reading a new to me author.,0
I loved theses when the first came out I think they are one of my all time favorite series and always will be,1
"I love this book.The writing is fresh, the humor sneaky and the plot is nothing like a standard old paranormal. My only complaint is I wish it was longer, but Treanor does manage to make me care about Anna and Joe. I don't have a problem with an assassin hero in this, and even better Joe never turns into a typical domesticated reformed man--he keeps his edge of danger.I thought I'd be squicked because, hey, she lusts after a crash test dummy .... but the heat works really well.After I read it, Marie Treanor went on my autobuy list and she hasn't disappointed me yet.",1
"...to the other reviews. They weren't kidding. This is bad. Really bad. Thankfully, it's also very short and, best of all, it was free. If I'd paid money for it, I'd be really upset.The author seems to be aiming for the fantasy-romance genre, but it reads like a clunky ""Letter to Penthouse,"" if that letter was written by a high school sophomore with a pocketful of cliches. If you need a primer on how NOT to write a story, this one is your best example.",0
"As I said, Silent Blade and Silver Shark are really quick reads, so I don't want to give too much away. So let me just say this, if you're looking for a new world to explore with a lot of hidden possibilities and characters that are not only intriguing in what they can do, but who they are, then you definitely want to pick up from Silent Blade and Silver Shark Ilona Andrews. Considering Silent Blade is only $2.5o and Silver Shark is $2.99, there's really no reason not to get them.  They are worth every penny.For my full review, check out Literary Escapism.com.",1
I wsih there was more to the story than what was given but hey its a novella gotta get more.,0
"I didn't even finish this. My idea of a good read is not reading about someone getting gangbanged. I didn't think this book would be that way. I really thought it would have been a little more in depth, with more story and not just pure erotica. But, that's just my opinion. Check it out if you're into that kind of thing.",0
Fast paced action drawing readers in and holding nothing back could have been a little bit longer towards the end,0
This book was a waste of time and money. This book even at $3.85 was too short. It was listed at 114 pages but only 82 were actual story the last 40 pages were ads. The writing was pretty amaturish. The plot had promise but everything happened in a rush. The story took place in 2 days and when the 2 girls found out these men were werecats they were like really? that's cool. Very little reaction was shown to something that was really a pretty big life altering discovery. They didn't seem to care that these guys turned them into werecats. The explanation of the shifter world was glossed over not delved into. The heroine discovered her powers in a shazam moment. All of the learning about being a shifter happened off camera. Stated not shown. I was disappointed all around and the instances of cute dialog did not overcome the defects of little character or world development and absurdly easy acceptance of magical creatures.,0
"Goodreads Description- When Macy Carter&#8217;s parents order her to bring her live-in boyfriend Sean home with her for Christmas she has no idea that her little white lie is just about to snowball into a fabrication of monstrous proportions. Sean isn&#8217;t her boyfriend, he&#8217;s her boss. Now she has to reveal the lie she&#8217;s been telling her family for the past two years or hastily concoct an elaborate ruse to fool them instead.When Macy tells Sean Mathis of her predicament he does what any gentleman would &#8211; he laughs and then agrees to help her out. Little does he know that one misplaced word in their little scheme will backfire and land them both in the hot-seat.Secluded in the mountains, surrounded by snow and good will, Sean and Macy can&#8217;t help looking like the perfect couple. So perfect that the family decides a Christmas wedding will make it a holiday none of them would ever forget!I must say that I only chose to read this book because a) I wanted a light holiday read and b) I needed to read a book with a book with a Christmas tree on the cover for a reading challenge.  It was also a freebie from Amazon and I usually go into the freebies with a little bit of caution because, at least in my experience, they typically aren't as well written as books that cost money.  It was also a novella, which is a hard genre to write because you have so little space to fully develop both the characters and theme.  BUT, even though it seemed to have so much going against it the author really seemed to prove herself as a good author.  I immediately felt a connection to Macy and Sean, the main characters of the book, and felt like the plotline, for the most part, could be something that would really happen.  I definitely didn't constantly spend time thinking &#34;There is no way that this could happen.&#34; which added to the books readability.  I liked the story line.  It was sweet and had a little bit of spice which was just what I was looking for when I chose this book.  I also think the Graison did a great job moving the story along at a good pace and was able to write enough and kept it from lacking holes in the plot.  When I was done with the it, I felt like I had read an entire book even though it was a novella.  That is a tough job, given the allotment space, and like I said earlier the author did an excellent job delivering an entire, fully developed story in less than 200 pages.The only thing that I would complain about the plot would be how the story ended.  I don't want to say anything specifics and avoid spoilers, but it just didn't ring true.  If anything, I would rather see a different ending with another novella to make it a series.  After reading the story as it is, I still wish there was more information on what happened to the character after the ending.All in all, I liked the book and would recommend it to someone looking for a light holiday read.  It was cute and reminded me of a Hallmark Holiday movie.  I don't say this to cut the book down.  I say this because this was what I was looking for and I found it in Blame it on the Mistletoe.  4 stars.",1
"Exciting, romantic and thrilling.  The story grabs you from the first page and hooks you in!

Charity loves Gabriel and has for years. After one bad night 8 years earlier both have backed of but neither of them have stopped wanting one another. Gabriel believes that what he would demand of Charity would drive her away and he would rather be her friend then not have her in his life at all. Charity is sure Gabriel is holding back but she is sick of waiting for him to decide what kinda girl she is. She is going all out to get her man if only once she has him she can hold him. Gabriel can see Charity as a good girl who deserves marriage the white picket fence and the whole nine yards but he is sure he isn't the man to give her those things because once she sees all of him she will run. It is funny to watch a grown man run from what he truly wants and a woman man up to go after her man. Great read,1
"I am going to attempt to remain professional throughout this review, but I may fail miserably. I have always had an interest in cryptozoology, so naturally when I saw this book I knew I had to read it. After having done so, I honestly feel like this might have been a rejected manuscript from the Syfy Channel.The writing is just plain bad. The story reads like the manuscript to a B movie and the plot is predictable. The opening of the book describes the creature in too great of detail. From that point on what is going to happen is rather painfully obvious. I do have to give credit for the cover though, it might be the very best part of the book.",0
"Muller is like many heroes written during this period, smarter than most people. That's a bit of a drawback, but the stories are well-constructed, pace well, and the writing style is quite good apart from the typical verbosity of this era of writing.

Not every escapade or turn in the plot was neatly solved as I'm sure would be in real life.  I really ""liked that.

"It is hard to believe this book was written by an adult. The premise was a good one. The mother of an autistic child, Kelly, is supposed to be 28 years old. Her sole term to describe the teacher she is falling in love with is ""adorable"". I counted that adjective at least 8 times.Her ex-husband is painted as evil, and he is sterotypically and unbelievable so. Kelly is rarely brave, mostly self pitying and spends more time worrying about her possible future relationship with a man than with her child. How sad, that she goes home from work everyday and takes care of her child. I thought that was what parenting was.She is rescued by the teacher, and his FBI friends, how convenient. He fell in love with her when he met her, having just been ditched by his platonic girlfriend of several years. Several years of cohabitating platonically?The views of dating, sex, love and parenthood seem to be written by someone who has never experienced any of those conditions, perhaps a 14 year old.

"I almost gave up on this book early in my reading but stuck with it because the action and humor got better from about mid-way to the end.  In the beginning, I found it hard to keep track of all of the characters introduced in the story and what role they were playing.At the end, I thought the story could have been better without some of the characters adding confusion and becoming bit players that got too many words (in my opinion) written about them.  Adding to this was the sometimes wordy style of the author and the silly actions by the players in the story.In total, the story was funny (with some bits where I outright laughed or chuckled) but felt contrived and too long.",0
I downloaded this because I enjoyed reading Poe in school and think it a wonderful addition to my digital library.,1
"Aislinn Campbell has done her best to keep from becoming too attached to anyone. Running from her ex has her moving from place to place after several months but for the first time she is unable to remain detached from the people around her.  To complicate matters even further, she's falling for her boss and has witnessed his death in a clairvoyant vision.Ex-Special Forces operative and owner of Turner Industries, Kyle Turner III, knows everything there is to know about Aislinn.  He's had her carefully investigated and he's perfectly aware that she never stays in one place for more than eight months because of her abusive ex. She's been his personal assistant for the past six months and he'd desperately like to get to know her on more `intimate' terms.  An anonymous email warning him that somebody would kill him in a kitchen gives him just the advantage he needs.Kyle's been very thorough in finding out all about Aislinn to the point that he even knows about her clairvoyant abilities.  Kyle's decided that it's time to show Aislinn that the passion brewing between them is too powerful to ignore.  Aislinn tries to deny him - and herself.  She even turns down dinner with him, until he uses his ace in the hole and mentions that if she doesn't go out to eat with him then he'll have to go home and eat in his `lonely kitchen.'  He has no doubts that the warning email came from Aislinn and isn't above using it to his advantage.  It's obvious Aislinn is as attracted to him as he is to her but her fears about her ex are keeping her from even considering any sort of permanent relationship.  Kyle's positive he can protect her  . . .  all he has to do is prove it to her.  Simple right?  Well, maybe not quite as simple as you'd think.Annmarie McKenna's TWO SIGHTED will delight readers with the fun array of characters, witty conversations, sexual innuendos, and enough suspense to keep you riveted to the pages.  I loved the intensity of the relationship between Kyle and Aislinn.  And I got a kick out of her friend Christina and Kyle's `groupies' as she refers to them, Jon and JT, playful banter and sexual interest among the three of them.  Ms. McKenna does a wonderful job blending emotional situations into the plot so that you genuinely care about what happens with each character and never want the story to end. Fortunately, Ms. McKenna does treat us to Christina, Jon and JT's story in her follow up book - THE STRENGTH OF THREE - which is currently available.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
"This free short story just didn't do it for me. I found it rather awkward actually and it shows that guys think more with their lower head than the one on top of their shoulders. It was written well enough, but I think the author could have done a little bit more with it. If there was a second book, I would understand. But there isn't, so I just don't know what to think.Ryan, a single man, divorced twice, is lacking some love in his life. That is until he finds a note on his car, receives a Facebook message and a creepy phone call from some random girl named `M.' They end up having phone sex. I can't imagine what kind of guy would do that with someone he doesn't even know. Then he decides to meet up with her and have sex in a pitch black room. I shook my head when the guy showed up to the sleazy motel. I thought this was going to be a good erotica gone bad. Sort of like a praying mantis taking off her mates head while they have sex. But that didn't happen. I think the book would have been better if that happened - just saying.This story is basically phone sex, then crappy real sex. Would I recommend you ask? No. That's all.",0
"The chararacters weren't very developed.  The side stiry about the horny robot was the best thing about this story.  I liked it, but I didn't love it.",0
"More Sweet tea is a collection of short stories that are all different.  Set in the South, it had lots of Southern Charm and Grandma characters. The stories are good length to read one or two while waiting for something else, or read the whole book for a fun relaxing, sometimes silly laugh out loud experience. It helps if you've lived in the South or know some characters from that region of the country.  I highly recommend it for some summer enjoyment.",1
"as per first review I bought one then the next two and have enjoyed them all, a bit long winded i bits but my favorite characters keep me going to the end",1
"Ok, they say this is a short story, but my Lord I didn't realize that s short story was shorter then my high school term paper.  It could have been a really great novel if the author had spent time developing the story!  It was a good storyline, but boo for Kindle!  they need to let you know when you are purchasing short stories.  There needs to be instead of telling us the freaking file size ALLmof the books should have what the print pages would be, that way there are no unhappy people from buying expecting a novel and getting a book report.",0
Gotta love K.A. Mitchell.  Custom Ride is a short short story over too fast but super fun to read and enjoy.  Recommended.,1
"This an easy mystery, relaxing and fun.  Anyone reading this wold surely enjoy it.  I love the police officer in the book and his family life.",1
"I don't mind when authors write a back story, but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond, when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring, and very repetitious, if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through, and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say, but no.",0
I enjoyed this book. The pace keep the action moving and the plot kept me interested. I appreciated the way that it treated the mid-eastern characters with respect.,0
"It got a bit weak once they left Australia, but it was diverting.  It went for a little longer than your usual romance novel.",0
"Do not misunderstand me I like Oscar Wilde but to write a novel ala Oscar Wilde is just too much. To be honest with you I did not get through half the book before I had to give up. However, if you like that kind of style by all means buy the book but it is not a book for me.",0
"Really just a collection of memories written by the daughter-in-law in the woman's own words.  Not enough structure to keep me interested.  I should have sampled it, then I would have known that it just wasn't what I was looking for.",0
I loved the characters and story line. The romance and love that flows through each story line keeps you interested and wanting to know more about each of the characters.,1
"I love these books.  Yes, they can be a bit too pat at times, the characters pretty predictable, but still... delvers, shags, cliff behemoths, river rogues, hook hawks, and many many more - you have to give credit for creativity where it's due!! I've read my share of fantasy and never come across HALF the creatures in this series.  I particularly enjoy the qualities of the delver!That is the ONLY reason I'm still reading them.  The writing is just atrocious. Then is frequently used for Than. Most compound words are separated: he said so any way, she decided to cook some thing, they rose above ground, etc.  It drives me insane.  There's also a lot of redundancy; the author doesn't seem to have a very large vocabulary (or a thesaurus!!): he remains standing among the remaining guards still, etc.  As you see, repeating the word AND re-stating the concept.  If he remains there, obviously he's there still, so why add it to the end and make it awkward?  Also, many sentences just don't make sense.  Either they seem to be missing words, they seem to have extra words, or they seem unfinished.There are still other grammatical/spelling errors, but this is getting pretty long.  As you can see, those things bother me a great deal. Imagine how interesting this world must be for me to continue reading! I'm currently on book 4, and I've marked 158 mistakes at the 23% mark but am still enjoying it!",1
I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a suspense filled mystery that keeps you interested from start to finish. My favourite  books are ones that keep me so engrossed I want to know more about the characters on the last page of the book and this was certainly one of those!,1
"I would have liked this book more if Jessie wouldn't repeat her thoughts constantly and if she didn't come across as childish and winey. It seemed that during and after every catastrophe Jessie was thinking of sex with Colton, typically while your being shot at you aren't getting turned on. After the fore mentioned shooting, Colton leaves her at her parents home and tells her to wait for him to return to guard her. what does STUPID do, she sneaks off. At this point I stopped reading she deserves to be gutted in an alley for her stupidity throughout the whole book. I feel bad that Colton would be saddled with such a nut job",0
First time reading this author she really goes into detail of characters and history of India. I will read more stories in the series  especially the one about the heroine's  sister. She did her best to destroy her sister's romance. I liked the last of the book better when Ash and her really became a couple and married. I was so glad in the end he spoke up for her and all the lies and rumors that have been told about her .They were allowed to keep the life they wanted after that.,1
"Wow, 1st time reading this author. I will definitely buy more of this. I thought the suspensewas well done. Kept me on the edge of seat. Romance good.",1
"Great story about men loving men & both loving the same woman. I almost got turned off by the start of the book, but am glad I kept reading. I don't think I could have done that if the book was strictly about a gay male romance. But besides the overly explicit love scenes it was a very good book.  Janice Mote",0
"I actually didn't finish this book.  Not my cup of tea, so to speak.  I really enjoyed reading the Steve Winslow books by Parnell Hall, read all five of them.  But Stanley Hastings was just not as enjoyable.  Perhaps I just enjoy the &#34;lawyer&#34; instead of the &#34;detective&#34;.",0
"This is the first book I've read by Cooper Davis, and it seemed...fine. I know that's not a rousing endorsement, but in this genre, it actually kind of is. I liked the two characters, Max and Hunter. They were sweet and fun. The story was another ""straight guy goes gay"" story. Those can be fun, but often feel very contrived to me. This one was fairly light on plot, too. There was a lot of exploration of, primarily, Hunter's feelings and fears, but no real conflict. It was also kind of sweet that Max could read Hunter so well, but at times it seemed almost intrusively psychic when he'd take one look at Hunter and say something extremely specific that exactly addressed whatever bit of angst Hunter was feeling at the moment. I think the thing that was the most distracting for me was that the book was written in the present tense. That's really unusual and pulled me out of the story once in a while.Wow, all that sounds like I didn't like this book. I did. It was fun and light. The sex scenes were nicely done, too. And it was perfect for a quick summer read.",0
"Nothing is clear. Too many things are happening, and all without any form of order. I don't know what the author hopes to achieve, but it is definitely not enough to read it again, or get to the second book (please not!).",0
"This book started off good, but somewhere along the way it got lost and went downhill fast. The beginning was really interesting wondering what is happening and who is doing everything. I loved the killers chapters and the way everything was slowly being revealed. One thing I did hate throughout was it was a bit too descriptive for  my tastes. Not horribly so, but enough that it kept making me stop and think really? Did we need that much detail in the description? It is one thing that can bug me. Like calling out every name band of everything - I don't need it. It always makes me thing of product placement in movies and tv - like is the author being paid to advertise for the brands?Besides the descriptive, I was enjoying the book. But things just unraveled about halfway through and the end...the end was just too much. Now I need to add some spoilers here so don't read ahead if you don't want to know. You are told how how the killer showed up at his house and he managed to get out of the handcuffs and get to his secret gun and shoot the killer, but not dead. Then when the killer shows up again he just happens to be right next to another loaded gun and he just happens to be able to again shoot the killer. It was just a bit much. My husband was just like what? He just happens to have loaded guns all over the place? Yeah. One gun okay - the shotgun that was his dead fiances....that I am not buying. Then I told him what happened after that and he was just like wait...the book isn't over yet? I said nope - it just keeps going! Really it went on too long. Like right after that maybe have an epilogue chapter where you sum up everything, how he went to get help and moved to NYC to be with the lawyer lady and how things are good now. I don't need to see him do all of that because...well because the story was over when the killer died. And the author should never try and write a sex scene into his books. It just didn't work. Yes, you don't really 'see' them having sex, but the way the scene was written was just incredibly awkward. Not the best way to wrap up a book, which is unfortunate since the first half was pretty good.This review was originally posted to [...]",0
"a bit short but overall a good read, loved hearing about the West cousins from theRough Rider series in there own series",1
"I really love the fine leather cases that are available for the kindle and which come in so many beautiful colors. However, I can't justify the cost--even if buying it with a gift certificate. Still, I needed a case to protect the kindle and this one fits the bill almost perfectly. It's soft but sturdy and well-made with good and smooth zippers and should last a long time.My only complaint is that, since it's black it blends in with everything and is hard to spot sometimes on a desk (with so many other black things), in the car, in the purse, in the computer bag. I'm going to have to do something to make it stand out. I wish that there were other color options for it. Of course, I knew it was black going in, so I have no cause to complain. At this price point and with this quality, there is no competition.",1
"I normally try to appreciate each author's voice and the story's individual tone, but none of this made sense to me. It went from sing-song to brutal -- or at least hints at brutal -- and I didn't follow much of anything in between. Bottom line: I'm bewildered.",0
Love this!  This book has several stories I had heard as a child and a few I had never heard or read.  Wonderful book!,1
"Sometimes I can spend a stupid amount of time browsing through books on Amazon and I am always on the lookout for new authors with good write ups. This is how I came across Grant McKenzie as I noticed his debut novel had pretty good write ups.I had zero expectations, as normal with new authors and was pleased that as I started reading it was very easy to get into the story. As the synopsis explains and the story starts out, ordinary guy Sam White leaves his job early one morning and arrives home to find his house burnt to the ground. He then receives a call from a man claiming his family are safe and will be returned to Sam if he complies with the killer.Due to the story itself it certainly doesn't take long to get into the story as there is quite a lot of action in the first few chapters. I liked the style of writing by Grant McKenzie as he seems to follow the same route as authors such as Simon Kernick which are sometimes short snappy chapters. Although that may be true, there was a certain element missing which made me feel there was something lacking. I just couldn't quite put my finger on what.The story itself had all the right ingredients and the writing was good, but for some reason I just didn't like the characters all that much. The further I got into the story, the more I felt like I had `read this type of thing before'. Admittedly I do read a lot of books but this storyline just had too much of a familiar ring to it.Don't get me wrong, I certainly enjoyed the book, but it didn't leave a lasting enough impression on me to really stand out from the crowd. On reflection, I think this time around maybe I relied too heavily on other readers opinions and maybe I just didn't feel as strongly as others did. I certainly wouldn't be put off reading another McKenzie novel and I am hoping that maybe with a more original storyline I will like his next book more, but for some reason this one just didn't grab me all that much.Overall certainly not a bad book, just one that didn't have that certain something!",0
"Being categorized as erotica does not mean a lack of plot and storytellling are a must.  In fact, the best erotica out there knows how to find the balance.  Even hardcore subject matter sexually can still have great plot.These &#34;Naughty Nooners&#34; are a disgrace to the genre.  I will be deleting all others from my Kindle as the ones I've tried thus far are just horrendous.Ok so some might say these are just a little fluff to get your blood pumping quickly.  I can't even see them accomplishing that.  Save your time and avoid the NN's all together.",0
"Let me begin by saying I am not an avid Sci-Fi reader. In fact, I normally don't read this genre. So why did I download THE ADVENTURES of ""John Carter on Mars"" - THE ORIGINAL FIVE STORIES? I'm not sure. Maybe because I had been reading H. Rider Haggard's ""Allan Quatermain"" series and saw a similarity between the stories about AQ and JC. Both are chock-full of adventure and nonstop action; take place in exotic locations: Africa and Mars; and both are easy to read while I jog on my treadmill. There are probably other reasons, but maybe they're of a subconscious nature.The storyline of ""A Princess of Mars"" (The first book in the series.) has already been mentioned, so I won't say too much more about it. Generally, though, it's a story about creatures who are always at war, the green Martians (ugly, very tall and unemotional) vs the red Martians (attractive, human-like and full of emotion).There is a lot of warring going on on the planet Barsoom/Mars with green Martians against red Martians and greens against other greens and reds battling other reds. Who, then, comes between them all and is captured at one time or another by both sides, wins some of their green and red hearts, is betrayed by green and red, imprisoned here and there, and ultimately...? None other than earth man John Carter, ex-captain in the CSA during the American Civil War, and unwitting traveler to this strange world. There is also a love story sandwiched in between the action and adventure segments. John Carter falls in love with the beautiful princess Dejah Thoris (red Martian) who is the reason for all of the above mentioned conflict.If you can really suspend disbelief and remember that this was written in 1911, then you will thoroughly enjoy reading this series. 4 Stars",1
"Have to say I enjoyed my first foray into Celtic Lore. Loved this because it touches on morals, staying true took your word and . Plus the magical twists made for a joyous swift read",0
"I tried, this is a better writer than most I've read lately BUT I was just sooo bored. It had a few really good moments but the constant misunderstandings were just annoying. Finally after two days of stops and starts I'm stopping at the sixty percent point.",0
"This one will made you verrrrrrrrry angry, it will show you love,sadness loyalty, despair, and above all hope.It will make you ashamed if you don't help stop the cruelty,it will break your heart and make you cry.Thank you  Ms Halloff for giving Sisypuss a voice it is one so many of us Need to hear.",1
Yes it is hot as far as erotic goes but the story was kinda off. I just could not get into the story.,0
"This was a mildly interesting, slightly humorous, day-to-day chronicle of a very boring guy's life. I found the historical insights engaging, and some of the daily activities of people in those days interesting. I wish that there had been a little more about the wider events that were happening beyond just the writer's activities. But, then, that would not have been in concert with the title of the book. The author certainly believed in truth in advertising. The title of the book says it all. It's a quick read and never complex.",0
"Another classic,, imagination and creative writing at its best.  I would wish every young person would read these books and have them in their own library.",1
"I picked this up as a freebie on my Amazon Kindle.  You can't argue with the price.  It is the story about what happens between Leslie, Niall, and Irial after the events that occur in ""Ink Exchange"".  The story is so-so.  Not a horrible read but nothing to write home about.Part 1 is a total cliffhanger, so download Part 2 at the same time so you can read it right away.  It's a very quick read; Part 1 takes maybe 20 minutes to read.Overall, it was something to read.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't enjoy it that much either.  So it gets an okay from me.  If you are really attached to Leslie and want to know more about her and her boys go ahead and pick up the story to read.  Just don't expect anything earth-shattering.",0
"This is an OK read.  Light, quick...some humor and just enough sass, intrigue and sex to make it interesting.  Wish the author had elaborated on or used a bit more of the 'room reads' concept to lend another layer but I guess that would make it too complicated.  It's one of those satisfying, quick reads that entertains enough without making you need more than what it is...the right chair, porridge and bedtime story...",0
"This book was a little slow in the beginning, but once the killing started, I had a hard time putting it down.  The kindle edition is a little rough due to some formatting problems, but it was definitely readable.  Williams does a great job with character definition and more than makes up for what the book lacks in plot.  The author's descriptions of violence are so well done that it is easy to visualize the gory details.  For fans of gratuitous violence, this book does not disappoint!",1
"its not the worse, but it had a childish feel - maybe im too picky but nothing I would recommend",0
"I was eager to read this novel and downloaded it at the time it was 0.99. Big spender I know but I am glad I did not spend more. I was intrigued by the concept and some of the scenes of college life are both surreal and funny. Though that is all the positives I have for this meandering book. I mean there is no Jekyll Hide scenario, no ON/OFF if you will, Its like the whole book is more off than on, there is one speed and it is slow. Jamie Pepper undergoes an experiment to battle a disease of the brain. At first it seems effective, but is it really? Are these strange dreams he is having or is he doing things he is unaware of? None of it seems believable enough to me to warrant the climax. I will say that the life in the dorm aspect is entertaining and funny, but the novel as a whole was a big disappointment to me.",0
"Just finished reading this book over two nights and the tears are still on my face. Emotionally this was a hard hard book to read, but one I had to read. The story, as told from the cat itself was incredible, well written, and totally believable. I have owned several cats in my life, all of which I loved, and should have treated better, and this book reminded me of them.This book tell the story of one cat, the main character in the story. It is not a fairy tale, it tells it like it is. I think even it tells it better than the fate of many cats who are used even today for animal testing. It has some good spots, and some truly sad parts that will make you cry.The book has left me very emotional, as it will do to anyone with a heart, not just cat lovers. This book is a stand out book, which stands above those I have reviewed elsewhere on Amazon. If I could give it 6 stars I would, because it truly deserves that. This is a book I think should be compulsory reading in schools, in the hope that it changes the way people treat animals for the better.Really worth beyond 5 stars, and a book that will probably stay with you for your entire life. You won't forget this one in a hurry.",1
"Angie was expecting to spend a lonely Christmas all by herself until she shares some unexpected time with sexy boss Ryan Tyler at the Christmas party.  When he asks her to come home with him, she jumps at the chance.  It isn't until he is ready to leave the party that Ryan remembers he really is having company - his pal Wade.  They have shared many women in the past, maybe they will share Angie too.When Angie and Ryan arrive at his house, they can't keep their hands off each other.  A knock at the door interrupts them, and Wade is suddenly on the scene.  For the first time in his life, Ryan has to face unfamiliar feelings, and the fact that he doesn't want to share Angie.This is a very erotic sexy story.  The chemistry between Angie and Ryan is to die for.",1
"I wouldn't have exactly called this a prequel because it's only a breath width's in relation to the rest of the series. It's not a bad story on its own.  I got this one in late 2009 for free for my Kindle and I just now got to it on my &#34;To Be Read&#34; pile.  It was short enough that I didn't mind the lack of chapter demarcations.  I get ticked when they aren't in longer books at least 4 times the length of this one, but they're nice in books that are 3 times this one's length.  If you like light suspense and a little bit of slap and tickle, this novella might be for you.  If you like other books that are about intrigue or mystery I think you should give this one a shot.  Have at it because I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Just don't expect a hugely fleshed out story for one this short.  I can't wait to read the next one.",1
"Again with the BDSM. Not much of a story. Characters cartoonish. The only reason for writing this dreck is to show how a woman should be punished during sex, and the 17 year old virgin is supposed to like it!  A four way sex scene would be difficult to manage, and that's not what bothers me. Using someone and calling it love bothers me. If you like books that describe sex as a violation, then you will like this.",0
"If you can move past how quickly they fall in love, it is a good story. Damsel in distress with a brother who takes advantage, two cowboys, one who thinks he is too rough for her and throw in a couple of different bad guys that are after her because of other people....Some drama, some hot sex and a happy ever after",0
"A bit too much sex, but I really enjoyed the story.  It's not an easy decision to come out of the closet, especially when you're already famous.",0
"Not bad, but not memorable. A really good read makes you smile even a few days after you read it.",0
I love how the he rescues here in so many ways. I love how he falls for her amd her baby.,1
"This mini-novel was a romantic read with a HEA. The whirlwind romance of Carlo and Estrella quickly moved from pain and disillusionment to true love. I wanted the characters to find happiness together. Estrella's desire to help the orphan girls in India had me cheering and Carlo, once he realized his error, was a perfect knight in shining armor. It amazed me that Jane Porter was able to convey so much emotion and romance using so few words.",1
Really did not find anything interesting in this.  Thought it would be fun and useful.  Not happening.  Most (if not all) ideas can be found searching the internet.  Vague instructions and to many spelling errors.  Would NOT recommend this book.  Honestly don't think it ever saw an editor. Author needs to learn the difference in piece and peace.,0
"I liked the story,but I was thinking you said she said they said ,said said too much. It keep reading in my head. But I ENJOYED the story.",0

"Mia is in love with Ty and is willing to try anything to get him to see her differently than his sweet friend.  Ty is looking for a ""sweet thing"" but he wants her to be dirty in bed.  Will Ty ever be able to see the sexy side of Mia?  I really enjoyed the characters Lacey Alexander developed but there was too much that wasn't quite right for me in the story.  First, the book has a lot of sex that could have been steamy but it felt to me that too often Ty's reaction to what he was being told to do was negative. Second, I'm not sure I buy Ty' s declaration of love at the end...maybe...but it bugs me...it's like I was asked to flip a switch and now he loves her because of one realization.  I really wanted to like this book more because I really enjoyed Lacey Alexander's book French Quarter.  Ty played a role in that story and I liked his character so I wanted to read his story.",0
"I downloaded this for free on July 4th and honestly; I could not finish it. I read three chapters and I was done with it. I like erotic but I love werewolves more, and I didn't feel the connection of werewolves whatsoever. The cover picture would have been better if it actually depicted what was in the book, and leave out the wolf.  Disappointed? Yes.",0
"If My sister asked me if I had the opportunity to do the naughty with a guy who is there to protect me, my answer would not have been &#34;No!&#34;, and then I turn around and do it. LOL!Seriously, Kate's sister was like (Insert valley girl voice) &#34;He's hot, have you two gotten down yet? Because, you know me, I'm a skank, and I totally do it all the time. Because you know, our dad want's us to, it's the shapeshifter way.&#34;Kate: &#34;Oh no, I would never do that.&#34; Huff, puff. &#34;But sense you brought it up, I guess I will.&#34;And that was right at the beginning.The story didn't get off to a good start, and it just went downhill from there.I began to wonder if they were ever going to get out of that stream. And I'm sorry, but if I was floating/swimming into whitewater rapids, the last thing I would be thinking about is my impending orgasm. And that sure wouldn't take precedence over my LIFE!These far fetched stories are really getting on my nerves. And these Naughty Nooners are notorious for it. Of course, I have found one or two that actually were good. But wading through all this smut is getting to me.READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!",0
"Mediocre characters combined with a mediocre plot add up to a mediocre read. I probably would have given it 3 stars just for the characterizations of the dogs (which were good), except for one annoying habit of the author. You read a chapter and go through the action with the characters. Then someone who wasn't there shows up and the entire scene you just spent 5 minutes reading is gone over again - in its entirety - for the new person. This happens several times in the book. There is even at least one instance where the same sequence is gone over three times! Just too boring. I also didn't connect with the main character. I think that the author wanted to make her seem endearing by having her completely inept at using any kind of electronic equipment, having no sense of direction, and being unable to run or even walk without falling down or tripping. In one stretch, the author spends page after page describing her trying to get into bed without falling out. I'm sure it was supposed to be ""cute"", but it just bored me. I couldn't click the forward arrow on my Kindle fast enough. I didn't like the book very much and I cannot recommend it.",0
"This is a very good Book, it keeps you interested all the way thru the book. the Character Hawke is sure one guy not to mess with. If you enjoy reading Westerns, then I'm sure you will glad that you bought this Book.",1
"Must be an east coast thing or a jewish thing...""No ID"" there.  I read the whole thing & expected more but the story hardly went anywhere.  Even for a buck...it waisted my time.Didn`t like Jill(one of the main characters) too narcistic to want to warm up to.One positive,  his writing style seems promising & easy to follow.  Didn`t need a dict handy to decifer fancy words. The whole Woodstock thing just did not hit very close. It was just used as a remote backdrop to the aimless storyline.",0
"The positive:  The book is very well written with tight scenes and well-developed characters.The negative:  I could not bring myself to like Briony.  Her constant daydreams about the perfect Master quickly became irritating as well as highlighting her shallow materialism.  The many insertions of e-mails from an online BDSM dating website were disturbing and really didn't add to the story of Chris and Briony.  In fact, the majority of the story wasn't about the relationship between Chris and Briony, but was about Briony's neurotic need to find the ""One"" and the destructive behavior in which she indulges.I completely agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned that the first-hand style of writing hampered this story.  I found it difficult to understand why Chris would want Briony when I had no clue to his thoughts.",0
"Belle Taylor has her life carefully mapped out.  She's been making goal oriented lists her entire life and never once has she failed to reach each milestone and feel a sense of accomplishment as she marks it off the `TO DO LIST.'  For the first time ever her goal of a plush corner office and her name on the letterhead of the law firm where she's been working has her considering altering her plans.  She's been working eighty hour weeks for the past year and Belle's just beginning to realize that the perks of her desired position may not be worth the sacrifices she's made.Rafe Bettencourt, Belle's brother Brian's best friend, has been a longstanding friend of the family and the object of Belle's fantasies since she was twelve years old.  It wasn't until five years ago that he began to view her as a desirable woman - before that she was simply Brian's little sister and a whole lot of fun to torment.  Rafe's perfectly aware of Belle's anal retentive, control freak nature but that's a trait he's begun to find very alluring about her - there's nothing he'd like more than to strip her naked and make her lose control.For the first time in a year, Belle has returned home to visit with her family for the holidays.  She's thinner and paler than she had been on previous visits and everyone points out the fact that she's had no time for herself, family, or anything else that makes life worth living.  Belle's perfectly aware of that fact but she's come so far and is so close to her goal - quitting now is simply inconceivable.  Rafe proves to be a delightful distraction from her own troubles as he tempts her to be naughty with him.  What better time to start up a little romance than Christmas and seeing as she'll be visiting for a full five days, he's determined to give her a good reason to make some adjustments to her `TO DO LIST.'  Adjustments that include him, a happily ever after, and all the organizing and list making she could ever desire - as long as he can seduce her into giving up her `dreams' of success in San Francisco.  Or had she already been coming to the conclusion that there's more to life than a corner office and empty apartment all on her own?  Rafe just may provide that extra push she needs to take the leap of faith and move one of her long term goals up a few notches.Lauren Dane will have readers smiling with this delightful tale of hope and promise.  TO DO LIST captures Belle's single-minded pursuit of her dreams and her lists with humor and a little sadness.  There's no doubt that she's well on her way to acquiring her goal, but she also realizes that it isn't worth giving up her `real' life to achieve and accepting that she isn't going to get to cross that goal off her list is difficult to accept.  Rafe is willing to accept Belle exactly as she is - organized shoes and all - but he's also aware that the path she's on is a destructive and lonely one.  Rather than try to tell her what she should do he presents her with feasible options which may make her happier.  I had a great time reading TO DO LIST especially since I'm guilty of making these infamous lists myself.  I loved the family aspect of this story and the way it makes you see that there are more important things in life than reaching every goal you set for yourself - there's health, family, love, and your own happiness.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",1
"Alex wants Allie and his best friend Charlie,Allie wants Charlie and Alex. Charlie for his part loves Allie and has no idea that his best friend Alex loves him. Allie had run away six years earlier when Alex revealed his feelings for her and Charlie. Six years later after having traveled the world and learning more about herself and life; Allie returns home. Charlie is delighted because he has always loved her, Alex is delighted too because he feels the same way about her. Now Allie and Alex have to convince Charlie that the three of them belong together. I really enjoyed this book. The revelation of Alex's feelings toward Charlie was handled well as was Charlie's acceptance of his feelings regarding Alex,and his acceptance of the fact that they both loved not only Allie but each other. It sizzles!!",1
I read The Amazon's Curse and was let with a lot of questions. It was a short stories. But it was missing something?????,0
"1.75 StarsThe one thing I can truly compliment on this one is the disclaimer expressing that this does not show an accurate presentation of BDSM relationships was a good move on the part of the author and probably kept some of the criticisms for some aspects of the story down to a minimum.This story turned out to not be my particular cup of tea sadly.  I had hopes for the concept of ""the Clan"" after reading the blurb, but it was never explained in a way that made it feel anything but vague and a little flat.  The repetition throughout kept taking me out of the story itself.  I just couldn't get over the feeling that this was not a full story ... but maybe more like the erotic middle of a longer work.MadGiles",0
"Not appealing at all - an attempt to do Lucy/Vivian type hijinks. Janet Evanovich delivers on this type of mystery/humor, but unfortunately, I just found the heroine annoying, and unappealing.",0
Just what I expected I enjoyed the read.  I said what I wanted to say I do not understand why I must write so many words that aren't needed it seems like a waste of my time and the person that has to review what I wrote.,1
I really loved this book.  Being someone that's hooked on anything military from WWII forward.....this book is just one more item added to my list!  Gotta read!,1
"Why is she selling a prologue? I know the economy is bad, but really this is beyond the pale. An author of her caliber should not bring herself to this level. I really thought she had more class than that. And adding insult to injury, the errors are appalling.Buying her next book? I will have to think about this.",0
I liked this book.  Characters were thought out and well portrayed.  i would recommend this to others. She is one of my favorite writers.  This book seems just a tiny bit less than some of her other great stories.,1
"This was my first Anya Bast book and I really liked it. I have looked at some of her other reads but her books seems a little too far fetched for me but to each his own. What makes this book so different from other menage stories is that the author took the time to really develop her characters. The men got to know their woman. They did not claim her and wisk her off and screw like bunnies 24/7. They took the time to woo her, they loved her, respected her, and they honored her. I also loved the fact that it was quite ways into the book before they actually had sex. This was a great read and one I would highly recommend! I would have loved more action and intrigue but for the most part I loved it. I hope this books becomes a series. Great job Ms. Bast.",1
"The story had potential, much as the characters. But neither ever came to fruition. It was obvious that the writer couldn't even get inside the heads of his characters, so how he expected a reader to do so is beyond me. A good editor might be able to pull this from the scrap heap, because there are some good story elements worth salvaging. The grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors might have been caused by the conversion process, so I did my best to ignore them and am only mentioning them so future readers can be prepared. I will probably read the second in the series if only because I truly want to see this writer improve on the craft.",0
Enjoyed this book. The story was well developed . Characters were interesting and likeable. Looking forward to the rest of the series.,1
"This review will follow the I-Review format aka Question & Answer format.Visitor: What made you pick up Consumed by Moira McTark?MBR: I was just browsing through Amazon, wondering which title from my massive TBR pile I should read next when this little number caught my eye with its pretty cover. After reading the blurb I had a major case of excitement over the story and the next thing I knew I was reading the preview of the book available on Amazon which just whetted my appetite for more and before I knew it I had hit the ""Buy now with 1-Click"" button and the rest, as they say is history!Visitor: Tell me a little bit about the hero Brian Matthers.MBR: Brian comes from a family of 3 brothers and 2 sisters and works in accounting at Dyson & Dale. Playing baseball in high school had been the high light of his life back then. Brian is intensely sexy and just sheer dynamite when it comes to wooing a woman in bed and out of it and I would love me some Brian as my next ""no-occasion-present."" And on top of it all, Brian has got that tender quality that makes a woman go all mellow on the insides. A man who is not afraid of long-term relationships and commitment, Brian is the reason why we women read romance novels! *sigh*Visitor: Now tell me a little bit about the heroine Amber Grayson.MBR: Amber works as a programmer at Claybourn Elliot and yearns for her own happily ever after though she knows that with the high standards that she has set since high school, the man who would fulfill all her dreams and longings is a long time coming. Amber is beautiful, sexy and knows what she wants and is not afraid to say what she wants as she has gained confidence as a woman over the years though she had been pretty shy in high school.Visitor: How does Brian and Amber meet for the first time?MBR: There is no mention in the novella of how Brian and Amber meet for the first time. But rather, Brian had been Amber's high school crush, a crush that had turned into the center-point of all her wicked fantasies throughout the years. And when a chance meeting at the train station brings Amber and Brian together again, both discover that the incredible pull between them is just too much to turn away from.Visitor: What was it that drew you into the story with Consumed?MBR: Mmm.. Consumed is a pretty well rounded novella that captured my attention and held it from page 1. Reading it one sitting tells just how much the story consumed me as Brian and Amber gave into the explosive passion between them and worked through the hurdles to reach their happily ever after. What drew me in most was the incredible connection that forges between Brian and Amber and even when things head south based upon a misunderstanding, neither Brian nor Amber can turn away from the incredible way that they can make each other feel. That I would say makes for a very heady and enticing pull towards any romance.Visitor: What was it that you liked about Consumed?MBR: As I said earlier, Consumed is a story that refuses to let go once you sink yourself into what's happening. For me, I loved everything about the novella from its beautiful glossy cover to its beautiful yet short epilogue that gave me a sense of satisfaction all around when I finished reading. What I loved most about Consumed was how smoothly the story flowed through, urging me to read on and find out where Amber and Brian were going with their no holds barred sexual relationship. And of course, the creative scenes of passion are just to die-for!Visitor: What if anything would you change about Consumed?MBR: Being a story of such short length, I would say it pretty much hit all the right spots with what the story delivered.Visitor: Any memorable scenes/quotes from Consumed you would like to share?MBR: Incredibly hot was the scene on the dance floor where Brian takes Amber upon her request making all breathe whoosh out of me in one single exhale. And the variety of sensual scenes that Moira delivers, making each one a memorable one is all I can say without giving away any details.Visitor: Who would you recommend Consumed to?MBR: Consumed is an awesome read to squeeze in if you have got around an hour and half to spare. For those who love reunion romances and intense, scorching passion without being overly explicit, Consumed is a definite must-read!Rating=4.5/5Reviewed by Maldivian Book Reviewer",1
"I love all of James Somers books, this one was good as well, but I was not as wrapped in this one as his others.  Of course, its like watching friday the 13th sequil number 8.  All the bad guys keep mutatiing into something more powerful and weird and Its like when do you draw the line on this mutation stuff.  And the messing with the human d and a is getting to be an old number.  It is not awful,  but somewhere between way out there and really.  Just my opinion.  Like to see Mr Somers write more about Jesus being the hero and not some clone or messed up person getting away with murder.  When does Jesus get to be the hero, of course He is.",1
"Though this was a free download which purported to be perfect for fairy tale lovers, it turns out to be a kind of sickening representation of Rumpelstiltskin and some woman of ill repute. I just couldn't get interested, so quit reading in the middle of the second chapter. Perhaps I should have read on further, but I felt like I was wasting time on a not so happily ever after tale.",0
"I really was completely surprised at almost every point by the turns of events in this book. Some were disappointing but most were thrilling. One thing I would've liked to have seen done differently and that was who Raven ended up giving her heart to. He didn't thrill me as much as another in the book did. As a fact he was kinda boring to me. Maybe I would've liked him better if there'd been more background on how he was viewed by others who one  him before he met raven. As it was, although the author stated that he was dangerous and exciting, his actions didn't lead me to that conclusion. The only thing I got from him was that he fell in love with Raven the moment he saw her and was a lovesick puppy from then on. He says, later on in the book that he's never had feelings for any other female but I didn't quite believe it considering how quickly he admitted to feelings for raven. The elf Prince, on the other hand, would've been more believable. It was established early on that he was feared by everyone, he used females flippantly and was used to getting what he wanted until he meets raven and he's left flabbergasted. He doesn't know what to do. He's left confused. I would say that the book wished for him to be the hero/lover of this book, and it seemed as though that's the way it was goin  until drake pops in outta nowhere.",1
Great cover and I had high hopes. The story started out good but then the cussing started and didn't stop.,0
A real cute short story with interesting characters. I would love to see more with the same characters to see how their relationship develops.,0
I have always had dogs and read dog books.  Recently got a kitten - turned big-boy cat and thought I might enjoy this book.  It was extremely difficult to read.  Almost caused me to have a panic attack.  If these things really go on out there - I guess I have been living under a rock.  A colleague was going to get it for his 9 year old daughter and I said NO  Not a book for kids to read.  I am hugging my big boy cat as I write this.  I will be on the lookout for any other Sisypuss vagabond cats out there from now on.AS BOB BARKER WOULD SAY:  SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PET (and anyone else's you can afford to).,1
"I really enjoyed the first in the Zorn Warriors series, Ral's Woman, but found this second book a let down. First of all, I didn't care much for  Casey, the female lead character. Many of the decisions she made didn't make any sense to me. This sort of ruined the entire story in my opinion. I also wasn't feeling the connection between Casey and Argernon. It started out good but then went downhill from there.",0
"Only gave it one star because there is nothing lower!  Do not waste your time on this one, though it sounded like an interesting short story it was a big disappointment.  Writing is amateurish and over the top.  Got tired of seeing be careful what you wish for. I am definitely skipping checking out what else the author offers.",0
"It was a good short predictable story.  It developed the characters well enough to where you understand their personalities, but I don't think that it is worth $5 for the amount of storyline that is written.  There are still some editing issues, but not enough to make a big stink.",0
"I like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves. Laine and Devlin are mates which is only discovered after Devlin saves Laine from being beaten up and raped by his Alpha pack leader. Devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city. Devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city. Unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on Devlin's newly discovered mate, Laine. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership.",1
"Lily and the Sheriff. Just what is going on?. Hard life for a woman, certainly gets you thinking - What is the temptation?",1
"I love to read shorter stories so this was perfect.I enjoyed the storyline, about finding your soulmate and destiny and maybe not wanting too, lol.  This was a fun and sexy read.It is a great pick up and read anytime book.  I think you will like how Eden Bradley introduces you to these characters.",1
This was a fun read but far too short.  I would have liked to get more back story for all of the main characters.  It would also have been a more enjoyable read if the main characters had a chance to get to know each other.  I would read other books by this author.,1
"Surrender is the first book in Lora Leigh Bound Hearts series, it was interesting. Cole is a dominating sexual man who knows what he wants and will do anything to get it. Tess is a smart strong woman who happens to be sexually repressed. She also harbors a lot of guilt about things that she wants because of her mother. Tess goes to spend some time at her fathers' house and when she gets there she ends up being tied to a bed by Cole. Cole and Tess have a lot of sex and begin to bond. Problems with their chosen lifestyle come in to play when Tess's mom shows up and finds out what is going on. The sex in this book is hot and has some BDSM in it along with a threesome. The writing was ok, but I felt that certain points lagged and I didn't feel like either of the characters was really that emotionally attached to each other. Other than those few problems I did enjoy the book.",0
"I was born not long after the end of World War II.  Some of my earliest memories are of hiding under the table out on my Grandma's porch listening to my Dad and all of my uncles talk about their experiences during the war.  World War II, and in particular the Holocaust, has always held a fascination (for want of a better word) for me. I've read countless books on the subject, watched dozens, perhaps hundreds, of hours of movies and documentaries, and even had a chance to see & hear about some of what happened first hand both here at home and living in Germany.In general, I do not approve of fiction when it comes to the Holocaust.  Let me tell you why.  This is an event that must never be forgotten, an event that some (all too many) deny ever happened, even with many survivors and combatants on both sides still alive. So, when I hear about something like ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", first presented as a real event, then later declared to be a complete fiction by the authors themselves, I cringe.  It will not be long before all of the direct witnesses have passed.  Even my generation, the ones who heard the stories first hand, who saw the tattoos, who have walked the remnants of the battlegrounds, are getting on up there. Before too long, there will be nothing to witness except words written in a book.  Those words must be truth, not fantasy.  Otherwise, in 25 or 30 or 40 years people can simply point to a stack of made up books and say ""see - all fiction - never happened.""There are some cases, though, where a story is important to tell even if it must be told through the medium of fiction because there are no longer living witnesses - or perhaps never were.  One of those stories is the roundup,subsequent abandonment and final shipment to Auschwitz of more than 4,000 children in the Vel d'Hiv roundup in Paris, an action carried out by the French police on Petain's orders.  There were few survivors - a mere handful - and most of those were young children at the time.  Tatiana de Rosney does an excellent job of telling the story of this horrific event inSarah's Key.Until very recently even the fact that there WERE Jewish partisans was not particularly well known, at least not in popular mediums.  Leon Uris talks about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising inExodus.  Rudi Weiss joins the Jewish partisans inHolocaust.  Only in the last few years has the story of the Bielski Brothers -The Bielski Brothers: The True Story of Three Men Who Defied the Nazis, Built a Village in the Forest, and Saved 1,200 JewsandDefiance- truly documented the Jewish Resistance.  As heroic as the Bielskis were, their group was not the only Jewish resistance group. It is vitally important that a couple of decades from now, when all who were there to witness or spoke to those who witnessed are gone, that people know that everyone did not march quietly to the slaughter like so many sheep, that the Bielskis were neither alone in their resistance nor an aberration. There is room in the historical record forThe Remnant - Stories of the Jewish Resistance in WWII.Othniel Seiden's story has its foundations in a great deal of research - interviews, records of the Nuremberg proceedings, diaries left behind by those who lived these events - and he has done a remarkable job of presenting characters that are accurate & compelling composites.Some have commented negatively on his portrayal of the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Hitler's Final Solution, particularly as regards the Pope in office at the time of World War II, a role that has been the subject of great debate over the years, debate that is not yet entirely settled.  The basic facts that Seiden addresses in this regard - that the Catholic Church had a pact with Hitler and that the Vatican helped thousands of Nazis to escape Europe at the end of World War II - are grounded in known, demonstrable facts.  It is only since the papacy of Pope John Paul II, himself a Polish seminary student during World War II, that there has been some attempt to rehabilitate the reputation of Pope Pius XII regarding his actions towards the Nazis and the ""Final Solution."" Had Seiden chosen to present this rehabilitative material, information that would have been unknown to the characters at the time during which these events occurred, would be to rewrite history.  That would be a grave error.Highly recommended.  This is worth your time to read.",1
"This book does not show the music, which I expected to get.  It only has the words to the songs.",0
"It's been a while since I've read the Wizard of Oz, and decided it was about time I read it again! I totally remember when I was little reading it!!! I get different ideas and views from it now as an adult! So good my kids are going to read it!",1
"I really didn't expect to like this story so much since it is for a younger reader than myself. I wanted to read it due to the title, Off The Grid. It seemed like a strange situation for these kids to get into. Living off the grid myself, I thought the book would be more about living that way, than a bunch of underage kids on an adventure. Well, what can I say? The story got me caught up in it and I kept reading. It was a fun read and I enjoyed it very much.This is a story of a family who had recently lost their father and had to move from their home to their grandfather's ranch that their mother had inherited. They sold everything and packed up the car and headed to Promise, Oregon with just enough money to get there. Along the way things happen and they get separated from their mother and are on their own. With the fear of being picked up by the police and put in a foster home without any parents, they manage to get to Oregon on their own.The characters were believable, and once they got to their grandfather's farm, the story really took off for me. I liked the sense of humor the girl telling the story has and the fact that she played a guitar and had an addiction to candy. I loved the part where their grandfather's preps kept them fed and able to survive on their own. While they discovered things about a grandfather they did not know, they also discovered responsibility, and caring for each other.",1
"Even though I thought the storyline sounded interesting, I couldn't get past the first chapter because of the excessive use of predictable dialogue.",0
"A good story.  Attraction was instant to both Hannah and Michael.  Problems with their class rank kept  the story swinging back and forth,but love wins out after all.",1
"I was very pleased that Mr. Attebery made me work a little to get to know the characters.  He didn't just hand you a set of characteristics and then expect you to just follow the action.  He ensured that his characters had solid personalities and that the evolved throughout the book.  A well crafted story with a tragic hero.  You just don't see too many like this anymore.I certainly prefer this type of story because it develops along the classic format of story telling.  This book was not written with a screen play in mind.  It was written with a desire to tell story and thoroughly engage the reader.Very enjoyable and satisfying, not like the junk food, slap-dash novels you see so much of these days.",1
This book was short but sweet I like all of  Leanne banks books. I'm trying to read all of her billionaire series,1
"I understand the point of view this story was told in, I really do. But goodness, it could have been told better. I didn't expect much with so little pages, but I guess I expected more than what was given to me.This is the story of a woman recalling her life with her enormous breasts from her days as a slutty teen to when she got them removed because of cancer. It was terrible. Not only was the descriptions awful but the story itself was just terrible. No emotional content. No real consistency. No steadiness. Nothing.I totally understand why it's free, but gosh, Amazon should be paying its customers to read this crap. I literally read the first few pages, stopped, scrolled through, and wanted to burn this book.But hey... it's free so what more can be expected?",0
"This book is a fast read, beach type book. The plot revolves around mistaken identities and misperceptions and is completely character driven. The characters are interesting, if not too complicated, and the writing is good.When Diona Brown's younger sister, Daryle, takes off for Greece to marry a man she met on vacation, Diona goes after her to stop the wedding. Nikias, the older brother of Daryle's boyfriend, Alexis, is dead set against his little brother marrying a ""gold digger"", and also plans to put a stop to the wedding. While the young lovers hide under an alias, Diona checks into a hotel under her own name, and Nikias arranges for her to be ""invited"" to stay at his island home. Diona thinks the invitation is from her sister's boyfriend and accepts the invitation so she can talk them out of the marriage. When she arrives on the island, she's met by older brother Nikias who is convinced that Diona is the woman his brother plans to marry, and he informs her that he plans to keep her prisoner on the island until her flight home. Nikias is sure he has the right woman and no amount of arguing or reasoning on Diona's  part will convince him otherwise.Nikias is disturbed by how much he is drawn to his  brother's supposed girlfriend. He's rich, handsome and a bit of a playboy, but he's never been attracted to a woman like he is to her.  As he and Diona spend time together, he starts to wonder if maybe she's telling the truth, but he won't let himself doubt that he's right. As the mistaken identities get worked out, the broken trust remains an issue, both for Diona and Nikias and Nikias and his brother, Alexis. Until that can be mended and the breaches healed, those relationships have no chance. Working out their trust issues and getting past the perceived deceptions will take a lot of faith and love, something that they don't have much experience with.Heat factor hot.",0
"I chose this rating as I am not sure where she is going with this.  She is terrified of two children at school, but has no fear of confronting dragons, unicorns and other mythical creatures.  I am not sure which age group she is targetting either.  I would not bother to read any future books in this series",0
"I didn't enjoy this one. If I can be honest, I don't enjoy the writing style as much as book 1. I like the narrator's voice, but considering this book was written in a four person POV, the narrator didn't even bother trying to differentiate the voices. I ended up rewinding a few times to see who was talking since it featured Zach & Angelo and Matt & Jared. My enjoyment of this series really plummeted with this book.This book started with Zach giving Angelo a free pass to be with another man, with the agreement that Angelo come home to him afterwards. Considering how hard they fought to be together 4 months ago, I was surprised that Angelo would quickly jump at the opportunities.The main problem that I had was that Angelo throws a conniption fit if someone looks sideways at Zach. It just seems hypocritical, and I was unsure of Zach's true motivations for allowing the free pass. If I really got why, I might have been able to accept it more.I completely with Jonathan's assessment that it would appear that they had an open relationship, but it only works one way. I mean, Angelo is getting a handjob on a public dancefloor in front of Zach, but Angelo attacks Jonathan for kissing Zach. Can you say hypocrite?I don't think Jonathan owed Angelo an apology, maybe an explanation but Angelo didn't even have the decency to offer  Jonathan an apology and explanation back. Angelo was just a taker and Zach a doormat in this book, and I didn't like it at all.Jared and Matt have been together for a little over a year, but Matt talked about how going all the way felt wrong. I am confused. In the prior books it seemed like they couldn't get enough, but Matt explains they do &#34;other stuff&#34;. I want to know if Matt is really gay because his feeling of guilt or that it doesn't &#34;feel right&#34; should concern Jared.I just don't get these relationships. I know everyone has what works for them, but right now, neither couple's interactions are working for me.  I will try one more book in this series before I give it up.",0
"This story was just honestly silly to me.I went into this story with such huge and high hopes. I mean it is not really that often you get a really great Dragon shifter story, an erotica one at that. Well, this was yet again not one of those good ones. In the vain attempt to not make this ranty, because I honestly have no reason to rant, I got it for free so it would just perpetuate the cycle of silly to rant about this short story. Which, to be honest, I have read so many great ones recently I was bound to come across one I didn't really like that much. So in that respect I'm going to say what I liked and what I didn't like and be as respectful as I can to the author.What I liked-I like Rajah. He was a great Alpha male and he really fit into the environment and the world that was created. It was supposed to be other worldly with an old world flare. With the way he talked and his attitude he fit. The concept was honestly a great idea. If you were to run with the general idea and mould it in the proper fashion it had amazing potential. The whole idea that there are Dragon shifters and they will snatch up you're pretty virgin butt if they sniff you out is just hot. The sex was honestly rowdy and downright dirty, she didn't hold back and I liked that. The words were raunchy and I was like ""MEOW!"" I wanted to blow my own flames.What I didn't like-With that being said we get down to the basics of why this short fell short. First off, the story is named after the female lead and she was migraine inducing. Larkspur is a `dolphin' shifter and a virgin, though you could have fooled me. The girl acted offended by being pawed at for a total of 3.5 seconds before she was naked spreading her legs. Yes, I get it's a short and you have a word count you are required to work with, but did she have to talk like a girl from the Valley in Southern California? Honestly, it didn't work for me. The moment Larkspur saw his `manhood' she changed. Her dialogue became unbelievable for the old world setting and she just said the daftest things. She ruined the story for me to be honest. When you use the term ""Well you do have a yummy looking c*ck."" And then have her spread her legs out, a supposed virgin that also doesn't feel any pain when said dragon man slides into her HARD mind you HARD! Make it just a little bit believable please!!!!!Needless to say I don't think I will be running out to get her other books based on this world, though I am curious if she runs the same theme with the women that are just so horribly unappealing.  I feel that this is a rant, I'm sorry that this is a rant but I was in bed reading this at 12am just going `Really! I stayed up for this!' I think I was just far too excited about it.",0
"Other reviewers were right on the money when they pointed out that this book could have benefited tremendously from quality editing, particularly if the editor had the sense to tell the author that some of his writing quirks were patently ridiculous. The main characters' first and last names are used nearly every time they are mentioned, and they call each other by first and last name almost as often. If that was intended to be cute mannerism it didn't work.Large portions of this book were completely unrealistic and disjointed, even for a book that one automatically approaches with a certain level of suspended belief. The characters should have had potential, but never lived up to it.The (very small) part about them actually finding the ark was interesting, but also completely failed to live up to its potential. It was surprisingly brief and largely ignored for the rest of the book, despite supposedly being at the center of the story. I finished the book, but won't read anything else by this author and suggest other readers not waste their time.",0
"I don't really like ghost stories, but sometimes I read them, especially if they are love stories. I definitely didn't like this one. I think it's a part of some longer series, there are mentioned some things which are never actually explained. I would need some more background. And the love story was quite boring. I don't recommend it.",0
"Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot. However, there may be more than meets the eye this time. Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details (*raises hand*). Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK, the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in ""Man of Steel.""",1
"Usually three (or more) somes aren't my style, but this was free, it was spicy, and I was curious, so I gave it a shot. I was really surprised by this one. The emotion was very well done. It ends up being an albeit very different but very sweet romance. Their love and devotion to each other was very real, their attraction palpable, and the heroine was fabulous. Her ""voice"" really leapt off the page, which made her a very real person. Was a very enjoyable read in this sense. It hooked me from the beginning and kept me reading.Only gave it four stars, though, because there really wasn't a plot and what little conflict there was was pretty flimsy. But it WAS an enjoyable read. I'd definitely look for more by this author, but I have to admit that the shortness of the book stops me. Paying three and four dollars for something this short just doesn't feel worth it to me. Not the author's fault, however. All in all, this book has a very ""fantasy"" feel to it. Enjoyable read.",1
I guess his diary was just like anybodies. It gets better with time. The Nobody does have a good sense of humor though.,1
"I consider myself a tough reviewer and so am surprised by the low reviews.  I really liked this story.  Maybe because of the price and for the length that set a certain level of expectations for others.  I do think it should have been more like a $1.99 - 2.99 based on length, but what was there I liked quite a bit.  I am really impressed by Ms. Anderson's writing; maybe 15% of the time I'm not a fan of her books, but overall, she is very consistent in delivering interesting world building and great romance.",1
"At 96 pages in, I had to give up. I couldn't do any more. Nearly 100 pages in, this read like a high schooler-written fanfic.The grammar was atrocious; the spelling creative, for example, using the little-known 's rule to make a plural when you aren't sure if it's an ""es"" or just ""s"" to make a word ending in ""o"" plural (hint: you can NEVER make a plural with an apostrophe unless it's a letter or number); and worst of all, for a ""book"" (it's really part of a single book the author has broken into multiple parts to milk more money out of readers) marketed as erotica, I'm left asking where the erotica was. Too much plot with uneven characters and choppy, insipid dialogue was broken by one very short sex scene that fell short of erotic in 100 pages. You find more sex in a standard romance novel.This self-pub was not ready for prime time, and it shows. Life is too short to spend reading books that are driving me this nuts, and as a copy editor by trade, my fingers were itching for a red pen. That's not reading; that's work.",0
"It took a bit for me to follow the animal/human flipping back and forth, but it is a nice fantesy novel",0
"I have just recently become acquainted with Joe Hill, and I am so pleased to have found him.  I am a huge fan of Stephen King, and have read everything released of his.  Joe Hill is both prolific and enchanting..love his stories and books.  I have a big collection of his that I haven't gotten to yet, but anticipate the enjoyment to come.  This story is an excellent read. Loved every minute of it.",1
"This wasn't what I expected at all. I thought it was going to be a reference for all those pithy, wonderful sayings that are part of the language that we hear people say and wonder who said them first, what they mean exactly, and the context for them. No, this book is full of quotations I've never heard anyone say and left me wondering &#34;familiar to whom?&#34; Archaic, irrelevant, meaningless nonsense. I couldn't even read it all, but glanced through every few pages and didn't find anything of interest or value.",0
"With a length that skirts the boundaries between what I would consider a short story and novella, If You Believe introduces us to Aubrey Mathison, owner of the coffee shop Bean There, Done That, and Chief of Police Price Delacroix. Aubrey is still damaged from the betrayal of her now ex-husband, and since their divorce she doesn't have relationships with men. She dates and has sex. That's been working out well for her until her life takes a bit of a turn. Suddenly the homeless man across the street is spouting predictions that come true, her coffee shop goes up in flames, and Price Delacroix meets her, wants her, and refuses to be just one of her other men.There's no doubt that the heat between them is incendiary and the sex scenes smoking hot. The story is tightly compact, but due to the length, we get a much better idea of Aubrey as a character than we do Price, who never seems to develop much beyond superficial eye candy. I've read other novellas of this length that focused more on both character's definition, and realize that my preference lies in that area. I'm not criticizing this story, don't get me wrong. I think it was comprehensive, given length-constraints, in detailing Aubrey's character enough to lend her believability, and I enjoyed seeing her interact with her friend the hairdresser and the guardian angel. In fact, had Price's character been given just a bit more definition, I would have really liked this story. As it stands, I think it's better than okay, but just lacked a bit for me to make it truly enjoyable. The sex, though, was stellar. 3.5 Stars.",1
"This was among the best 2 or 3 thrillers I read in 2010, and I read a few dozen.  Writing is tight, the pace is breathless, and the main character is complex enough that you simply must find out what happens next.  Highly recommended",1
"I just finished reading this book and I'm... Hmmm, disappointed.  Is this a young adult novel?  It reads like one.  I just couldn't believe that supposed mature, confident women would respond the way these characters did.  The storytelling is good, it wasn't too painful to read, but the reactions and story development was ... bland.  There were times when there was just too much detail and times when the details made no sense.  This story felt like it came from a writer in the infancy of their career? Ability?  Either way, I'm not bothering to buy the other books.  These kindle free books are getting so annoying with the continuations.  I think that's why most of them are so bad.  The only book that I can recall that was sensationally good and worth the investment of the 2nd book was by Olivia Cunning, Backstage Pass.  However, I will say this, at least I was able to finish this book.  I couldn't even get through 100 pages of the first Twilight book.",0
"This book it basically literary candy - nothing substantial but a quick fun read. The lead characters are enaging, as are the secondary characters (who become the focus of later books, so the author does a good job of rounding them out here to get you interested in them). Although the world she created was interesting, I found the whole ""guide"" thing kind of disturbing.I don't normally read romance novels (this was an impulse purchase b/c of the low price b/f I realized what it was about), so I'm not sure if fans of that genre would like this book. There was definitely romance and sex, but it wasn't overpowering and mostly fit with the overall story.I really like Moira Rogers, so even though I don't read this genre, I read her stuff. Her writing style is easy and flows well. She doesn't try to make her books more than they are.I've now read all three books in the series, and they get better with each book, especially the third book focusing on Dylan.",0
"Have read all the reviews for this book to date and I'm very confused to say the least.  This was also under my recommended list but under &#34;Scottish Romance&#34;.  No where on this page does it classify this book under &#34;Christian&#34; anything.  Although I have not read this story to its completion yet I have read the sneak peak preview.  I am making this review now because of the 1 star reviews about the &#34;sex&#34; and it falling under a supposed Christian classification.  I certainly understand some readers being offended by overly graphic sex or even some sex in a book and not wanting that type of material.  What I don't understand is although it may have slipped under the &#34;Christian&#34; radar in recommended books why would a person purchase this title when NOWHERE in the DESCRIPTION or ANYWHERE ELSE on the PAGE does it reference &#34;God&#34; or &#34;Christianity&#34; once? I even clicked on the author to see if her other titles were &#34;Christian&#34;, there was only one other title and it was not of the &#34;Christian&#34; genre.  There are several genres that I do not like and will not purchase (Vampires, Dark Paranormals, Created Science Fiction) but due to crossing genre lines, Historical mostly, I occasionally get titles in my recommended list that are not what I want hence &#34;RECOMMENDED&#34;. I don't normally purchase a title under 300 pages because I have found that it takes at least that many pages to develop a decent story. This is actually one of those stories, not much over 100 pages.  That is the very first thing I look for is the length of the book. I normally would have just moved on to the next recommended title when I saw that it was a short story.  With this it just seemed strange that the ratings were so far apart.  In reading the reviews I found out why.  Seems unfair to the author to give a 1 star review because a reader didn't check the material before purchasing it.  If it was classified &#34;Christian&#34; I could understand those reviews but it is not!  I am giving it 3 stars at this time because I have not purchased the entire book, just the preview.  I will update my review when complete.",0
"I just love K.A. Mitchell. This story may be short, but its great! Cade is a pierced, bad boy, a free spirit. Elliot is an uptight, do everything by the book, make no mistakes kind of guy. Until Cade brings out the naughty in him! This is a wonderful opposites attract story.",1
"I absolutely loved this short story. The whole aspect of it in general was interesting. The sex in it was great, not too much but just enough in my opinion. I wish it was a longer book, I want more :)",1
"This is the second book in a three part series ( as of yet), it can be read as a stand alone no problem. While it can be read on its own the others tell a bit more to their story  :)  short stories filled with lots of steamy lovin. Great for a free kindle book.",1
This is my least favorite book by Shara Azod.  It kinda started off slow and it took me a moment to really get into it.  I loved how much the hero cared for the heroine from the moment go.  A very solid read.,0
I found this story very dull and plodding.  Things that didn't need to be explained were explained in great detail.  Other things that required more explanation were just left hanging there.I felt as if I had to force myself to finish reading it - something that rarely happens with me.  I just wasn't engaged by the characters or by the story.,0
"This book is poorly written, poorly translated, or poorly written and translated.The wording is so awkward as to distract from the story and the dialogue is stilted.  There are way too many characters that are poorly differentiated.I understood WHAT happened, but I had no idea why.  Was this a type of magical realism or am I supposed to think that things like this actually happen?  Putting the word ""Mystery"" in the title was misleading - this isn't really a mystery.The characters didn't seem realistic - they were always either losing their temper or on the verge of losing their temper.  One character was presented as being on the verge of a nervous breakdown for five whole years.  People walking around London just happen to run into people critical to the story, as if London is a small town.  Jokes are hokey and unfortunately frequent.Skip it - even for free, putting yourself through this isn't worth it - unless you happen to have won immortality in an inexplicable game and have time to read a limitless number of books.",0
"I really wanted to give a higher rating... I really did. The truth is the writing is superb, the storyline is interesting, character development is well done, sex scenes are plentiful, and it has the dark elements I love. So, why? It's sooo long. Don't misunderstand; I read fast so I enjoy a long book but I don't enjoy books that say in three paragraphs what you can say in three sentences. To say this novel is verbose is a gross understatement. I read a lot of erotica and this is the first time I've ever read a sex scene described to death. It just went on and on and on to the point where I felt so out of the moment it was more like reading a how to manual. The entire book was like that--every scene described in exacting detail to the point of boredom. Cut the word count in half and this would've been a great book. Such a shame.",0
"""To Find and To Keep"" is not a deep, realistic plunge into gay erotica. It's more like a fairy tale--sweet, sappy, improbable and delightful and there's even a happily ever after ending. Take the Cinderella story. She and Ryan had a lot in common. They were both sad, lonely, forsaken young people. They were treated badly by those who should have supported them. Both go through trials and tribulations and are eventually restored to their rightful place with someone who loves and appreciates them for who they are. Far fetched? Maybe...but the thing is, this story has a message--Being yourself, regardless of what others think is the only way to achieve happiness. If you want to read a story that is hard core sex, this isn't the book for you. However, if you want to read an uncomplicated, uplifting, entertaining story with a positive message, it may well be something you will appreciate. Thanks Serena!",1
"I enjoyed the characters.  I read the others in the series for that reason. I could tell it was written by a man the way the characters were described. It kept me interested through out, but I have read better books.",1
"I enjoyed this book and there is sex in the story too.  Yes, it is short, and should be less than a dollar because of the length, but I was still a different story line. Since it was the first book in the series that I read, not sure if I would get more, unless you get more pages  for your money.  (ljb)",0
"This book started out very Slow with absolutely no dialogue. It took a long time to build a foundation. There were some very strong curse words that didn't show up until halfway the book. I do not read stories that have the word ""G D"" in them. The same story could have been conveyed without the strong language. I immediately guessed who the murderer was. I would not recommend this book to a friend.",0
"I wanted to love it.There are so many flaws with the book so let's address the most prominent ones:Length is an issue for me. Long winded but never really getting anywhere.YA romance with nothing to sink your teeth into. I'm not asking for naked, hot, sex scenes on each page but the tween romance has been done, is over and the t-shirt was eaten by the washing machine.Cover dishonest. Look at the cover and refer to my previous comment.1/3-1/2 of the book seemed unnecessary. There was so much fluff it made it impossible to engage and finish the book.Spelling, grammatical and punctuational errors very rarely cause me to pause and try to figure them out. I can read through and my brain will automatically put what should go there, but there were many times I had to stop, consider and think about what was correct in that sentence. It became a distraction.I thought about reading the next book in the series because I hate giving bad reviews, but in all honesty the thought of a root canal or bamboo shoots under my fingernails seems to be more appealing ideas instead.  I'm sorry. I really wanted to like it, but it just fell too short for me to enjoy 90% of it.",0
Loved it could not put it down read this book in two days. I loved it Its a must read,1
"I have come to love this  family. I have to say, Mrs. Jackson did a terrific job in showing how close and loving a successful family can be. She has also included friendship, trust, loyalty and respect in all of the relationships.  I love how this family sticks together no matter what and is always there to support one another. All of the books tie together whether you read them in order or not. By the time I finished this book set, I was convinced this would make for a very go. od movie. Better than any of the family movies that have been made recently. Even though Mrs. Jackson can get a little repetitive in some areas, it does not take away from how she has been so family oriented and creative with these love stories. She keeps you wanting to know what is currently going on with the rest of the family and each story gives you an update. I will definitely read her other family series as I am still interested to continue following.",1
This is the second book I read about this author. I stopped reading this book at chapter 2. The only thing I found interesting about this book was how the baby lost his parents. Other than that the book was boring and I found it too dry and lost interest. I liked the first book I read by this author better than this one.,0
Finally you can read the fun and interesting national newspaper in an electronic mobile format.I have loved USA Today for years and I am glad they came out with this.Recommended.,1

"...I'm a huge fan of Grace Livingston Hill, I used to read her books as kid..However,I wasn't a huge fan of this book.. I was expecting a little more romance, which unfortunately didn't turn up until the very end of the book...I also wish that she expanded more upon the family of the main character throughout the plot ..but overall, it was written very well, and I like how she interwove the christian message throughout the plot.",1
"I picked up The Ghost Shrink, The Accidental Gigolo & The Poltergeist Accountant after reading the second story in the Karmic Consultants series,The Ghost Exterminator. I enjoyed that full length novel so much that I had to start from the beginning with the novella that started it all, and while I admit I enjoyedThe Ghost Exterminatorquite a bit more, The Ghost Shrink, The Accidental Gigolo & The Poltergeist Accountant was cute and fun.Lucy Cartwright is a medium, but she's been sexually frustrated for so long that her energy is connecting the most prurient ghosts to her for help transcending, and frankly, she's getting a little fed up with short, balding, overweight accountant-type ghosts stripping down in her bedroom and bumping and grinding their way towards her bed. A call to her boss for help with the embarrassing situation ends with a suggestion that Lucy rid herself of her frustration to rid herself of the horny ghosts. To put it bluntly...and a bit crassly...she needs to get laid.Considering that the helpful, if difficult to take care of at the drop of a hat, suggestion came from her boss, it wasn't Lucy's fault that she assumed the tall, dark, and delicious-looking male who banged her...er...banged ON her door the next morning was an...employee bonus from the boss. He introduced himself as Cox, after all. Imagine her mortification, then, when she realizes that Jake Cox not only isn't a gigolo that her boss set up to help her out, he's a private investigator and the brother of said boss.Really, would becoming one of those horny ghosts be SO bad after she dies from embarrassment?Jake needs Lucy's special brand of help and Lucy needs special help, full stop. And they both want each other badly. Toss in a couple of horny, pathetic ghosts and a murder investigation and you have the fun, silly romp that is The Ghost Shrink, The Accidental Gigolo & The Poltergeist Accountant.It's a light read, and it's told with Andrews' quick-witted and carefree style that goes down so easily. As a novella, it lacks in the depth of plot and character definition areas, though enough is provided for some fun. My only real problems with it were that it was a bit too light for me, almost slapstick, and Lucy and Jake's seismic-level attraction was a bit shallow for my tastes. There just wasn't enough time in the story, which even for a novella leans more towards the shorter end, to develop a relationship between them that was based on anything but physical attraction, so that didn't quite work for me.Still, this is a novella that isn't supposed to be taken too seriously, just enjoyed for what it is. It may not have been totally to my taste, butThe Ghost Exterminatordefinitely was, and I've already downloadedThe Sexorcist, which is the third book in the series and the second full-length novel. I will say, while I enjoyed seeing Lucy and Jake's introduction, as I'd met them inThe Ghost Exterminator, ultimately either of those stories could be read as stand-alones. 3.5 Stars.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",1
"I did not like this book at all.  Poor Bradley ia misused and abused by everyone.  He has horrible memories of high school, a roommate who is a total jerk, and his attempts to enter the gay porn industry are just disasterous.  I felt really bad for him.  I would not recommend this book to anyone, and be assured that I will not buy another work by this author.",0
"I've seen a bunch of bad ratings for this FREE ebook and I must disagree.  This was a free ebook which I feel had a purpose to entice the ebook reader to download it and see what the series had to offer.I have read all of the Henry Parker books and I consider myself a fan.  Reading this FREE ebook took less than a day.  I liked it because it gave me the sense that Jason was talking to me for a brief moment about where the series now sits and where it's going.This ebook was released the month in between THE FURY and THE DARKNESS.  For anybody that watches TV, we all know about teasers.  Give the author more credit especially since he didn't charge you for something that still took him time to write and publish.Last but not least, this ebook built the suspense from THE FURY to THE DARKNESS effectively (especially the last couple pages).",1
"I started reading this book and wondered if the guy would ever get his life straight.  I felt sorry for him, I worried about him and then I was angry that he was making the same mistakes.  As I read more, I started to understand why he was repeating the cycle.  Really it was no different than someone being abused, then dating someone abusive, you do what you know.  The change that this man made, was awesome and the lives he touched.  When I got to the end of the book, I was heart broken that he did not get to do more.  Very good book.",1
"I would have preferred a little more back story on the main characters earlier in the book, but the back stories were set out later. I would have preferred a little more depth but I also understand that he is writing many more books with the same characters so I understand not fleshing everything out in the first book. I will DEFINITELY be purchasing more of this author's works but have to take it slow on disability income. Otherwise I would purchase the writers entire inventory from Amazon kindle store. Five stars all the way !!!!",1
I really only maybe liked this book. I give three stars for effort on a good storyline. It was so unbelievable. The heroine and hero were talking about their future and love for each other before either had said I love you. And the author did not brief us on their falling in love at first sight. I did finish the book just out of curiosity but I will never read it again...,0
"I've enjoyed this blog a lot on my Kindle. It has a really nice mix of stuff - how better to say, it's kind of interesting musings about all kinds of things, not just books or technology.The postings are very well written, as we'd expect from Amazon. The entries are about the right length. And they are enjoyable to read. I am addicted to Engadget, so I pretty much see tech events as they happen in almost real time. Amazon's reporting on those events is only about 24 hours behind, or just barely behind.There's a couple of strange things that just don't work so well. The formatting is odd at best. There's a lot of hyperlinks in the blog. Unfortunately on a Kindle they get underlined with a little character behing them and some spaces - so it's super strange to read with these annoying little characters. Of course you can open up the hyperlink by clicking, but it's kind of a pain.Images don't always work the best. They are OK, but sometimes there's more pictures that are important.Then there's video posted occaisonally, well that sure doens't work at all.Now the biggest complaint. If you happen to not read this blog for about 2 days, the old postings disappear. And there's no way to go reload them. So if on Thursday, I've forgetten to or not bothered to read Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday postings - most certainly there will be no Monday material. Tuesday has a shot at an article or two if the Thursday entry is small. Wednesday will be there. It's just not much fun to not be able to read old posts.Oh it does not feed to iPhone.So this blog is free. Well how can anybody really complain? I'm an almost daily reader now.Apparently this blog is somewhere on Amazon, my best efforts to search for it could not find it. The only way I could get to it was to use google with the search term amazon daily. Sad that I had to go all the way out there to find this nice blog.I think you can type in this: amazon dot com slash gp slash daily.",1
Excellent story of a possible future for Earth. What happens when non-friendly aliens find out about us?  This book concentrates on a few main characters and how they are affected and what happens to them. There is a colony on Mars where the aliens first learn we formerly insignificant Earthlings can now traverse between planets.  What happens will be shocking to people who believe any aliens of superior intelligence will be friendly.Author has done a great job.  Imaginative and interesting.  You won't get bored! Once in a while the story lines get a little tangled so you really have to pay attention to chapter headings. Will the people of Earth survive?  Will they want to?,1

"I didn't much enjoy the book, in fact ""speed-read"" the second half, just to see who dunnit.  The investigator asks himself the same questions over and over and over, things happen at molasses speed, and some of his interactions with his daughter are not realistic.  For example, after having been attacked in a campsite with an AK rifle, he sends his daughter alone on the same road as the shooter 15 minutes later.  He constantly discerns that people are lying to him but leaves, asks himself those same questions again, and ends up questioning them again and getting more lies later on.  It gets tiresome!  I just couldn't develop any passion or compassion for the guy.",0
I love fantasy and these books give you that. The characters are so easy to love or hate.If you are looking for a series of good fantasy books these are the ones.,1
"Translight is an enjoyable and well written story. The characters posses depth and the relationships make sense. It's a difficult balance to provide enough detail and complexity to engage serious readers, while not slowing down the story's momentum - I think he pulled it off here. At times I wanted more, but I finished Translight last night and will by the second book today - so clearly it's worthy of the 4 stars. Doug Farren - thanks and I look forward to reading more of your work.",1
I couldn't put the story down. It was funny and a great mind tumbler. You might figure out who did it but the why is always interesting. I can't wait to read another one.,1

"I don't usually like to read books where one history follows the other, and leaves you hanging.  The stories bring back the old characters and it is nice to meet an old character.  Each book stands on its own.  Very nice.",1
"I read this entertaining entry straight through and it was definitely worth the time.....but then I did feel a little ""dumped"" at the end.  As another reviewer noted, there was a lot of unnecessary meandering and too much time spent developing characters unimportant to the story.  The main characters, however, were very well drawn and fully realized.....I would like to see them in a follow-up.  In short, I would recommend this book but be prepared to be a little irritated by some wasted time with a couple of characters and to maybe wonder just exactly why the author then seemed to slam bam the ending.",0
After reading this book I was anxious to read other books he had written.  I was not disappointed and looked for another.,1

"Being married to a Brit I'm fairly used to the slang and what we American's call poor grammar, but this book took the cake. There were so many grammatical errors, misused words, misspelled words, and British slang being used by LA detectives, it took the readability right out of it. I might recommend this book to some of my 'illiterate' friends only because I know they'll never read it. It got 1 star because there is potential with the story-maybe a complete rewrite and relocate it to London. Police procedures-not even close. And when Patton finally takes on Caldwell, he fails miserably and his backup, while only mildly wounded, doesn't even get a shot off or see where the suspect disappears to? Also, going back to the beginning, if they found the first 2 victim's bodies, why weren't the forensics people able to figure out at that point what Sarah's clues meant? I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that I won't be reading any more by this author unless he learns to proof, edit, and research his material beforehand. Sorry Simon, but this is the type of work that gives self-publishing a bad reputation, and I don't say that lightly.",0
The erotic sex scene was the only part of the story that captures a readers interest in completing this book. I expected more from this author.,0
"This book really did remind me of a Stephen King type of story.  Others before me have reviewed the plot, so I won't repeat, but I do want to say how much I enjoyed this book.  As others have mentioned, it could use some editing.  And regardless of the fact that the book used ""irregardless"" I am STILL recommending that you read the book!  The use of that non-word is my very own pet-peeve, and believe me when I tell you that I never thought I'd see the day that I'd recommend any book in which it is used!This is an alien invasion meets government mishandling in a small country town setting.  It is a fast-paced story that is hard to put down once you've begun.  The main characters are true to life, the country setting is perfect, and the occurrences are out-of-this-world!  If you enjoy Stephen King's books, then I think you will enjoy this book.  If you love to read about the struggle between good and evil, this book is for you!",1
"I love the idea of a near marriage breakup and meeting again after some years. I was looking forward for sparks to fly. Wow, what I got instead is some kind of sick Hero, the man acts like really disfunctunal. He is not someone a woman would want to have a relationship with. OMG, I hate to give bad reviews, but this author is totally not ready for the big time. I feel like I am reading an effort from my ten-year old. Sorry, I just cannot even like this, its a really weird, disconnected book.",0
"When this writer learns the difference between:there, their, and they're;your and you're;were and we're;...and a few others from every standard grammar book, I might not find this book actually PAINFUL to read.

"I read this because the author claims story is like some my favorite authors(Lara Adrian, J R Ward, Sherrilyn Kenyon, Gena Showalter) BULL!I started out liking this book then it turned out to be one disaster after another. Starting with being named Prophesy, because she is the daughter of the prophesy, (true imagination there) falling in love with the vampire that kidnaps her, Valentine, having to deal with 1000 year old vampire librarian, frozen witches, all the way to destroying half the vampire army that was coming to assisted her with werewolf allies and flooding the one she loves. Oh not to mention its actually a cliff hanger.The star rating wend down the further I read. the rating went further down when read the reviews on her next books. In the next books she falls for the new head of a bloodline finds her first loverbla bla bla but book four it seems the vampire that would kill anyone who touches her is ok with sharing?DELETE",0
"I was very pleasantly surprised by this book.  I picked it up because it was a free read, expecting it to be at most OK, but I really enjoyed the story.  The main character is a down and out heroin addicted prostitute who falls in love with the vampire that turns her.  For me, the ending was not even close to what I thought it would be.  In some ways a bit of a let down because it didn't really end with all the good guys living happily ever after BUUUT the fact that it didn't really follow the whole "" and the two vampire lovers lived happily ever after"" format was a really nice change.As another poster mentioned, yes it could use a good editor and there's probably a few story line items in the book that could use some work.  It's not a real thought provoking work of art, but overall it was a really nice, easy read.  The author should have a second follow-up book either already out or in the works and I'll definitely look into that.",1
"Too many characters and not enough information to keep them being interesting, but maybe it's just me. Sorry I just wouldn't recommend it.",0
"I love young adult fiction and have read authors such as Lloyd Alexander, Susan Cooper, and Andre Norton and hundreds of others (when the books were new, not reprinted). I can even quote a poem from &#34;The Riddlemaster of Hed,&#34; and if that book isn't ponderous (and I loved it), I don't know what is. I was excited about this new book!WHAT IS THE THOUGHT PROCESS FOR ANYBODY ANYWHERE IN THIS BOOK? We never get a complete account. It's narrative with random thought reports!It's an agonizing mix of minutiae followed by huge gaps or generalizations that ultimately &#34;did me in.&#34; I felt like I was reading one of those adventure books (If the ship sinks, go to page 92...) with wads of pages missing!I was prepared to enjoy this well-meaning story but I was only getting HALF of what Mira was experiencing. She has a party and gives someone the chance to say Happy Birthday and he doesn't. Aaaaaannnnd nothing! Was she disappointed? I thought she would be, but we don't know what she thought. She ushers kids into the super cool-ly decorated room and...spouts a paragraph of simplified solar system info. No responses from the other kids about the speech, none of her thoughts, nothing. (She makes little speeches like this throughout the book and they just hang there.) The kids make paper spaceships (airplanes) which aren't quite finished an hour later when a kid comes late. She asks him if it's okay for everybody to fly them. He says yes. Why is she asking him? Why is he giving permission? What are they thinking?When Mira participates in an event we note that she has an idea or does something, but not how she feels. We're told she's afraid of someone but not why or how it affects her behavior. Traumatic things happen but they are never thought of again. Mira's parents move around and talk like a Stepford family. And there's a guy that is all-wise but snarky and mean-spirited that lives under ground and men go to ask for his help and advice...yup, they do...huh...?Maybe I just totally missed the boat on this one, but I honestly gave it several tries. I even theorized that my mood may be an issue so I read a few books and went back to this one, but I literally could not bear to go beyond 67% of this free Kindle book and it's upsetting. I don't like to write negative things about a person's hopes and dreams as a writer/author, but maybe this review will help the author and/or a prospective reader.",0
"I read ""Serial"" before I read ""Truck Stop"", as I suspect most people did since Serial was a free Kindle book. I sort of saw Serial coming as the second installment as I feverishly read Truck Stop. As I read Truck Stop I was locked onto my Kindle like Candi with an I was locked in stocks in the semi. What a terrific work of suspense blended with horror and cheese curds. Possibly the most attractive feature of Kilborne's prose is that its pictures are painted perfectly with just the right words. They are uniquely his and not a poor man's Stephen King like so many other horror writers I could name.Instead of rehashing the whole story from beginning to end and labelling it a review, I'll say this: I greatly enjoyed the characters, the suspense and the story. Kilborne carefully plotted and planned for this. This is a terrific story and I can't wait for the third installment.",1
"Hummm...Fraternal Polyandry- The practice of more than one brother being married to one woman.  Yes it is real and does happen in some countries. I had heard about this in a Social Science class in college, but have never seen it as a theme in a love story. I guess if you like the idea, then go for it. I had always thought of myself as open minded, but the polyandry combined with sexual activity with a really heavily pregnant woman took me out of my comfort zone. I rated this one as  two stars overall because it does make you think. As far as being a love story or romantic, I would only give it one star just because it is not in my comfort zone.",0
"This novel had me stumped as I love the author, her style, vivid descriptions and handling of sex scenes which are hot and spicy.  I didn't quite know however what to make of this frighteningly clever play on history, or what we know as history.  I can't say I didn't like it because there is so much right with it and yet I didn't love it as I usually do with this author.  The whole Jesus concept with the twins and Abbie who is caught up in this by a freak of nature is enthralling, almost compelling so if you enjoy books by Heather then read it and see what you think. One thing is certain however and that is the fact that this is a clever book by a clever writer.",1

"All these books are available FREE from Project Gutenberg. They are also all included in the Andre Norton Megapack, which is 99, and contains 11 SFantasy + 3 Civil War books free from Project Gutenberg, plus one mystery by Norton + another writer. So, you can either get it free, or get more for the same or lower price. Unless you specifically want the mystery contained in the megapack, why pay anything?",0
"This was nothing spectacular as far as reading, but I figured it was free, so no points lost there.  I could still find myself creating the story and the budget has no end, because you can create your own special effects as you read.  Written in older English style, but still an ok read.",0
"Seriously, who comes up with these titles??  I would have passed this series up just because of the silly names, but thankfully, I didn't.  I have read the 1st two books in the series, Bite My Fire, and Biting Nixie....I enjoyed them because there was plenty of romance and steam, but there was also a good story, somewhat of a mystery, and a happy ending.  All must haves for me to enjoy a book.  The books could be stand alone, but you would miss the back story of some of the characters which carry over to the next book.  The main characters do change in each book, but are introduced in the previous book.  If you like vampire stories, give this series a shot.  This is a book for adults only, not recommended for teens.  Sex scenes are explicit, and there is also quite a bit of language, though it did not detract from the story for me.",1

Really liked this book from the standpoint of the inner workings of the machines. Didnt really care for the last part of the book but the history more than made up for it.,1
"I'm a huge fan of Heather Graham..... I love her historical romances as well as her modern mysteries.  I was extremely disappointed in Ghost Memories and felt it unworthy of her usual fare.  Not only was I disappointed in the price for such a very short novella -- a short story, really --- but she needs to fire her editor.  I would think a literary editor would know the difference between 'it's' and 'its' as well as 'there' and 'their'.",0
"Reading the description of this book, I felt it had great promise, but unfortunately it fell flat. There was so much that could have been done better, so much more I would have loved to have known about the unique situation the heroine found herself in. The cheesy, campy language of the heros made this story anything but erotic romance. Way too many ""yehaws"" and ""wooweees"" made the book more ridiculous than anything else. I honestly can't recommend this book to anyone. The only reason it got 2 stars from me was because there were very few typos and editorial mistakes than in other books I've read.",0
A good old fashioned style of who done it. The character development is reminiscent of a classic Agatha Christy NOVEL.,1
"This book was bad on every level.The plot was pretty much nonexistent. There was a small thread of ""escape Bedlam"" that was just unbelievable and after pages and pages of nothing it was accomplished in a spur of the moment afterthought way.  From what I could gather the plot line consisted of absurd sex scenes (really? hours after meeting a filthy, epileptic crazy man she is ""tiddling"" on the floor of an insane asylum with him? really?) interspersed with, well, not much more.The hero was a sniveling, blushing ""genius"" with no real depth.  If he blushed or ""brushed away a tear"" again I might have had to break my kindle.  The heroine was a self-centered little sleaze.  Her first concern was always the crazy man she had just met, not her totally incoherent sister or anyone else who had been there for her through all of her troubles.The editing started out okay, for a cheap kindle book, but it was almost like by the end even the editor/proofreader was just skimming as the spelling and punctuation errors increased dramatically.The dialogue was unbelievable and almost painful to read.  The H & h's soliloquies of ""love and devotion"" were nauseating in the way they went on and on and on page after page all the way through.  We get it, they love each other like no one has ever loved before and will be there for each other forever and would give up their lives for the other.  There were times when a character would use a phrase or word that was just not true to the time but in the whole scheme of how bad this book was this was minor.I am still not sure what the heck happened in the ending.  I know there were tears and ""happily ever after"" with the promise of more to come---not for this reader though!--after a silly chase scene where it all ""came together"" and all made sense to everyone---not!The supporting characters were as inane and uninspiring as the mains---none were developed in a way that made them feel like real contributing parts of the story.There is so much more I could comment on that made this book bad, but I have already wasted too much time I will never get back on it.",0
"Only In My Dreams is the fifth book in Dana Marie Bell's Halle Puma series. Though this is the first book in the series that I've read, I was able to follow most of the characters and relationships without too much difficulty, with the few secondary plot situations that remained a mystery to me detracting very little from Gabe and Sarah's story.Ms. Bell does an excellent job of building sexual tension. I was enraptured by Gabe, who is clearly the dominate in his erotic dreams with Sarah. But Sarah manages to hold her own. Her submissiveness to him has its limits, even in his dreams, which surprises but doesn't disappoint him. He is disappointed, however, by her continued mistrust in him, though he is sensitive enough to recognize he is the one mostly at fault.I really enjoyed Only In My Dreams and look forward to adding many of Ms. Bell's books to my TBR pile. - Kathryn",1
"I think the writer has talent, and the premise of this story sounded promising, but I started skimming before I even reached the halfway point.  The male main character was likeable, but the female main character was not. At all.  She was abrupt and abrasive and used one bad relationship as an excuse to be rude at every turn, to a very nice person.  Time for her to grow up - her attitude ruined the whole story for me.  I won't be continuing on with this series.",0
"I bought and read this because it received such good reviews - but the writing is stilted, dialogue poor and very elementary plot.  Can I get a refund???",0
"I feel as if I am reviewing two separate and distinct books that just happened to have many of the same characters.  The first book seemed to be about a guy with no particular job or goal in life except when he needed to replenish his bank account enough to stock the fridge with more steaks and beers.  At one point he finds a teenage girl on the beach who is exceedingly drunk.  So drunk that he takes her to his home and puts her to bed twice changing her clothes and she being naked.  Then we zoom back to the present day where  he knocks up his girlfriend and the rest of the first book is all about arguing both sides of the abortion/pro-life/pro-choice issue. As we read about the issue(s) involved this guy gets shot at and delivered a package of blood and tissue representative of an aborted fetus.  At no time does he ever call the police.  He calls his drinking buddy.  The drunk teenage girl disappears and her mother comes to this guy requesting that he find her.  He has pissed off the pregnant girlfriend who tosses him out on his ear, and the missing teen is killed in a traffic accident,  so he decides to go undercover as a humble hayseed who travels to where the girl was killed to get the real story. Things that make you go hmmmmmmm.Now we are at book two where humble hayseed gets himself hired as a handyman at a convent where something shady is going on.  The convent just happens to take care of pregnant teens and a mysterious black limo appears at night and pregnant teens give birth but their babies seem to disappear.  I'm sure you can figure out the rest.The book(s) isn't awful, but the author appears to have written two different books -- one that needed a beginning and one that needed an ending so he stuck them together and voila.And although I have no problem with stretching the believability scale when reading fiction, I gotta tell ya I don't believe a man is going to pick a drunk out of her gourd teenage girl and have her naked twice in his bed but nothing happens.  No man is that low on testosterone or that saintly.  What guy would be stupid enough to set himself up for a rape accusation.  Then he gets shot at and does nothing but spackle the holes in the wall?If you have time to kill and $2.99 you can't decide how else to spend go for it. After all, you won't always get two books for the price of one.",0
"I read the blurb and the book sounded like my kind of book. The reviews were great for the book. So how could I barely make it through the first part where he is convicted before I was ready to give it up. First off, no 13 yr old talks or yells when angry the way the brother did when he is plotting his eventual revenge. But hey,  maybe the author has never had a 13 yr old boy around. So I kept on. But when i got to accept for, instead of except,  etc I was done. I am not perfect with grammar,  etc but I would think someone, anyone,  would have caught these errors before publishing. Apparently not.So honestly I only got to about Chapter 3 and was done. Maybe the author totally redeemed herself later  but the writing style also did not sit well with me. Just my opinion. Maybe you will love it as others have.",0
"**Possible Spoilers** If I had to review this book in one word it would be 'ridiculous'.  I had high hopes the first few pages as the initial crime unfolded.  I went into it willing to suspend belief about a model using that profession as a cover for her real job as a CIA agent.  When I read Jaclyn's back story about her parents and her near blindness I thought, ""Hmmm...this is intriguing.""Before too long though it became apparent that this book was going to fail due to cartoonish bag guys, silly superhero type gadgetry, and a plot whose holes you could fly a plane through.What could have been an interesting thriller was anything but.  The villain of the piece was presented immediately.  A mystery surrounding who murdered the 46 people with poisoned bottled water would have been engrossing.  Instead, super baddie, (and comically sociopathic) Grant Chillings is dumped into the reader's lap.I kept waiting for a clever explanation for his horrible deeds and how, exactly, he planned to gain the monopoly on the bottled beverage industry but it never materialized.  His end game was that he was going to add poison to his competitor's products and the local water supply, thereby forcing people to drink his bottled water or nothing at all.  He wasn't going to get caught or prosecuted for his crimes because he was justified in commiting them and the government wouldn't dare touch him.  I'm no expert, but I believe that narcissists feel justified in their actions, but they aren't patently stupid.When he murdered the entire Board of Directors of his company I was thinking, ""You don't think somebody might notice you did that?""Then we come to our heroine.  Again, this could have been a very interesting character, but failed miserably.  We are asked to believe that the government could only spare one inexperienced CIA agent and a 'watchdog' for her after 46 people die from poisoning and later 9 children are hospitalized in another attempt.  That's how the government would react to terrorism?When Agent 'Snapshot's' partner is eventually killed she is told by the director of the CIA that she'll have to 'go it alone' since they can't spare anybody else to help out with the investigation.  Riiiigggghhhht.The rest of this tale consists of Jaclyn running around in a skin tight black jumpsuit that is equipped with special spy toys, using her custom made spy Porche to wage war on Grant Chilling's laughable 'army' (in one of Boston's main government buildings, no less), and the female President of the United States using Boston's Duck Boats to storm the villain's lair.  If it sounds stupid that's because it is...painfully so.Also, the author's insistence on describing Jaclyn's profuse sweating as she runs around Boston in her spy suit and trenchcoat became sickening.One surprise bright side to this book was the unintentional comedic factor.  I found myself chuckling at several of the more absurd parts such as Jaclyn's mercurial response to different situations, which I can't imagine any self respecting CIA agent indulging in.  Also, the idea of government sanctioned destruction of city property (including missiles launched from Jaclyn's car) had me laughing and shaking my head.Most amusing were the spy toys Jaclyn had at her disposal.  The unfortunate part is that none of them really helped her.  With the exception of her body armor and the security system evading app for her iPad, the bad guys still kept getting the jump on her.For a woman who was trained to use all her senses in deference of her very poor eyesight and who was required to take out several Navy SEALS as a part of that training; she was amazingly inept at defending herself.I considered giving this book 2 stars because it had potential, but decided that it merited only one because of its blatant waste of a good story line.",0
This is the book that got me hooked on Bob Moats and his character Jim Richards. In it Jim gets together with a woman from his high school days and their relationship continues threw the series. But be aware once you read one of the series you'll be hooked and want all of them,1

"Andrew Buchanan was a man that had everything.  He was the proud owner and head chef of the Blue Fish Grill.  More importantly, he had the love of his life Sidney McCall, and they were about to celebrate their first anniversary.  Drew thought the perfect gift would be to indulge one of her deepest fantasies of a m&eacute;nage with his best friend Brody Nash.  He wanted nothing more than to give Sid everything she ever wanted, and keep her happy.  While he loves her with his entire being, she has never reciprocated his declarations of love, and that left him dreading for the other shoe to drop.  He was afraid that maybe she didn't have as deep of feelings as he did.Brody Nash was the true definition of a free spirit.  He was an immensely talented desert chef, but couldn't keep his feet planted in one spot for any length of time instead choosing to sail off at any given moment.  He loved women, but never kept any of them living up to his bad boy reputation.  He had no real relationships except the one with his best friend Drew.  They had a special bond usually reserved for close brothers, and that was exactly how he thought of Drew.  When he asked Brody to be the third for a special anniversary celebration with Sid, he couldn't believe his ears.  Surely, his best friend was not suggesting that they share the women that had possession of his soul?  When Brody finally agreed, no one was prepared for the ramifications to them all caused by their combined actions.This was a moderately entertaining read, but not a keeper.  The characters are not fresh, and the story falls flat.  Drew had no business initiating a m&eacute;nage into a relationship he was so unsure of.  It screamed of desperation on his part, and he deserved everything that happened to him.",0
As with all of Susan Mallery books you laugh and cry along with the characters.  This bundle of books is no exception.  I don't have any sisters but I can imagine it  would-be like the sisters in these books.  They were entertaining and I could not wait to read each one of them.  Really like buying them as a bundle cause you do not have to wait for the next one to come out.  Recommend these books to everyone.,1
"This story revolves around two high school friends, who were more than friends, who get together after a 10 year absence to arrange a high school reunion. This story was quite short and the sex scenes were very ho-hum.  I wish the author would have had more build up and developed the characters more. The sex was also very vanilla in terms of lesbian sex and it didn't turn me on. This story was totally forgettable.",0
Sorry! I can't get into this stuff. It's just not my idea of a good read. And not being a foot fetish doesn't help!,0
"A good story really, but yes, the editing, or lack thereof, detracted from it. i enjoyed the chemistry between the characters. Especially after they met up again after the wedding. And I did find it very annoying that he refused to believe her right up until the end. Surely he could tell they weren't gold diggers long before then?! All in all, a good story.",0
It took them long enough to realize they were perfect match. Which I guess if your balance came not from the traditional two but three you would question that.,1
"Reviewed by FRANCESCA & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogFavorite Author, Lorelei James. CheckHot menage story. CheckSecond chance at love romance. CheckWhat more can I ask for?  Really?  I got this short story because, quite frankly, I forgot that Lorelei James was in a very hot menage anthology that I wanted to read.  Then I started hearing about her upcoming October 2 title BALLROOM BLITZ, which is a character from this story, and I just had to catch up.I think this just proves that Lorelei James can write an awesome romance, se xy as hell and pant y-melting ero tic....without cowboys.  *gasp*  Yes, you read that right.  No cowboys in sight in this wicked garden.Eden, the teenager, wanted to loose her vir ginity to Billy.  She loved him then.  But he didn't think he deserved such a gift or such love and he ran.  They both went on with their lives and now Billy comes back into town on business and runs right into Eden, business and personal.What they couldn't have then, they have now.  Their chemistry was sizzling, but their love for each other was as well.  I could tell they were meant to be together and complemented each other perfectly.  And just when you think there's nothing else that could make this any better, Jon White Feather comes along.He's a Native American rocker, a celebrity, and Eden's booty call.  That all makes for some hot, threesome  moments.For a short story, I think the characters are well developed enough that you can still believe their love for each other.  Whether it's Billy and Eden or Eden and Jon.  It all made sense and connected.  And I can't help but to be more than ready to read Jon's story.",1
was shorter than it should have been. I liked the little I got of the characters personalities. Needed more writing.,0
This is a little short but still delivered a great read.  Atlas and Nike are both likeable and their escapes from captivity are great.,1
While I enjoyed the series I don't see that this added any significant value.  If a reader is following the series then we already know that Zane is more than likely going to pay for his choices.  Glad it was free.  If not I don't think I would have been too happy considering it's not all that insightful as to the story of Zane.,0
"Lora Leigh is a master of kink of any kind.Lora Leigh's books are an erotic thunderstorm. Daring, exiting and fun, filled with want, need and love. If you like it hot you will love this author in general and this book in particular...And what I really like about Lora Leigh is that she presents characters who really love each other, there the sexual encounter is full of feelings, hard, but tender.Tess's mother has gotten a divorce because of the kink of her husband. So when the brother of his new wife waits to introduce Tess to the same kink it goes against her education.After years of waiting Cole has decided to take what he wants from Tess... all of her. Submitted, naked, taken!It is a nice installment to the Bound hearts series who will get better and better.Enjoy the read MBTM",0
"This book is short, a cute story with a predictable ending but still enjoyable.  For American readers, the titles of all the medical personnel in England can be a bit confusing, but not enough to spoil the story line.

"Four years ago Alessandro Marciano and Scarlett shared a passionate affair.  She discovers that she is pregnant and thinking everything will be okay she tells her lover, only to be tossed out in the middle of the night on her own!  He never even made sure she was okay.  He didn't care about her well-being Alessandro only cared that she betrayed him with another man!!  Because there was no way that he could have gotten her pregnant.  Now he has returned to her life and he blackmails her into decorating his hotel.I kind of like The Marciano Love-Child. I wasn't sure if I would like it because of the way Alessandro had treated Scarlett, but his reasons were explained well.  There were a few problems that I did have with the story but I felt that he was redeemable.  I didn't like the way he blackmailed her in to marrying him when he had denied the child was his for 4 years and even told her again that he didn't want the child - mind you the child was in the other room sleeping when he said this. Then of course he tells her no more children as though her desires don't matter.  Why couldn't he have compromised as there are other ways to have kids?  If Alessandro was so sure he couldn't reproduce then I'm guessing he didn't use protection - okay well obviously he didn't because she got pregnant - the guy got around a LOT!! So since obviously HP heroes only protect against pregnancy not diseases and since he wasn't firing blanks how many other little ones could be out there? Other than those few minor issues it was a good read.",1
"This was an absolute gem.  I was laughing throughout the entire story.  It's a quick read, but packed full of action and comedy.  I don't know if I could have laughed that hard for much longer - the length made a good match for the tightly-packed story.  Trying to string the action and laughs out to make the story longer or trying to add more in to the story just would not have created the same punch.The action and laughs start from the very beginning.  Who would have thought that a medium would counsel sexually-frustrated ghosts so that they can transcend from the earthly realm?  Not only a fresh idea in paranormal stories, but a riot of laughs at the antics Andrews provided for the characters.Looking forward to reading the full-length novels in the Karma Consultants series.",1

"Reading the reviews before purchasing this, the first in the series, I was shocked at the negative responses.  I have always enjoyed Bianca's work, so it was out of character to see such reviews.Based on my past experience with her work, combined with my love of dragons, I decided to give the series a shot.  Granted, there is a lot of sex, but this is to be expected for the genre Bianca writes in.  This is an adult romance story & not for kids, which I read as a complaint in a few of the reviews.  How anyone could think otherwise, I have no idea, as it's obvious in the description this book contains sexual situations.Also, many reviewers commented on dragon-human sex.  I did not see this at all, rather the dragons matings affect their human-bonded warriors; I saw nothing untoward about this.  The reviewers made it sound as if the dragons and humans were having sex.  Nothing could be further from the truth.If you know this is an erotic story, with frequent sexual scenes, then you should know what to expect.  As for the story, I found I enjoyed the characters.  The dragons had a surprising amount of humanity, which I enjoyed.  The warriors were strong, capable, sexy men.  There were a lot of sex scenes, no question.  I would have enjoyed the story a lot more if there was more to the story than sex, as not much occurred beyond their meeting and mating until the very end.Bianca has always had wonderful world and character building, with a great plot.  This story lacked the complexity of her normal writing for me, thus the three star rating.  Other than this, I found the reviews to be unfounded.The best advice I can give regarding this story is, if you have enjoyed this Author's writing, you will likely like this, more for the potential as a continuing series than for this story specifically.  If you have no experience with this Author, I would recommend not judging all of her work based off of this story.  Her work, as a whole is incredible.As an Author myself, I know we don't always hit a home run.  It's not a bad story, it's simply not her best work.  However, I am excited for the future of this series, as I see the potential exists for amazing stories to come.  As I write this review, I believe she is on the seventh book of the series.I would suggest, if it sounds interesting, or like something that may interest you, give it a try.  Do not let the negative reviews alter your opinions of the Author, her work as a whole, or this story in specific.  To do so would be an injustice to a very creative and successful Author.As for me, because I see the potential in the series, I will purchase the next book and see for myself.  I have faith in this Author's writing abilities enough to spend three dollars and change for a chance to see where she takes the series.Also, there were several remarks made of the positive reviews being made all by paid reviewers.  To clarify, as an Author we do not pay reviewers, or pay for reviews.  People who review books are provided with an ARC (advanced reader's copy) so they can read & review prior to publication date.  This is done for many reasons, some being for the benefit of the reader (so they have an opinion to read on a new book), others for the Author (so they can get first-hand feedback early on from people who do nothing but read in their genre).Making an accusation of paying for reviews is harsh, unfounded and discredits the Author, reviewer, and the entire process.  We have no need to pay for reviews, and it would be a vast waste of (what little) resources and time we have.  After all, when the book hits the market, if the reading public does not like it, no amount of positive reviews from reviewers will change this.Also, I would like to point out the fact that most Authors have no say in which reviewers their book is sent to, as this is often a decision made and completely handled by the publisher.  As an Author, I am given so many copies of my book to distribute, but these are used for promotional purposes only (like a contest).  I am not allowed to distribute these books to reviewers.  This is in my contract.  So, to this end, making a claim of paying for reviews again has no foundation.I know this explanation has nothing to do with the story itself, but I felt it necessary to clarify, based off of some (poor) reviews, and their comments.  Especially given, if your profession is not that of an Author, you would likely not know how reviewers are handled.In ending, I'm off to purchase the next in the series; I know Bianca's writing, and I am confident she will take this series in great directions.Enjoy!  =)Shelbie Knightwww.shelbieknight.com",0
I was very disappointed in the length of this book.  It was more like an outline for a book. It took me less than 30 minutes to read it.  I should have been a little suspicious when the sample was so short.  But I bought it any way because it was rated so highly by other readers.,0
"Well, this one was very nice. I expect that when anyone wins a large amount of money, you would become protective of who you meet. this story traverses 3 friends that have won the lottery and are trying to find love. very hot scenes and sweet loving! i like all three stories. I love to read series for some reason. It seems to keep the characters alive for me!",1
"I liked this short read a lot. The story moves along (besides it being short) and there's nothing happening thatisn't relative to the story.I also liked it because it was creepy without being stupid or a blood/gore splatter fest. I could not guess the endfrom the beginning which is always good in my opinion.Just an all around good creep book.. Like a story you'd tell while camping to scare the kids.The only bad thing is that it was short. The characters could have been developed a bit more if it was longer.Then again, that might have made it worse and perhaps the author knew best. I was just enjoying it enoughthat I didn't want it to end.",1
"Very well done Zombie Fiction with a neat twist. If you like post apocalyptic or zombie novels look no further this is a keeper. I read a lot of books and this one delivers a very good read. Well written and very well edited , not something you can often say about kindle books. Enjoy, Thanks for the great read Mark I look forward to reading the others.",1
"Since I bought the sequel, I guess I enjoyed it. I found myself comparing it to Juster`s Phantom Tollboth and thinking Phantom  was better. But I found that I liked the Langman characters enough to care about them, and the plot interesting enough to wonder what happens next. Tollbooth may be a masterpiece, but so far Logic is a pretty fun read.  At this point I`d give Logic a 92 on a scale where Phantom Tollbooth was 100.  That`s pretty good; I`ll read the sequel next and review it to let y`all know if  made a mistake.",1
"Cannot say..as every time try to read it, I just can't.Maybe its just not the book for me at this time. Maybe can do so at another time.",0
This was a shocker and definitely not what I expected. kept turning the pages thinking it would get better - it didn't,0
This is a cute little quick and I mean quick story. The plot or concept are 2 people writing each other and falling in love.  i must admit in the beginning the author includes the letters that they are writing each other.  For me it got a little annoying but it doesn't matter. Sean was crazy sexy and I loved Eve's personality. If you are the type that wants to feel connected to the characters on some deep level then this might not be for you as it's fast paste. The sex is a thumps up it was quick but still a thumps up.,1
"Each story could be expanded to a stand alone novel.  The characters were unique and all likeable.  Steamy romance, humor and drama---a winning trifecta!",1
I am a new Kindle user and downloaded my first issue of Reader's digest and was simply delighted with it!  I read it from cover to cover over a few days time which I have never done in the hard copy of the magazine.  I love that there are no ads and found it easy to navigate between the articles and features.  Thanks Kindle and Reader's digest!Its a few months later and I am updating that I still LOVE this magazine in Kindle format. I have seen a few people complain about not getting their back issues but I have no trouble at all with it. I had been off for a few weeks and when I returned I went to my Manage my Kindle on Amazon and there was a down arrow where I could select which issue I wanted to download so I selected both I had not read and voila! Both are on my Kindle now for me to read.  No problems at all.  Enjoy the magazine!,1
"I decided to read this book because of the description.  The premise was compelling.This book was very slow in many parts.  I felt the author suggested many previously published stories such as THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL, THE DAVINCI CODE and APOLLO 13.  I was often disturbed by the back and forth of the story going from one group of characters to another.  I also didn't like how some characters were introduced toward the end of the book with no back story.  Also some characters throughout the book were left without closure at the end.What I did like in this book was how good the author was at making me want to find out what would happen next. His suspense and action scenes were very well done. I read this book straight through even though I needed to skim many of the slow parts.  This book read like an unedited first draft and would have been a prime candidate for a rewrite.  This author shows promise but needs to tighten this plot.  It could have been great but turned out to be just shy of okay and a bit disappointing.",0
"even it was free, it was not worth it.  the hero was too arrogent.  the heroine was spineless.  all over the book she ranted about independence and love. the hero said he loved her but he was letting her wed another man.  her father made him kidnap her.  i could not get into the story.",0
"Really nice story line, interesting characters and I especially liked the way the present story is interrupted by past happenings for each of the characters involved, allowing us to glimpse fragments of their history and emotions. I liked the fairy and the bounty hunter even when I didn't much cared for them, which says a lot about how their were consistent and true to themselves. The intrigue was a little childish and didn't make much sense, but past that, the action was pretty thrilling, the author's imagination at its best in the creation of the crew of the Phoenix and the description of their habitats. The real surprise came at the ending: I never would have guessed who put the bounty out for the fairy.",1
"I loved this story.  It reminded me of when I was young, and began reading Stephen King, and could not put it down until I finished it.  That is exactly what happened here.  I began reading, and could not stop.  I will be reading everything I can get my hands on, from Frank Tuttle.",1
A good story line. I like the dragonriders theme to it. It is definatly an erotic book that has some pretty kinky stuff. I'm thinking about checking out other books in the series.,1
"Belinda ""Belle"" Campbell is a Halle Puma who was injured protecting the life of one Sheri Giordano a wolf who is the, wife of the Halle Marshall (see Cat of a different color). Belle's injury is repaired by putting pins in her legs, while the pins are there she cannot shift.Belle also has a problem with her pride the Halle pumas, because she was best friends with a puma who was outcast (see Sweet Dreams) the rest of the pride think she had something to do with an attack on the Beta's mate. Belle has proved her worth to the pride leaders but she has lost her job and most of her friends because of the feelings of others. After her injury she meets the Alpha leader of the Poconos Wolf Pack, when he came down to help with the attack on Sheri. Rick Lowell the Wolf pack alpha wants to take her back to the Poconos and care for her but is persauded to leave Belle in Halle to continue her therapy and care by the shifter specialist there. When she recovers more he sends several of his wolf leaders to escort her to the wolf lodge in the Poconos.Belle is challenged and taunted by Gena the acting leader of the women in the wolf pack. Gena's goal is to be the Luna of the pack and she definitely won't step down for a puma who is also crippled! Of course she's never met Belle!Although there is a serious side to his story, Belle and Rick's romance is the center of the plot and I loved it! The female shifters have got it all and they don't give up an ounce of the authority or power. You have to love them! The guys are all hot and the ladies are all that!",1
"Let me begin by saying that the only reason I completed this book was out of the shear hope that it will eventually come together.  The story was extremely choppy and just plain weird in some parts.  I found it confusing at times, so much so that I had to read pages numerous times to really grasp the concepts.  The characters are not developed well.  The potential was there but I seriously feel that the author wrote this book while ""high"" on something because it had a very strange flow.",0
"I read mixed reviews on Kiss and Kin But I love Kinsey Holley so I decided I need to make my own opinion and I'm very happy I did :)In this novella Bk. 1 of Werewolves in Love Series she introduces us to Taran and Lark (gotta love the names) who by chance happen to be cousins through marriage not blood. Both these tortured individuals happen to be in love with each other but don't know what to do about for several reasons. I love the Taboo story line :)Lark gets herself into a bad position,GHB and an attempt on her life. When Taran comes to the rescue things progress and wow do they!When you read this story you feel intensity of their feelings towards each other and the struggle they both go through.I love how Kinsey portrays Lark, she is a strong character but falls apart when unsure of herself and Taran. This made her more real to me. And Taran WOW! a patient caring Alpha in cowboy boots :) Yummy.Can't wait to find out what happens next in Yours, Mine, and Howls.Check it out!! Kinsey W. Holley writes - hot, sexy, and shifter if you like that, you'll love this. xoxo",1
This was a short novella and it had good tempo! Bargaining with the devil sometimes makes strange bedfellows (no pun intended),1
Many characters confusing to sort out.  Loved the London city setting which I have visited several times and I related to the milieu.  Found the story incredibly twisting and the characters flat with little development individually which made for the confusion among them.  Probably worth 99 cents but not more because of the lack of character depth.  It's all about the story line in this work of fiction.,0
"Just don't bother...even at free it's not worth your trouble.  It left a whole to make it desirable for me and I like Dave Freer, but seriously, this is the best short story you can come up with?",0
"As in the first book, the world building is riveting and all the stories were interesting and well written. I noticed though a few mistakes that should have been caught by a proofreader and it's a bit unexpected by this publisher. Here we go:Trust Me by Astrid AmaraBrian is now a hell cop. He is more or less a rookie. His osmotic abilities - he can draw energy from other living creatures and discharge it to heal or maim - are getting out of control, causing unwanted damage to those around him. At first it seems he doesn't want to handle them and he's unwillingness causes trouble with his boyfriend Jay, the hell cop detective who can't stop burning. The problems get worse when Brian is accused of killing a suspect in custody, since the death came through the draining of the suspect's energy.In the previous book Brian was a sunny, naive character, but this time he shows a darker side that I think doesn't depend solely on his uncontrollable abilities. The whole story takes a darker turn, because the mystery under investigation is about a terrible act that makes you feel sorry for the criminals.I liked reading about Jay's feelings toward his family, how he feels isolated because he can't be included either to comfort or be comforted by them. It was also interesting to read how torn he felt for having to be separated from Brian and making him suffer because he risked of being hurt by him. They fear they won't manage to patch up their problems, especially because their abilities keep them apart from anyone else and without each other they face isolation and loneliness.In this story the world building is at its best.Dark Waters by Nicole KimberlingThis time this is my favorite couple, the half-demon professor Michael and hell cop Argent. I loved reading how they tried to reconcile their differences or how they decided to avoid or embark on arguments.Invited by one of his students, Michael goes to a sort of trailer park to research a faun ceremony, and Argent goes with him on vacation. There's a feud going on between the fauns and the mermaids and murder happens. In order to allow Michael to interact with the fauns more freely, Argent doesn't reveal he is a cop and he does a bit of investigation on his own, also because the ceremony seems to hide a shady and dangerous ritual.Since Michael is a demon himself and works in an organization devoted to bring peace between humans and demons, he often disagrees with the hell cops' methods. He would also like for Argent to drop his shields when they're together, to allow Michael's telepathy to know his lover better. Even if they often fight, it's clear that what they feel for each other is deep and humor often defuses the tenser arguments.It was really a pleasure to read.Such Heights by Ginn HaleThis was for me the best case of the three. James is a young human photographer and Moran is his hell cop lover. When we meet them, they're relationship seems rocky. Moran is afraid that James will get seriously hurt while working one of his cases, because his natural curiosity puts him in a lot of danger. James knows that Moran is protective because in his past he lost someone he loved, but he wants the older man to understand that they both have dangerous professions and James just wants to do his job.After one of their fights and after being given a sort of ultimatum, James reaches a suspended palace where phoenixes live in order to film a documentary, but he doesn't tell Moran. James witnesses the fall of a guest from the palace, a fall denied by the palace owner and his security guards, but the man falls to the ground and Moran is the designated detective. While James stirs all kind of trouble trying to find out what's going on, Moran reaches the palace undercover and when the estranged lovers meet, they have to investigate together one more time.There are a few misunderstandings between James and Moran, but it takes a while for them to realize that they're expressing the same concern for each other. I liked reading how they reached their compromises and how both their disagreements and their reconciliation were expressions of the deep love they feel. The age gap theme so prominent in the previous book was not explored here, even if James has the enthusiasm of a young man trying to pursue his career of choice, unheeding the perils of it, and Moran has the maturity of the older man who knows how to retreat and how to advance and what the priorities in life are.Very good collection. I recommend reading the previousHell Copfirst in order to enjoy both the world building and the different stories better.",1
Michael and Emma and Lucien and Jane. This novel contains a certain amount of intrigue. The characters are only half developed. Lucien and Jane should have been in a separate book. This with A Wager are novellas at best.,0
"I have to admit this is my first book for this author.  I've been keeping busy reading S. Hyacinth and A. Kell.  I thought the cover looked nice. ..So I figured, what the heck, I'll give it a try.  Well, it was surprisingly nice.I guess I'm a sap, but unlike some reviewer's, I enjoyed the cliche a and hackneyed phrases.After finishing the book my first thought was, darn, I can't believe this is only a 200 page story.  It just seemed it should be longer, there was so much going on.  And that's a good thing!With all the action, it just felt like 5 books crammed into one, but that definitely made it more entertaining to read though.With that said, there were a couple of things that I wanted to point out that made this story special for me that were not covered in any of the previous reviews. Despite all the violence and sex, (not complaining, those Were's deserved to die!  LOL ) that is typical for shifter stories, the overall theme was about family.Sasha was an abused, isolated omega, without any family, that's the beginning of the story.Then he meets his mate/spouse (beginnings of family).I've read enough shifter stories to make the whole psychology of how and why mates are attracted, superfluous, so I'm cool with the intro.Then he gets a pack, his old pack back actually (extended family).  That includes of course, Vadim's parents (in-laws).  Then there were two more facets of family that fell into place.  I won't include those as that would be too much of a ""spoiler.""  Let's just say, that if you liked theThe Lamb Who Cried Wolf [Mate or Meal 1] (Siren Publishing Classic ManLove), then you should enjoy this story too.Last but not least, another aspect I really appreciated about this author's writing was the humor.  I can never get enough of laughing.  What can I say?  I'd like to finish up with one of the many parts of the story that I found humorous.  It shouldn't be a spoiler, don't worry!  :)Oh, to understand this part, you have to understand that Vladim and Sasha are going through those uncontrollable mating urges that all newly formed bonded mates go through in shifter stories.  Hehe.Oh, and Vadim has captured Shasha in a wrestling match (sort of) and pinned him to the ground, while they are supposed to be on the way to a meeting with the beta's and in-laws. (hint...this happens to Sasha a lot! )  ;)""Vadim growled as Sasha wiggled the apex of his thighs against Vadim's growing co**.  Sasha scooted back a little as he sat up, his hands resting on Vadim's chest.Vadim gripped Sasha's hip to hold him in place over his co** when he spotted a flash of fabric beyond Sasha's shoulder.  He felt his face heat up with embarrassment.""""There's someone behind me, isn't there? Shasha asked softly.Vadim nodded, his eyes never leaving the people standing behind Sasha's back.""Sasha says ""Your mother?""""Vadim nodded again.""""Damn! Sasha said, crying out a moment later, his hand coming up to rub the back of his head.""""Stop swearing, Sasha, Anya (In -law) said.Yes, ma'am, he replied.""And Anya says ""Now, does anyone want to tell me what's going on here?""""Vadim and Sasha each pointed to the other, their voices synchronized, and said, HE STARTED IT!""Okay, maybe some people may think that's hokey.But if you can picture it...It's a riot!",1
"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth is one of Jules Verne's earliest and most celebrated novels. It tells the story of a manic German professor, Otto Liedenbrock, and his reluctant nephew Axel who, together with a phlegmatic Icelander named Hans, attempt to follow the trail of a 16th century explorer who discovered a way to the center of the globe.Most scientists believed then, as now, that the core of the Earth was molten. Axel believes this, but his uncle does not, leading to much debate as their journey begins. Along the way there is much said about geology, volcanic processes, and pre-historic fossils. (Some English translations abridge the scientific detail.) Their exploration of the Earth's crust becomes a trip into the distant past, as they discover not only fossils but living specimens.This is a wonderful adventure story, and the wonder begins early with the explorers' journey to Iceland where their descent is to begin. Iceland was, at that time, a remote and exotic location for Europeans. It is fascinating to see how difficult it was 150 years ago to make what is now a routine journey.Verne's science is probably shaky at best. At one point Axel says that the glyptodon, a mammal, is the ancestor of the modern tortoise, a reptile (though this might have been a deliberate error to show that the young geologist's knowledge of biology was rather shaky). But one thing we can certainly take away from the novel is the infectious, exuberant spirit of adventure and discovery which led explorers of that era to take risks most would now consider unconscionable.",1
"Yes...in spite of run-on sentences, and a few incorrect homonyms in editing.... I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Characters that reflected a throwback to Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe made it a fun, guilty pleasure of a book.As for the romance, everyone knows the hardboiled, rough around the edges detective ALWAYS gets the classy dame.Thanks for the trip down detective memory lane.",1
"Geez Loueeeeez.  W.T.F. is up with some of these f/f book covers?!?!  It's bad enough so many of my lesfic publishers put pictures of trees and hospitals on the covers and are afraid of getting too sexy... but these publishers who cater to the f/f pool of readers (mostly men, I gather) are afraid of putting butches on the cover.  Or they SERIOUSLY never look like the leads inside.  Or it looks like the cover of Penthouse.  Is there no honesty or a happy medium???  pfft.Okay.  Got that off my chest.  I like Paisley Smith but I never bothered ever reading the synopsis of this one due to the cover until I got REALLY interested in her work, lol.  Glad I did.  This is definitely one of my favorite Paisley couples.  (And no, I don't blame writers for what ends up on their covers)In this one we meet an early 20something boyish lesbian in boots and jeans....  who falls for her very mature and widowed 30something piano teacher.  Emily Granger is beautiful, wealthy, and blonde.  I love the classy way she is described and the fact that she hasn't been sexually fulfilled before.  Love an author who doesn't forget to give me a visual of her lovely legs.  Or her lovely skirt.  Or the way her hair falls about her shoulders.  I love these visuals.  Emily's femininity emanates right off the page... my favorite thing about Paisley's femmes.  They are genuinely feminine and delicate... and just passive enough to create a very delicious dynamic with a butch who knows how to take control.I can't get enough of her butch / femme couples when they are like these two.  It's what I liked about Beguiled.  And Beauty and the Butch.  Unfortunately, it's not a long story and won't take more than an hour to read at 50ish pages.  Even so, I'd of probably rated it 4 stars if the stupid drunken brother-in-law hadn't cut in on this story with the lame conflict.  The last bit of the story was... meh.  But I liked the epilogue.The sex is very hot.  I'm not sure why this butch didn't show up packing to those lustful piano lessons at LEAST once... that no-harness dildo scene just didn't cut it, Paisley.  The butch shoulda been packing!!!!. lol.  Other than that... loved the sex scenes.  Very, very sexy couple.  Loved them both.I would love to see this one as an erotic-romance novel.  It's the perfect draft for such a better story.3.5 stars",0
"I can't wait to read his next book. I love the characters. We have a place in Rancho Mirage, CA and it's fun to read about it in his books. Also, we have a friend with a cabin in Twain Harte so that was a real kick too! I would recommend all of Albert Simon's Henry Wright Mysteries.",1
"I'm always looking for good zombie horror stories, but for every one good story, there are about 10 bad ones.  This, unfortunately, falls in the latter category.  Some interesting ideas are ruined by a lot of contrived, unnatural dialogue that just doesn't sound like the way  real people speak, or the typos ruin it.  Example (grammatical errors are his, not mine):""What is wrong Max?"" Stewart asked.""Ah nothing, nada, just my workout clothes kind suck, but given the alternative, I will take 'em.""This is very pedestrian writing, and I'm not sure even another proofreader going though this would help.  You can fix grammar and typos easily, but you just can't fix bad writing.",0
I absolutely love it that they sold this story separately instead of me having to purchase a digital copy of the whole anthology book it was originally published in.It's funny to watch powerful Breed warrior Tarek try to figure out life in the real world (rather than the Labs or one of the protected compounds.  Trying to cut grass... and how much pleasure he finds in the simple things like home-baked bread...not to mention trying to figure out a stubborn human female.,1
This is a sweet read about true love.  Everyone always has a day that they want to do over. This couple gets so much more than just a do over. AJ and Cooper will continue to try until they get it right whether they want to or not. The Gods don&#8217;t give second chances so easily and when they do they make you work for it. Is their love strong enough to break the cycle or are they going to chase their dreams forever?I enjoyed Cooper and AJ&#8217;s story. The two truly love one another and make a great couple. As they work through their past mistakes the love that they have for each other shines through and they only need to grab it.  As we watch the two repeat their day we see so much happen with just a split second decision in your day so much can change. It was interesting to see how their day would unfold with each new decision and with each change their bond only grows stronger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.,1
"I had trouble reading till the end of this book, the main character seemed stupid most of the time and the decisions she made were ridicules. I would not recommend this book to anyone.",0
"Perry and his wife Angelica engage in several philosophical discourses of which they never seem to agree.  This new-to-Magnolia Springs-couple arrive with a mission and that seems to be to either prove or disprove something about human character.I've read 36% of this book in kindle format and I got to tell ya, tiresome is the first word that comes to mind after the initial few to several chapters.",0
"Since I read all the books in order, I got to know the characters. This book would stand on it's own, but it is best read in the order the series is meant to be read. At this point I'm used to everybody and everything having a weird name, but it's overwhelming and distracts me when the names start to look like the author just randomly hit letters. I need to be able to imagine saying the name of something, or when it's referenced again I won't remember what it is. That's why I didn't give the book a higher rating.",0
"I would not say I liked or disliked this story. I don't mind a real short one once in a while, but it is really difficult with romance because I really want more character development and more time to understand their relationship. I liked the hero and heroine, but I think I am going to stick to the regular length romance. They are still a short read, between 4 and 5 hours, but the characters are so much more developed. I can't complain though as it only cost 99 cents.",0
"Having read the first Rachel Myers book, Blind Malice, and then skipping to Appalachian Trail Mix,the fifth book, I decided to go back and pick up with number 2.  Blue Ridge Parkway Plunge takes place while Myers is getting settled in the mountains after moving back from Arizona.  Jackson does a great job of combining the the everyday, seemingly thousands of little things that have to be done during a relocation, and the investigation of the death of Isaac Starling's best friend. I really relate to the Myers character as a real person; she's not  perfect, just someone who likes horses, likes gardening and doesn't mind getting her hands dirty doing real work. I'm not a big fan of flashbacks (there's one really long one) but Jackson handles it beautifully so the reader does not lose sight of the current story.  My own love of doing research in graduate school makes me admire Myers' determination to leave ""no stone unturned"" to find the killer. This one may cause me to buy my own Kindle.",1
"Shifter romance. Book 2 in the Halle Puma Shifter books. Very enjoyable.  Could stand alone but helps to read the first book.  Who doesn't like reading about well put together artists with a protective streak?  Good characters, good plot and leaves you wanting to read the next in the series.  Worth the read.",1
"all the Heat books were enjoyable... but this hero was the best. love her strong fiesty heroines, too!",1
I'm not a big fan of novellas but this one was good. Of course you want more but isn't that how it usually is with a good book? I definitely recommend this novella!,1
I loved this story!! The main character Amelia is married and wants to recapture her husbands attention. She decides to take a lover. This is a very beautiful love story. It will keep you wondering what Amelia and her husband will do. I highly recommend this story for those who enjoy a romance.,1
"This Very Moment is an easy, relaxed read with strong religious overtones. It is an inspirational story with likeable characters struggling to cope with the difficult realities of grief and lost love. It speaks to the heart about hope, love, and new beginnings.This book was just luke warm, althought it does have a slight crescendo of suspense at the end. It's a story of a sweet love that unfolds into a predictable, but satisfying conclusion. I just wasn't able to stay engaged with the characters and the story, skimming through some of the chapters. My rating is 2.5 stars.",0
"After reading ""A Bid For Love"" which I gave 5 stars, I was very disappointed to read this one in the series. This was a mystery and should not have been represented as a romance. Even though I know it is fiction, I found the whole story to be absurd--two ordinary people taking on a huge international smuggling ring? No way. There is basically no romance in this book and I had to force myself to finish it. I personally cannot recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great romance. Have already purchased the final in the series, so will see how it goes.",0
"This book has a rather farfetched, but interesting premise...that a group of West Pointers going back over a hundred years are secretly controlling the world.  Could have been fun, but the author seems to have strung together a number of separately written sections, while forgetting what happened in the previous sections!  Its nuts, i.e. characters show up injured but no injury was ever described, characters jump from one location to another with no connection, and there seems to be no point to any of it.Very poor writing, even worse editing (does this author even have an editor?).  Mayer needs to clean up his writing, and get it edited.  In addition, his plot is rather thin, and if he's going to go for the outlandish, at least make it a little believable.But my biggest complaint about the book is that it isn't even exciting or particularly interesting. This is no thriller, in fact it drags along so slowly, and fails to grip the reader to such a degree it is actually quite boring and laborious to plod through.Update: After reading the book, the ending was fairly good and some action sequences just prior to the ending were't so bad. So, I'm upgrading the book from one star and making it two stars.  All of my previous comments stand, and Mayer will hopefully turn out something better next time.",0
"Plot Storyline: 5 StarsThis novel accomplished what it set out to do, bring the reader an action novel. You won't find philisophical gems of wisdom in this book and, unless you are a bit twisted already, reading this book won't be a life changing experience for you.The plot is the age-old 'revenge for the death of my daddy' story. However, Mr. Goldberg does bring a little extra to the table by the end. He even manages to set the reader up for the sequel in a very believable manner.I loved the old guy who jumped out of the refrigerator covered in chocolate body spray to get his wife in the mood. There's not a lot of humor in this book, but what little there is will make you laugh.Character Development:  4 StarsEven though it was just an action novel, I still would have liked more insight into Brett's character. When he starting hearing a 'little voice' in his head urging him on, I was a bit turned off. I guess what I was looking for was a little glimpse into his younger days that might explain a capacity for the violence he later perpetrated.Also, I would have liked more knowledge regarding how Brett knew how to fight so well. A woman even asked him how he kept in shape, and all he did was avoid the question with a joke.The other characters seemed to have their fair share of explanation and motivation. The 'bad guys' were pretty well done, too.&lt;strong>Writing Style: 3.5&lt;/strong>The writing was good through most of the novel. I did have a bit of an issue with the viewpoint changes. It's as though the author wanted to write in omniscient viewpoint, but only remembered that every now and then. A part of the story would be told from one person's viewpoint, then switch to another, from as little as one sentence to as much as the rest of the scene.Another issue was the switching to thoughts of a character using ""I"", but with nothing denoting it, such as quotes.  There were some awkward sentences here and there that caused me to have to read them more than once.The author did a very good job with dialogue. Most of his dialogue was very realistic, with one small exception that was rather humorous when I tried to play the scene out in my head.  Our intrepid hero is holding a guy's head over a spike of glass in a broken window. He is trying to make the guy talk, so he tells him, ""Talk or I'll impale you right now.""  Impale?  Who the heck uses that word, especially when not holding a sword?  This was an anomaly, though, as the other dialoque was very realistic.Editing/Formatting: 1 StarThe errors in this book overrode a lot of the enjoyment. There was at least one error every other page. Many times, there were multiple errors in one sentence.  Everything from missing punctuation, missing words, wrong words, to extraneous punctuation was represented here.  I was appalled at the condition of this book.The Kindle formatting was okay with one exception. There were line breaks in odd places.Rating: R for Language, Extreme Violence, Explicit Sexual Scenes, including Rape----------------I would like to add that the author has stated that he published the wrong version. Since my review, he has published the corrected version. He suggests that if you purchased it prior to my review date, return it to Amazon and buy it again to get the new version. Otherwise, wait a day or so to ensure that you receive the corrected version.",0
The man playing the PI is good but he complains to much about his age and how he hurts all the time. The storyline was good.,0
"#MAJOR SPOILERS IN REVIEW#I picked up the second book on the advise of another reviewer. I did not realize it was part of a series, so I bought ""A Red-Tainted Silence"" to make sure I had background on all the characters from the second book, ""Long Way Home."" Now I am dreading reading book two because I really did not enjoy this book.While the writing was solid and Ms. Gray shows promise as a romance writer the plot completely failed in its execution for me. Why? Completely unrealistic and melodramatic. I felt as if I was watching a Spanish telenova as at the end of every chapter there was a major reveal or cliffhanger which got more and more unbelievable as the long novel progressed. By the time I got to the dead deer in the protagonists' bed, this was very nearly a do not finish for me. But I held out, hoping that the book would improve -- it didn't.The characterizations of Brandon and Nick were fine, in fact, I loved that they fell in love at first sight and endured so much together, but the plot ultimately dragged the love story down. I knew who the bad guy was 15 pages in, so that big reveal at the end was not a surprise. The bad guy's motivations made no sense to me and so I was lost there.Also, for people with triggers, this is not the book for you. There are multiple rapes in it. MULTIPLE. Nick isn't abused once, but many times by many people, as is the other main character, Brandon. The rapes were the main focus of the plot and I hate it when sexual assault is used as a plot device. That did not work for me and was another unrealistic part of the book.I thought I was getting a book about two rock stars in the closet and their relationship woes. What I got was a stalker-rapist-thriller that did not work on any level. First the police procedure was not researched. When one of the main characters is kidnapped the FBI are not involved, just local police. Second, when crazy stalker sets off a bomb, the ATF are not called in to investigate. And lastly when does protective custody mean Rolling Stone reporters can come in interview and take pictures of where the persons in protective custody are hiding? Wouldn't that make it easy for the bad guys to find you? Hello.I just needed a little realism for this, just a little. What could have been a great love story between two bandmates turned into a angst-fest of rape, violence and a convoluted plot that had so many unbelievable twists and turns I gave up 35% of the way in. Not recommended.(I hope book two is better and has less drama, stalkers and rapes because hot rock stars in love is a favorite plot of mine.)",0
"I've decided to post these reviews together because, to be honest, I don't have a lot to say about The Right Path and Zia's Path. They weren't bad. I just really don't have much of an opinion at all.When I started reading The Right Path, I was confused. I felt as if I had started reading the books out of order. The story literally starts in the middle of action. I had no clue as to what was going on. There was no backstory to give me a sense of the characters. I didn't care about them at all. I knew something bad had happened at some point in the past. But What? and When? Even after reading The Right Path and Zia's Path, I still felt no real connection to the charactersEven though I've made clear that I don't think these stories were well executed, I have to say that I don't think the actual writing was bad. The scenes were well-paced, and the flow of the dialogue was good.I am not trying to be glib, not at all. I don't like being negative when I write reviews. This review was very difficult to write. But, for the stories in general, I just didn't have anything to go on.  Sorry.'",0
Not what I expected but really enjoyed this will probably get more of this series.A few hot bits that are great,1
"Another great story about the people of Omaha, Nebraska.  But, if you've read the ""preceding"" books of the Nebraska series, don't expect to read as much about the Larson's, as only a couple of them make an appearance in this story and it's brief, to say the least.  However, it was nice to have a peek of Eliza's (South Dakota series) previous life and how she came about to leave it, in this book.The story was made more believable by the fact that Neil and Sarah started off on a bad note, but became friends, before coming together in bed (after marriage).The message of ""forgiving ones past transgressions"" is clear and the comical ending was a very nice touch.***If you don't want to read anything sexual, please go to the author's website where you can learn the rating of her books, before you read them.  There is no point in giving poor reviews, because you don't want to see sexual content in a ""Christian Romance"".",1
"The story/plot is undeveloped and seemingly little or no effort was spent to make it seem plausible.  Combine that with a mechanical, lackluster sex scene and the result is a really short, unremarkable story.  I've certainly read much worse in the erotic romance category though, so if a menage with brothers or werebears is your thing maybe you'll get more out of this short story than I did.",0
"I don't have anything nice to say about this book. Mama told me if you don't have anything nice to say, just keep your mouth shut.Get this short story at your own risk. Maybe you'll like it better than I did.",0
This short story was oh so wonderful!!  I loved it!  This is another author that proves you can write a story with substance in under 50 pages.  Very well done!,1
These stories put into perspectivewhat most do not know about the war and the hatred against Jews. It disgusted me what so many people went though. Sad. It was also amazing ho may partisan groups fought back like they did. The truly had courage.,1
"Thank goodness this was a free book because if I had to pay for it I would be demanding my money back.I love the disclaimer at then end of the book stating that it was written in Canadian English (whatever that means) and average gramma skills! Yeah as if that will excuse the mistakes. It's as though the writer has not taken note of her primary school English class. I'm V's I've, me v's I, then v's than, its not a well written novel.The primary school teacher dropping F bombs in inappropriate places, sentences that sounded incomplete. Just things that normal people (not sure about Canadians, though I am sure most of them are quite normal) wouldn't say to each other. The story HAD potential that fell woefully short of expectations. I can't understand why people gave it more than 1 star, obviously they could overlook the grammatical errors, spelling mistakes and lack of character development. Personally I won't be reading anything g from this author again.NOTE TO AUTHOR: Please proof read your work thoroughly before having it published. Use a spell check and gramma check. It makes your work seem rushed and will lose you readers.",0
"Loved the sex, there is a good story not great but pretty good. SEX is amazing enjoy it and so will your partner",1
"This is a nice side story that fits into the ""Lords of the Underworld"" series.You don't need to worry about what order you read this one in really, it doesn't overlap much with the plot lines so far.Reads like a long short story, appropriately enough. Light, fun and passionate. Not a huge amount of tension or mystery, but a very sweet romance. Makes a nice addition to the series on the whole.",1
"Blanchard & Beecher'sSecret Societiesis a product of it's time.  It reviews the fear and distrust many late 19th century thinkers had for societies such as the Freemasons, Marxists, and Anarchists, as well as their contempt for non-Christian religions.  When reading this book, however, it is important to keep in mind that these are the thoughts of two individuals who even in their day, were seen as fringe writers dealing in fear and paranoia.  Beecher, for example, was the abolitionist brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wroteUncle Tom's Cabinwhile Jonathan Blanchard was an abolitionist preacher well known for his inflamatory anti-masonic rhetoric.  One of their primary purposes in publishing this work was to reinforce the superiority of American-style Protestant Christianity over Hinduism and Islam, both of which had achieved a great deal of popularity among the New England academic and economic elites.  Freemasonry, another major topic in the book, had recently been involved in an event known as the ""Paris Commune"", where a group of Marxists and Anarchists temporarily gained political control over Paris.  Both Blanchard and Beecher were concerned that this movement would endanger stability in the United States where memories of both the Civil War and Reconstruction were livid, angry scars on the psyche of the nation.Secret Societies, therefore, provides keen insight into the logic and rational behind the deep concern felt by a generation of Americans that had seen their country torn by civil war and feared the rising popularity of Marx-inspired secret societies could lead directly to a renewal of widespread violence.",1
"This story was well written with likable characters.  There was a fair amount of sex that was agreeably portrayed, although somehow not super exciting.  it seems like a majority of erotic stories have sex scenes that are boring or use too much crude language or have no real feeling in them.  So agreeable is good.  Another good thing about this book is that it had an interesting and romantic story line in which the sex fit in naturally.",1
"Disclaimer: I got this for my Kindle when it was being given away for free.  It now is up to $2.80 but my review takes into account what I paid.I like Markhat the finder, a hard-boiled ex-military gumshoe in a fantasy land where trolls, vampires, and other creatures of the night interact with humans.  This novella/short story has some great dialog and I truly wish it had been longer.  I even paid $2.00 for another Markhat book, The Mister Trophy, hoping for more of the same and while it was equally as good as this book it was also equally as short.  If I consider the combined content of both books and consider the $2 I paid for them, I still rate them 5 stars.Apparently there is a third, longer Markhat book out now which for some reason isn't available for the Kindle.  Come on Frank, what are you and Samhain waiting for?",1
"This is the third book of his that I have read and I really enjoy them. They have great plots and characters, but aren't  overly complicated. My husband and I have a second home in Rancho Mirage (which is in the Coachella Valley) and we go to Palm Springs a lot and it's fun to read about a place that I know so well. I love his attention to detail and descriptive way of writing that draws you into his books. I would definitely recommend his books and I already have!",1
"There is a reason why Harlequin has been one of the top publishers around. Despite the hundred of books they had printed they still manage to produce short reads like this one.A nice heart tugging story of love lost and found.The only thing that bugged me was the title, really. I think that they could have thought of a better one.Harlequin Good read like always.",1
Interesting! It was a different twist to a menage story. I'm about to start the second one. What will that chick do next? I appreciate the idea of loving like this! I'm sure it would be fantastic! Now I need an actor who needs a normal every day wife.  ;-),1
This was a different read for me.  For the most part I did enjoy the book.  How difficult life is for people with mental issues. Good read.  I found it hard to put down..,1
"Let me start this review off by saying that no one, and I mean NO ONE can write for Boba Fett as well as Karen Traviss can.  When I saw this book on Amazon I was delighted and I was even more excited when I found out that she wrote it!***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***I knew from the Star Wars comics that the Mandalorians were involved in the Vong War during their invasion and that they fought alongside them against the New Republic.  But this e-book really helped fill in the gaps that the comics and the novels left.  I knew they weren't just in it for the credits!The visuals that Karen Travis paints with her story were just amazing!  Having Boba Fett walking through the depths of one of the Vong's ships was great!  I could almost smell the slime oozing from the walls and hear the squishing of his boots as he walked across the pulsing floor.  Also, having him compare being in the ship to being back inside the Sarlaac pit was very cool as well.During the book, the Mandalorians are faced with a moral dilemma.  They have signed up with the Vong, thinking they are just an army that wants to wreck a few worlds and they'll get some quick cash off of it.  But it turns out it's an entire invasion armada and they want to destroy the entire galaxy!  Boba Fett and the Mandalorians have already taken the job so they are honor bound to stand by their word and fight alongside the Vong against the New Republic.  However in doing so, Fett adds on that the Vong have to leave his home planet of Mandalore alone.  They agree and of course they are lying to him.  But this gives Boba Fett the time he needs to mobilize his people for war.  And when you have the entire population of the Mandalorian home world gunning for you, you might just want to reconsider your course of action!While fighting alongside the Vong, Boba Fett manages to sneak information to the New Republic about the Vong, their plans, their technology and their biology.  Eventually the New Republic wises up and realizes that the Mandos are double agents and they send a Jedi Master to parley with Boba Fett.  He tells the Jedi to keep this under wraps and to keep fighting against the Mandalorians as if they are the true enemy in order to keep up the ruse so they can continue to slip the New Republic information about the invaders.  The Jedi Master asks what Fett wants in return.  He only asks for one thing, that the Republic knows that a Mandalorian warrior died to save a Jedi Master.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***This book was awesome!  Karen Traviss continued to do what she did best in the Star Wars universe, writing for Boba Fett and the Mandalorians.  It really is too bad that she and the rest of the Star Wars writers had a falling out due to creative differences and that she is no longer writing for Star Wars.  I would have loved to read more of her work in a Star Wars setting.",1
"At first, I thought the book is a good read but after a few pages, I couldn't quite get what the whole book is all about. I understand that the author has his ""own"" way of writing, but this one got me really bored. The whole story is going off on all different directions, which tends to confuse the reader which usually results to loss of interest.The book is dissected in different sections, and lots of different parts that introduces one character or a single event on the book, it makes the book very uninteresting to read.",0
"How awful is this unfocused collection of words? Let me count the ways:1. There is no plot (that should be enough, but there's more).2. The heroine (for lack of a better word) is a paranoid, shallow mass of nothingness. We don't know if she could have had any more depth because the author provided absolutely no worthwhile character development. In fact, what little information the reader is given about her made her very unattractive. She is materialistic, narcissistic and moody for no clear reason. The very first page clumsily recalls how she picks a fight with her husband over absolutely nothing.Sadly, the pitiful introduction to her hair is the entire basis of the book, although the synopsis held so much promise. The husband is just there so the story can have a male counterpart; he is quite insignificant. If he mentions it once, he mentions it a thousand times that he wants to get to know his wife of seven years. What?!?3. Why does this author (for lack of a better word) make them have their only serious conversations right in the middle of the awful sex scenes, not once but several times? Weird. Other than that, there is no meaningful dialogue between the two of them.4. Some of the informational points are repeated, over and over, and over again. Why?5. If this is an IR romance, why was race in regards to their relationship never highlighted?6. Did I mention there is no plot?So, yes, this was an awful read and I now know to avoid this author. That is a shame because she has so many books available, which is incredible considering the lack of quality in her storytelling.Had I gotten this book for free, I would have paid too much.",0

"Jules Kingston has always known that it would be her duty as her fathers' heir to become Lioness of her Pride - she just didn't know she would have to assume this position so soon.  Her fathers have decided to step down as Leos of the Pride and in doing so have made Jules' life a living Hell.  It is the tradition of her Pride to have two Leos and one Lioness in charge.  Much to Jules' dismay, when her fathers step down, every lion in the direct vicinity is sniffing after her trying to get her to mate, and she's tired of it.  Ready to run, Jules comes face to face with the two men who have no qualms about claiming their mate.Luke and Gabe Beckett knew three years ago that Jules was destined to be their mate and went to her fathers to cinch the deal.  Of course, Jules' fathers neglected to tell her that bit of information and when she finds out, she does exactly what they'd thought she'd do--she tries to run.  She doesn't get very far and when she's caught by Luke and Gabe, Jules is taken to their home and claimed.  The mating will come later once she accepts her position.  Time is not on their side, however, because Luke and Gabe aren't the only lions wanting Jules.  Now they must accept a mating challenge with the hope that they will be the victors.Claiming Their Mate was a great book!  I loved how Luke and Gabe could sense Jules' thoughts and feelings and did their best to make her comfortable in her new home.  Jules' temperament often seemed off to me--I wanted her to care for the brothers as much as I could tell they cared for her. But, despite that, I enjoyed the foray in the White Sands Pride of lions.  Claiming Their Mate was sensual and highly charged.  It was a well written m&eacute;nage that was almost innocent in its sensuality because of the lack of a certain sexual position shown in most m&eacute;nage stories.  The ending was sublime, although it seemed a bit cut off because I would have loved to have seen Luke, Jules, and Gabe at home in their own bed loving each other.  However, that wasn't enough to keep me from reading another book by Paige McKellan.  She is on my radar now, and I can't wait to read more of her work!Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1

It brought back memories from my own childhood a few decades ago. I was reminded that there will always be hope in this world for people of faith.  If mankind could only truly learn to do unto others as we would have done done unto us, and if we were to open our hearts to the hope of tomorrow and the prospects of blessed eternity.  In this increasingly secular world mankind is loosing the ability to just enjoy our world.

"I loved all of her I-team series - this one was absolutely lame, well beneath her writing skills.  The characters had absolutely no strength, they came across as shallow and were grossly under-developed.  No research whatsoever was made for this story, unlike all of her I-team series books.

I really enjoyed this Scottish historical romance. I think it's one of the first I've read that was set in the mid nineteenth century where the characters weren't leaving the country. I look forward to reading more from this author and would definitely recommend it to others.,1
"I enjoyed the read.  The story concept works and the sex is definitely hot., the characters do things that are surprising and explained away as ""the way we do it."" The characters rarely speak to each other about the things that matter. They worry and wonder in their heads but don't share their thoughts when it really counts. I would love to see more backstory. There is definitely room to grow the characters.",0

This was the funniest laugh out loud book I have read in a long time.  Great story with great characters.,1
"The story follows two main characters and some good side ones. Keith is struggling to come to terms with a past he doesn't like. Abigail has been forced into a world she didn't know existed while her friend Dylan trying to accept that there are better packs out there than the one he was in. You meet two Alphas that are awesome people and one that sucks. There are plenty of struggles, lust, love, and comradeship to learn to love these well written characters. The action is well described and nail biting in a few spots. The ending leaves satisfied enough but with some questions unanswered to keep you wanting more. There are plenty of paths that this story can take and it will be a great series to continue.The story was definitely well written with great characters that are believable and easy to understand. The only negative I can really say is that there were plenty of instances where the writer kept saying she (Abigail) just doesn't understand this or that, and then offers no explanation. So, I kept reading ""She just doesn't know or understand..."", and I kept thinking no crap - could you explain it?!? Never really got that many answers though - which I suppose is why it's a series and they need to do that so you'll get the other books. It was a good read and I would recommend it.",1

"This is the story of a post (and continuing) apocalyptic planet with space stations as places people live to escape the planet Earth.  Great idea overall.There are action bits, bombs, running, killing, evil plots and good people.  So, there is a lot to the story.  Too much in fact. The insertion of everything imaginable (life, death, human engineering, enhanced people, natural people, alien types, mystical types, mutants, ghosts, goddesses, men plotting overthrow of government, Marshall law, love story, sex, nuclear war, space travel and fights, supernatural events and so on).  Due to so many plot devices, the story flow was rushed, overdone in some spots, incomplete in others.  And led to a lot of jumping around in tale that really (while ended) did not flow in cohesive /cogent manner with regard to story arc development overall.The contridictions of characters was just conveniently explained away without direction.  Just plopped into story via a tell vehicle when needed as was not in keeping with initial characterizations at onset of meeting character.  Or, not explained at all (why not all girls or women who met the goddess did not have hair color change - just two?  Why only one of those two branded with tattoo?  Those type inconsistencies never addressed.  We just need accept them...).  The guy was pretty accepting of kiss without real reason behind it.  ""No reason honey?  Oh, well then, okay.  Come on over and kiss me now."" (Um, not so much believable).  There were many such contrived bits that seemed like author started something and just was unable to come up with continuation or plausible conflict resolution.I think many will forgive the stilted pacing and the contrived conveniences due to novelty of premise.  I am not induced to purchase further installemnts as the writing (while interesting premise) was really not that good.  A run through for correcting errors related to grammar and punctuation would be beneficial.Christine",0

"Hmmm!!!Well I really don't know what to say that could be positive about this book except that I did get this for free on Amazon Kindle. What drew me to the book was the awesome book cover.  The story starts out with some some what interesting characters with the hint that they had some sort of powers and that some type of evil darkness was after them.  The story was disappointing to me because it seemed incomplete due to the fact it did not answer the questions of what sort of powers they had or what the evil darkness was.  Also since the characters know they are inhuman but they do not know what they are or why they exist.  It amazed me how I kept reading through the book hoping to learn the answers.The erotic sex scenes were medium and I thought the author over thought the scenes because sometimes the positions or movements were confusing.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good juicy love scene but it seemed the scenes were rushed and after one time in the bed the couple were magically in love when no where in the scenes does the characters show any kind of emotion except for wanting to rape each other sexually.I don't know, this story could have so much potential if the author would of added a little clearer details.  So sad.",0
I just can't seem to get enough of these happily ever books... So much passion and love. Where can I meet a Westmoreland?,1
this book wasnt very long but very good ! great book to spend a few hours on the couch with,1
"Pure trash, very nasty language.  It turns my stomach to read such trash.  Please consider removing it from the ""free"" book list.",0
"This book was written in a very simple and straight forward English with the voice of a Kentucky woman. I really liked to hear her story and how it was to live in rural US not even 100 years ago. We have gone through a complete change of poor America to a rich super power and this lady tells her life story and how it was.  As she said various time, &#34;we were tough&#34;.",0
"I completely enjoyed the FMP Society but that is due in great part to the fact that we have a friend who the book could easily have been written around. It is pretty much a straight forward plot and you will quickly guess where it is going. That, however did not make it any less enjoyable and Cara's response to the help she receives from her 3 fairy godmothers had me laughing out loud several times.",1
"This is an absolutely awesome buy if you're interested in starting the Steele series. Loved all the stories in this book including the first short story of Dane and Sienna. Loved all the Steele brothers and cousin Vanessa' stories. Chance and Kylie had a sweet and very funny coming together. Lots of mischief. Sebastian(Bas) and Jocelyn had a feisty and rocky road to travel. Also in that story was the very touching and loving story between Jocelyn's sister Leah and Reese the man she loved but left behind without a word. Then you have Morgan who finally found Lena Spears, his perfect woman, even if she doesn't agree with him. Can't not love a beautiful man that loves your family too. Last but not least Vanessa and sworn enemy, the delicious Cameron Cody, who like Morgan has wanted his woman from a far for too long and is tired of waiting. Taking matters into his own hands, he lays out a proposition she can't, and deep down doesn't want to refuse. All the stories in the bundle are well worth the read and I found them all thoroughly hot and enjoyable. Great value on a great read.",1
"I really enjoyed this book short, romantic & good soul book! it really is, a feel good book! you'll enjoy this book",1
"This wasn't one of Jack or Blake's best stories. I did love the ending! I'll continue to read their books, but this is one book I won't be reading again.",0
A bit surprising. If sex offends you don't read this book.  It is filled with it.  Right from the first few pages.  Good story.  I would like to see the Author come out with more in this series.,1
"This is a great story about a wonderful girl with an amazing singing voice and a wild and crazy family. She is just a regular 14 year old girl going to school and dealing with the snobby rich girl who seems to get her kicks from messing with her. Can she get a record deal? Will the snob and her minions ever leave her alone?Read this book, you will be glad you did! Now I am hungry for some chocolate gravy!!Hoping for book#2!",1
"When I read the beginning of this book I thought it sounded like a good urban romance, with a little bit of the paranormal thrown in.  Wrong!  There was a sketchy amount of story tucked around an enormous amount of graphic sex.  Not my thing, not what I expected.  Too many questions left unanswered, too many characters left dangling, but you get what you pay for.  I would have preferred a better developed plot and less sex.  I will not be reading any more of this author's work, and I'm sorry I read this.",0
"The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that the relationship between Dylan and Sasha gets off to a rough start. It seems awkward and juvenile somehow - as if they are both teenagers. It took the first whole section of the book to get me over this feeling I had of them. Although I liked Dylan from the first book he just seemed weak to me - I recognize he has that own opinion of himself so the self-talk he engages in certainly doesn't help the impression. His actions spoke louder than his words and I was convinced there was a great story for him and I was right!Now granted being around all those ultra alpha wolves was bound to cause issues but the mindset shift you have to go to in order to see Dylan as a sexy leading man is actually substantial based on how his character has been written. Or it was for me. I can't help it - he always comes off as like someone's kid brother.That said, however, I remain extremely impressed with the writing in this and the other novels in the series. By about 40 percent or so in I was fully in Dylan's camp and the relationship that started so off kilter had me completely invested and clicking away on my Kindle. Even Sasha starts coming across as a young woman with a purpose and power - before she just seemed too victim-ish. Sending the young couple on a road trip with Joe and Brynn was brilliant - and left a wide open opportunity to focus on them alone which was greatly needed.I cannot deny that the introduction of the vampire Adam was a huge plus in this book. I absolutely adore him already - his humor, his passion, his honor, and his complete understanding of what he is and what he is capable of. Now that's a character with bite (pun intended!)This is a series that is best read in order as the plot flows from one book to the next - moving the story along. I like it a lot - because there is an authenticity in it regarding power and the corruption it causes. There are many human paralell's here.Fans of paranormal series romance should pick this one up.",1
I enjoyed the story but wish it was longer. I like that there was character development and a plot to balance the sex.,1
"I wanted more to happen.  I wanted to know more about the characters than their lust, and he is always bringing up being a bastard.  God, that got so tiresome.  It also rambles.",0
Another delightful real estate story with a good twist and believable characters and story line.  I recommend it as a light read.,1
Part of a series - I would recommend reading in orderThe author did a good job with the relationship between Zack and Ace.  There was a lot of hot sex but also a relationship that had it's issues.  A nice continuation of this series.,1
I didn't even finish reading it.  Read a few pages and didn't likt it.  maybe a matter of taste but.....,0
this idiot was married to her master she had a staff at the mansion and the staff told her what to do the staff had more rights than she did. i hated this book it wasnt erotic it was stupid.,0
This book was funny smart-assed and with a little HOT sexy scenes thrown in for good measure!!! I wish it would have been longer and more story to it but for as short as it was I enjoyed the hell out of it!!!!,1
i really enjoyed the book-more than i thought i would. i would like to see  more in a full lenght book. and it was free!,1
"I loved this book for the originality of the basic  premise. I was not familiar with the Matthew Hope series, but will definitely read more. I have always enjoyed the 87th precinct series. His character development continues to be excellent.",1
